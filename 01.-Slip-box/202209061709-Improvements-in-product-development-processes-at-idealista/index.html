I have often found user researcher analyses that are just looking at 5 or 6 users and then we extrapolate this behavior to all idealista users. It is almost impossible to find all the answers in the databases but neither we can find them all in a few people that might not be representative of the universe of users at idealista.</p><p>We could try to build those &ldquo;personas&rdquo; and see the percentage of users that have that profile. Or the other way around, find segments of users analyzing the online behavior and then interviewing samples of those segments. In any case, we should try to learn how to blend qualitative and quantitative analyses to be more rigorous in our work, be able to prioritize better, and also have an impact on the design of the product.</p><p>In addition, we should try to learn how to work together the different roles: user researchers, UX designers, data analysts, and developers. In most projects, the different roles are disconnected and we incorporate some roles in the latter stages of the project, so they lack context about the decisions taken in the analysis phase by other roles.</p><a href=#what-do-you-think-could-be-improved-in-the-definition--design-phase><h3 id=what-do-you-think-could-be-improved-in-the-definition--design-phase><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What do you think could be improved in the Definition / Design phase?</h3></a><p>In the definition and design phase, we should also keep working as multidisciplinary teams. In the case of some projects, we spent a long time discussing issues that were eventually not feasible when presented to platform teams because they had an impact in other services. We faced this situation in the recommender system, but we had similar issues when we had to deploy the valuation service for auctions in Italy.</p><p>Also during the definition and design phase, it should be stated clearly the ownership of the different parts of the project. When there is more than one tech team involved it is sometimes not clear who owns what.</p><a href=#what-do-you-think-could-be-improved-in-the-development--implementation-phase><h3 id=what-do-you-think-could-be-improved-in-the-development--implementation-phase><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What do you think could be improved in the Development / Implementation phase?</h3></a><p>This is probably one of the main challenges we have as a company. We are too slow in the development process. It is especially painful when there are more than 2 development teams involved in the development process. We usually estimate developments &ldquo;for this quarter&rdquo;, &ldquo;in two quarters&rdquo; and so on. I think this sort of time estimate is way too long for most implementations.</p><p>As I said, I truly believe this is one of the critical risks for the company, as we are becoming slower and slower while the tech teams keep growing larger and larger. It is likely a complex problem with many causes (technical debt, lack of management skills/roles, no operations standardization, missing support teams, &mldr;), so it surely needs deep analysis and a strategy to be solved.</p><a href=#what-do-you-think-could-be-improved-in-the-project-follow-up-phase><h3 id=what-do-you-think-could-be-improved-in-the-project-follow-up-phase><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What do you think could be improved in the Project Follow-up phase?</h3></a><p>Once a team/role has finished its work in the project they are sometimes no longer informed about how the project is working. Some examples of this situation are the following:</p><ul><li>We sometimes don&rsquo;t even know if the solution is being used because it might be the case that it has been discarded in the implementation phase.</li><li>In many other cases we just have news about the project when there is a bug.</li><li>If the product is evolving we are not usually aware of new needs detected by new analyses and we are noticed long after a solution has been designed (which sometimes is not feasible and we need to go back to the analysis phase)</li></ul><p>I have noticed that the lack of context about how the project is running in the follow-up phase creates some disengagement in the teams. This reduces their willingness to work again on the project as they don&rsquo;t feel it is their project.</p><a href=#do-you-have-any-additional-comments-optional><h3 id=do-you-have-any-additional-comments-optional><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Do you have any additional comments? (Optional)</h3></a><p>Whether it is better collaboration processes, communication, operations, flows&mldr;</p><ul><li>Many of the issues exposed in the previous questions are caused by a lack
of communication and management of teams and processes. The challenge is how to improve context awareness in the teams while not having too many meetings. I truly believe that asynchronous communication is the way to go. Although many teams do great work in terms of documentation we usually face the problem of not being able to find this documentation. Confluence might be a great tool but we could try to standardize how we write documentation and organize it in a way that facilitates its discovery. We also face that in most of the teams we use different software for documenting and presenting our project increasing the difficulty for other teams to collaborate (Shadow IT apps use: Google Slides vs Microsoft Powerpoint, Miro vs Microsoft tool&mldr;)</li><li>Related to this issue in communication, we are usually not aware of what other teams are working on. We have this mail on fridays that presents the new features that are promoted to production, but we are not able to get to know what other teams are doing in previous phases. It would be great if we could share, as a company, what we are currently working on because we could reduce double efforts and also reuse some developments in different contexts.</li><li>Also related to communication and transparency, we could also incorporate to the documentation recorded videos of presentations and meetings that might increase the context provided to documentation.</li><li>About the processes: the team that develops a solution is the same team that deals with the bugs or issues in production. This creates a long-term burden for the team, making them slower in the development of new projects as they also have to deal with maintaining past projects. This way of working also creates the risk that only one team knows how to deal with a particular project.</li><li>About the organization. Some responsibilities are not clearly defined in the company. Who manages the projects? Is the product manager also a project manager? Is the product manager also responsible for the analytics of a project? Who is responsible that the data generated by a piece of software being correct? I think we should work on defining roles, processes, and responsibilities for each project in a standardized fashion. In some business units such as idealista/data, these challenges are even harder because there is no Product Manager and eventually some senior technical employees have to do the work as a Product Manager, a Project manager, and their technical role.</li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://pelayoarbues.github.io/js/graph.2d9e48dbe7ea47c0ef1c58296ce14448.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Jacky Zhao using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://pelayoarbues.github.io/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
