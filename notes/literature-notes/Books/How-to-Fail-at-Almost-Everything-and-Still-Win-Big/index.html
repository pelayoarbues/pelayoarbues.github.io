One might think that having a conscious strategy will do, but the truth is that we cannot disentangle the outcome and understand if it was this strategy or pure luck</p><p>Calling bullshit requires a system. It is based on consistency, for instance in at least two dimensions of the following:</p><ul><li>Personal experience</li><li>Experience of people you know</li><li>Experts</li><li>Scientific studies</li><li>Common sense</li><li>Pattern recognition</li></ul><a href=#the-tine-i-was-crazy><h1 id=the-tine-i-was-crazy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The tine I was crazy</h1></a><p>He could talk to his cat,being a song or read a poem but he could not talk to other humans. This lead to doctors, psychiatry and loneliness.</p><p>He had to speak at an event in front of 1000 people and he was wondering if he would be able to do it</p><a href=#the-day-of-the-talk><h1 id=the-day-of-the-talk><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The day of the talk</h1></a><p><code>when you stand in front of an audience your sensation of time is distorted. That's why inexperienced presenters speak too rapidly.</code></p><p>He puts himself in that situation because he embraces failure as a path to learn</p><a href=#passion-is-bullshit><h1 id=passion-is-bullshit><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Passion is bullshit</h1></a><p>Passionate people show high energy and are persuasive about their passion but they are also less risk averse.</p><p>Passion is a signal that you are good at something or that it is easy for you. Success causes passion more than passion causes success.</p><a href=#goals-versus-systems><h1 id=goals-versus-systems><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Goals versus systems</h1></a><p>Career advice by a CEO: Every time you land a new job you should start looking for a better one. Job seeking as an ongoing process as better deals has their own schedule. Instead of setting a goal such as his boss&rsquo; job, his system was to continually look for better options.</p><p>Goals makes you feel miserable once you achieve them. Systems makes you feel energetic as they succeed every time you apply the system.</p><p>We can think of goals as situations in which once you succeed you are done, while systems are those that you do periodically with an expectation that they will get you to a better place.</p><p>A system beats passion everytime.</p><a href=#my-system><h1 id=my-system><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>My system</h1></a><p>Build something easy to reproduce in unlimited quantities. This general strategy was narrow down with a focus on creativity.</p><a href=#deciding-versus-wanting><h1 id=deciding-versus-wanting><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Deciding versus wanting</h1></a><blockquote><p>if you want success, figure out the price then pay it</p></blockquote><p>Prices: sacrifice personal life for grades, putting off having kids, taking business risks&mldr;</p><p>Systems make the price lower so it may worth a go.</p><a href=#the-selfishness-illusion><h1 id=the-selfishness-illusion><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The selfishness illusion</h1></a><p>In terms of generosity, three kinds of people:</p><ul><li>Selfish</li><li>Stupid</li><li>Burden on others</li></ul><p>Advocates for selfishness understood as a long run view of the right choices for you and others. For instance invest time on fitness, eating right, pursuing your career and spending quality time with your family and friends.</p><a href=#the-energy-metric><h1 id=the-energy-metric><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The energy metric</h1></a><p>In order to make choices among different alternatives we can choose those that maximize ones energy. That leads to eating, dreamin, resting and also by having something in life that excites you.</p><p>Energy is something that gives you a positive lift, mentally or physically. It might be blogging, writing a book, exercising or building your own thing.</p><p>A positive externality of good energy is that it gives a boost to the people around you.</p><p>You should manage energy as budgets in a company, seeking to maximize lo#ng term growth.</p><a href=#matching-mental-state-to-activity><h2 id=matching-mental-state-to-activity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Matching mental state to activity</h2></a><p>You should match your mood and energy levels to the activity, for instance creative tasks at the beginning of the day or exercise at noon.</p><a href=#simplifiers-va-optimizers><h2 id=simplifiers-va-optimizers><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Simplifiers va optimizers</h2></a><p>Simplifiers look for the easy Pareto solution although knowing that extra effor would lead to better outcomes.</p><p>Optimizers aim for the best solution although it may increase the odds of failure.</p><p><code>Simplification is usually the right answer when you need communication with others. Optimizing might be worth when you so things on your own or with a closed partner</code></p><p>Humans are bad at good at following simple systems and these are also less subject to unexpected failures.</p><p>Simple systems are probably the best way to achieve success. Once you have success, optimizing begins to have more value.</p><blockquote><p>Simplification frees up energy and time.</p></blockquote><a href=#tidyness><h2 id=tidyness><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Tidyness</h2></a><p>If your work space is a mess it distracts you and steals your energy. Tidy up for an energy boost.</p><a href=#knowledge-and-the-lack-thereof><h2 id=knowledge-and-the-lack-thereof><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Knowledge and the lack thereof</h2></a><p>A big energy killer Is the fear that you do not know how to do something your job would require.</p><p>To avoid this:</p><ul><li>Ask questions and you usually find simple solution or cheap professionals that do it</li><li>Flash research in Google to check out are the stuff that worries you so much</li></ul><a href=#dont-be-an-asshole><h2 id=dont-be-an-asshole><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Don&rsquo;t be an asshole</h2></a><p>Being an asshole causes energy drains all around and it might involve spending energy cleaning up the mess you made.</p><a href=#priorities><h2 id=priorities><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Priorities</h2></a><ol><li>You.

Buttons: Exercise, food, sleep. Avoid depressing news.</p><p>Fake smiles, daydreaming fake it till you make it. Acting confident makes you feel confident. Feeling energetic makes you feel like playing a sport Playing a sport makes you feel energetic.</p><p>Success at anything has a spillover effect on other things. Once you become good at unimportant things such as hobbies or sports, you are more prepared to be successful in more important challenges.</p><p>You should manipulate your perceptions to whatever makes you happy, because you are probably wrong about the nature of reality anyway.</p><a href=#my-speaking-career><h1 id=my-speaking-career><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>My speaking career</h1></a><p>Asked for a price for giving a speech that he did not want to give he asked for 5k.</p><p>The speaking requests flowed in as he entered the speaking circuit after overpricing himself.</p><a href=#recognizing-your-talents-and-knowing-when-to-quit><h1 id=recognizing-your-talents-and-knowing-when-to-quit><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Recognizing your talents and knowing when to quit</h1></a><p>You can achieve something extraordinary by combining ordinary talents (vs gifted extraordinary innate world class talent)</p><p>You can recognise your talents by:</p><ul><li>Checking what you did obsessively as a kid</li><li>Tolerance for risk. We accept high risk when we expect high returns.</li></ul><p>A system to achieve success involves trying lots of different things (sampling). This contradicts the general wisdom of sticking to it.</p><p>How you can tell when to quit? Things that work out started out well.</p><blockquote><p>small successes can grow into big ones, but failures rarely grow into successes</p></blockquote><p>Successes have X factor, meaning that you should focus if a segment of the audience is enthusiastic about it, instead of focusing in average responses. X factor can be detected by what users do with your product, instead of what they are saying.</p><a href=#is-practicing-your-thing><h1 id=is-practicing-your-thing><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Is practicing your thing?</h1></a><p>Some people enter in flow mode when they are practicing (endless repetition) while for others this is hell on earth.
