My journey in Data Science began in Academia, where I earned my Ph.D. in Economics and spent 7 years as a researcher . Transitioning to the tech industry, I've held roles as a Senior Data Scientist at BBVA Next and Lead Data Scientist at Weplan before finding my home at idealista.

I'm known for my [ability](notes/My%20failure%20resume.md) to bridge the gap between complex data science concepts and practical applications. I thrive on problem-solving and embrace the challenges of [management](mocs/moc-management.md), tackling everything from strategy and processes to people development.

## My Achievements & Aspirations

Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working on exciting projects. Some of my proudest moments include:
