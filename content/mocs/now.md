Currently I am focused on:
- Devoting time to my wife and daughter.
- Learning and writing about [Management](mocs/moc-management.md) and how to apply Complex Problem Solving for leading change in organizations.
- Learning about Fine Tuning LLMs and Stable Diffusion models
- Sharing publicly this [digital-garden](mocs/digital-garden.md)
- Using generative AI to revisit master photographers' work [instagram.com/somekindalovesomekindahate](https://www.instagram.com/somekindalovesomekindahate/)
- Staying fit by going at least three times a week to the gym.
