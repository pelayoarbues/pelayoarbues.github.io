# Digital Garden

![digital_garden_midjouney](attachments/digital_garden_midjouney.png)

Welcome to my digital garden. It is a personal website where I can share my thoughts, ideas, and knowledge in an interconnected and non-linear way. Unlike a traditional blog or website, a digital garden is designed to be ever-evolving and growing, with the content being constantly updated and interconnected through hyperlinks, allowing for a more fluid and organic way of organizing and sharing information. You can find a great introduction to digital Gardens in this post by [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)

You can find the following notes in this garden:
1. Fleeting notes: These are brief notes taken when encountering new information. They are meant to be taken quickly, in the moment, and should be kept as short as possible. Fleeting notes serve as a reminder of the idea or information, and are meant to be processed later.
2. Permanent notes: These are more detailed notes that have been processed from the fleeting notes. Permanent notes should focus on a single idea or concept, and be written in the note-taker's own words. They should be organized in a way that makes sense to the note-taker, and linked to other relevant notes in the Zettelkasten system. The goal is to create a network of interconnected ideas that can be easily accessed and used for future writing or research.
3. Literature notes: These are notes that capture ideas or insights from books, articles, or other written works. They may summarize key points, highlight important quotes, or provide personal reflections on the content.
4.  Writings: The result of assembling permantent and literatute notes, writing a draft based on those ideas which is finally reviewd, corrected and polished.
