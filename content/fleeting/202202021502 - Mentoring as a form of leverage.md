The productivity (a.k.a leverage) of a developer/data scientist is measured as the impact produced by hour invested. At the beginning of our careers our impact is linear with the hours spent in a task, but as we grow in experience we can create exponential impact by mentoring junior people as explained in [[From entry level to senior+ developer - Multiply impact with developer leverage]].

The return of senior's work can be highly increased if the senior person takes time to teach an entry level colleague. This is because it reduces the development time in the current task of the junior and also teaches the junior how to do things. In this fashion, the senior does not have the monopoly of that skill and the junior can take care of maintenance or evolution while the senior can work on tasks only the senior can do.
