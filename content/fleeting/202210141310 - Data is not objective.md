Data has always been obtained with instruments and techniques that impose a particular structure to the information we aim to study. In addition we usually transform data. We also model the data and look for patterns. At the end we can conclude that data is not objective at all. (See [[MÃ¡s sobre el mito de la objetividad (especialmente, la data-driven)]])

Data driven sounds nice, but being data driven does not mean that you have found the ABSOLUT TRUTH and that you understand how world mechanisms operate. 

Remember the brain is a flawed lens through which to see reality.
