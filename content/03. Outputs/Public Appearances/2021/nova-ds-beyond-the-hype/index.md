summary: Webinar for Nova talent
abstract: You probably have heard that data is the new oil and all the hype about Artificial Intelligence. In this talk I will present some of the projects I have worked on in the past few years with a major focused on those built for idealista. My goal is to share my view on how Data Science (DS) might transform a lot of industries but keeping it real and how it is actually used. In this regard we will also talk about the skills needed to complete Data Science projects.
