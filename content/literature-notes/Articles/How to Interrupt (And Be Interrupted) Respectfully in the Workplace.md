## Highlights
- Many people are afraid to interrupt because they don’t want to seem rude. But not all interruptions are created equal. There are two kinds of interruptions:
  • **Bad interruptions** are when you can’t finish a thought without others cutting you off. Your listener is condescending, rude, and brash. They don’t respect you.
  • **Good interruptions** are when reasonable people have reasonable reasons to interrupt, and they do so respectfully. You have mutual respect and trust. They understand your point and want to make the best use of limited time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrda6yr3zsk6ymhks2c9he65))
- Obviously, you want to avoid bad interruptions. But you should encourage good interruptions too. Why? Limited time. When you’re short on time and it’s hard to get on your executive’s calendar, you need to be mindful of [backstory scope creep](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/start-right-before-you-get-eaten-by-the-bear). You can’t waste precious minutes on irrelevant tangents or issues you’re already aligned on.
  If people can’t interrupt you, the result is you may need to schedule another meeting (or three) to discuss what you could have done in one sitting. Not great ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrda7tppv5q1f1vf33kjhtdn))
- In some of my most productive meetings, I used talking points to kick off and had data ready to share, but went through 20% of what I prepared. But we discussed what was important and useful—that’s the goal. Getting to that is a win.

- I soon realized presenting front to end without any interruptions is actually quite rare. Many internal presentations are more like guided conversations—it was my responsibility to drive the meeting, but there was often dialogue, debate, and conversation.

- When you expect potential interruptions or questions, it takes the wind out of it being a surprise, so you’re much more likely to stay in control and take it in stride. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrdabacfckygavj2jj0hs3ab))
- **I know we’re short on time, and have a lot to cover. Feel free to raise your hand if I’m going too far down a direction you already know, or if you have questions along the way. The goal for today is to X and I’ll start by sharing a bit about Y and Z.”**
  Always frame your topic upfront—this prevents bad interruptions down the line because your audience knows what to expect and can stay focused. Sharing the agenda [serves as sign posting](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/sign-posting-how-to-reduce-cognitive) for what’s coming later.

- **Good question. That’s why I want to cover X because it actually addresses [the thing they asked about].”**
  • *Good question* - Saying *good question* isn’t about being nice. You’re starting on a positive note because you’re about to introduce conflict. The conflict: They asked you a question, and you’re flouting their expectations by NOT answering it. So you need to anchor on the warmer side of the spectrum to counterbalance.
  • *That’s why I want to cover X* - This redirects back to what you want to talk about.
  • *Because it actually addresses* - Position what you’re saying around their concern. You’re saying, “Actually I WILL address your question, but in a different way that really gets at the root of the issue, so stick with me.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrdadey6pqjh5nptz859vht4))
- **Good question. Let’s hold on that because what I’m about to share hits on the core of what I believe you’re asking, which is ___.”**
  Figure out the [question behind the question](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/question-behind-the-question) of what they’re asking. When you say *what I’m about to share hits on what I think is the core of what you’re asking*, you come from a place of curiosity and anticipating their needs. For an advanced strategy, you can interpret their question liberally to be essentially what you think they should have asked—not what they actually asked. Basically, you use this as an opportunity to reframe and redirect back to your main point. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrdafan2rh0m638pqr0650xa))
- **We can definitely talk about that, but we only have 15 minutes left. Are you good if I continue and share the most important things, then we can discuss?”**
  When you remind people of the cost of their tangent, most people are happy to continue. Most people do not want to schedule yet another meeting and add more work to their plate.

- **“Great question. [Quickly answer in 1 sentence] [Immediately redirect back to what you were saying].”**
  I do this one a lot and find it super useful. This removes tension from an unanswered question. You address it in one sentence, but don’t allow it to expand beyond that. You redirect immediately to bring it back to where you believe the conversation should go ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrdag62westfkey03a7gtb9j))
- This applies to all the scripts, but remember to take pauses when speaking. When you pause, you give people time to chime in without needing to cut you off. If you talk in one continuous run-on sentence, you appear less credible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrdagmcg8qjy99rdxn59hjac))
- One thing to note: It’s easier for senior folks to interrupt junior team members, than the other way around. If you’re a manager, be mindful not to steamroll others. Encourage your team to interrupt you—and when they do, reward them by reacting positively and thanking them for making the best use of everyone’s time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrdahbht16404qwqfxf81ec2))
- **Are you cool if I interrupt if you’re sharing stuff I already know or agree with? We only have 30 min and a lot to cover, so I want to make sure we get what we need.”**
  Getting permission upfront makes jumping in a lot easier down the line.
  When you say this at the beginning of the meeting, you set expectations and frame why the interruptions are beneficial. Mentioning the time limit reminds folks to be efficient. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrdaj526nbmqy9k2hnbfpxxh))
- **If you’re on video or in person, raise your hand.**
  This only works if you can see the person, but it’s one of the best ways to interrupt because it’s less aggressive and less likely to throw off the speaker ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrdakr7x3q8dcnr1zmrbyzxr))
- As an interviewer, I always had as part of my intro that I might interrupt them. And I explain that being interrupted is good because it means that I've already gotten their point and we can both save some time.
  I've apologized for how it might feel rude, but I'm determined to get all the information from them, which means being very efficient with our time. That usually helps a lot, and then I make a point to interrupt early on, so they can get used to the back and forth experience of a good interview, rather than giving me a presentation.
  The key is that it [speaking nonstop] might *feel* good for them, but it's bad for the outcome of their interview. It's in their best interest (and mine) that I interrupt. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrdanjkctak6zmmq9h9s5xvy))
- Related to waiting for them to take a breath / break so I can interrupt, what I usually do is raise one hand. Almost everyone recognizes the raised hand as a “let me say something.” Surprises them the first time, but works a bit like magic. I don't need to say “wait, wait.. wait a second,” I just raise my hand, their talking peters out, and I can move us along ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrdamv7r0de0fpyzamy6an0q))
- **Yep, yep. By the way, if I understand what you’re saying, I’ll jump in to let you know so we have enough time for important discussion items. Does that work?”**
  When you say *yep* while listening, jumping in feels less jarring than if you’re completely silent until you jump in. This one works better if you’re more senior. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrdap4902c2dmpbgkxz1dshv))
- **Start interrupting, then say] “Oh sorry! I had a question about X. By the way, is it cool if I interrupt with questions? I figured you’d want to know if I had questions, but we can save them for later too.”**
  Sometimes people speak without pausing for 15 minutes straight. When this happens, you may need to interrupt mid-sentence. If you do this, be a bit sheepish and call out the awkwardness. Apologize for it, but still jump in—because the cost of not jumping in is sitting through a monologue that isn’t a good use of anyone’s time.
