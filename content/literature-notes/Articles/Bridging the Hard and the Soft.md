## Highlights
- Historically, these interfaces have been rigid, representing the deterministic logic of the machine and relying on the user to translate the hard logic into a soft, meaningful form. With the rise of LLM capabilities, our technology is newly better at acting soft and squishy. Which brings the question: *how should our interfaces handle the transition from the hard logic of machines into the soft logic of humans?* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9m70afch8bagfz2a7088ses))
- Bridging materials of different types is hard to do well. Think of where a prosthetic limb meets the body — it needs to take advantage of multiple materials, bespoke engineering, and careful design to join the hard metal to the soft body.

- Note that we don't want to *completely replace* the deterministic logic of our machines with the squishy logic of our humans. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9m70whydt80degzs0vkr68z))
- Rigidity
  provides structure, stability, and predictability — especially important traits for familiar or safety-critical systems.
  On the other hand,
  softness
  brings flexibility and adaptability. It allows interfaces to mold to our needs, adjust to different contexts, and provide personalized experiences. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9m715wpsyht71nda2g2t72q))
