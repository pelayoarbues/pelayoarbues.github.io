## Highlights
- Zillow is [upgrading its AI search feature](https://zillow.mediaroom.com/2024-09-04-Zillows-AI-powered-home-search-gets-smarter-with-new-natural-language-features) with the ability to find homes or rentals based on how far away they are from your office, school, or other points of interest. Instead of narrowing your search by selecting specific locations or filters, you can now simply enter, “Homes 30 min drive from Millennium Park.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7gh1ftjmrch6y983gvhhxxs))
- Zillow will also let you search for homes to buy or rent based on affordability, such as “Seattle homes under $4,000 monthly.” Zillow [first rolled out AI search last year](https://zillow.mediaroom.com/2023-01-26-Zillows-new-AI-powered-natural-language-search-is-a-first-in-real-estate), allowing you to look for homes by describing their layout, location, style, condition, and more. But this update gives you more specific ways to peruse listings based on proximity to certain locations and pricing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7gh1z2dvaxbce132as4qsdq))
- Zillow says its enhanced search feature “takes users’ queries and scans millions of listing details to bring relevant results to the surface” while also training AI models to “better respond to search queries that use natural, human-like sentences.” It’s rolling out to Zillow’s iOS and Android apps now, with support on Zillow’s website coming soon.
