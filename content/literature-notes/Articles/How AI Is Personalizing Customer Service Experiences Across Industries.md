- Customizable, open-source [generative AI](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-ai/) technologies such as [large language models](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/) (LLMs), combined with natural language processing (NLP) and [retrieval-augmented generation](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/retrieval-augmented-generation/) (RAG), are helping industries accelerate the rollout of use-case-specific customer service AI. According to [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/where-is-customer-care-in-2024), over 80% of customer care executives are already investing in AI or planning to do so soon. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j74dzp4ab5yzmzgpspgxkgv4))
- For satisfactory, real-time interactions, AI-powered customer service software must return accurate, fast and relevant responses. Some  tricks of the trade include: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j74dztcrzw129x0m9kbqkx35))
- **Open-source** [**foundation models**](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models/) can fast-track AI development. Developers can flexibly adapt and enhance these [pretrained](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-pretrained-ai-model/) machine learning models, and [enterprises can use them to launch AI projects](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/) without the high costs of building models from scratch. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j74dzxdpmn91vv74169bvkfb))
- **RAG** frameworks connect foundation or general-purpose LLMs to proprietary knowledge bases and data sources, including inventory management and customer relationship management systems and customer service protocols. Integrating RAG into conversational chatbots, AI assistants and copilots tailors responses to the context of customer queries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j74dzydd380w7trgnah2z2mw))
- **Human-in-the-loop processes** remain crucial to both AI training and live deployments. After initial training of foundation models or LLMs, human reviewers should judge the AI’s responses and provide corrective feedback. This helps to guard against issues such as hallucination —  where the model generates false or misleading information, and other errors including toxicity or off-topic responses. This type of human involvement ensures fairness, accuracy and security is fully considered during AI development. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j74dzztmwnvyewnfvarj8r4a))
- The return on investment of customer service AI should be measured primarily based on efficiency gains and cost reductions. To quantify ROI, businesses can measure key indicators such as reduced response times, decreased operational costs of contact centers, improved customer satisfaction scores and revenue growth resulting from AI-enhanced services. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j74e02qjpgp2m5b6pwaq21fk))
- For instance, the cost of implementing an AI chatbot using open-source models can be compared with the expenses incurred by routing customer inquiries through traditional call centers. Establishing this baseline helps assess the financial impact of AI deployments on customer service operations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j74e079evtn4r996g7fqcqjt))
- To solidify understanding of ROI before scaling AI deployments, companies can consider a pilot period. For example, by redirecting 20% of call center traffic to AI solutions for one or two quarters and closely monitoring the outcomes, businesses can obtain concrete data on performance improvements and cost savings. This approach helps prove ROI and informs decisions for further investment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j74e0ddm37d9h84ry6szkq1j))
