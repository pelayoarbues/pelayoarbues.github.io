## Highlights
- what makes a **good human**? To know what a human should be good at, we need to look at **what is unique** about humans: We have a **soul** that **thinks** and **feels**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqsyjkchez74dfsbq8vm44xg))
- So for us to live a **good life** means to have an **excellent soul**. And this excellence reveals itself in a **clear intellect** and a **noble character**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqsyjpn80vvvtn7ft524x6b2))
- **1. The virtues of a clear intellect**
  Today, we often reduce all our mental abilities to “intelligence”. Aristotle went a bit deeper and identified multiple **theoretical virtues**:
  **Art** (techne) is the ability to **make things**.

  **Intelligence** (nous) is **intuitive insight** into underlying truths of our world.

  **Scientific knowledge** (episteme) is our **logical reasoning** about the world.

  **Prudence** (phronesis) is our ability to make **practical (moral) decisions**.

  **Wisdom** (sophia) is a comprehensive **understanding of deeper truths**.
  ![Wisdom](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/09_Sophia.gif?resize=288%2C173&ssl=1)
  These theoretical virtues help us understand what is **true** and **possible**. 
  And as important as they are, for Aristotle something else is just as vital for a good life: **our character**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqsynn34d0609y5vfqggp6zw))
- **2. The virtues of a noble character**
  A **good character** can **handle emotions** properly.
  ![Emotions](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/10_Emotion.gif?resize=120%2C81&ssl=1)
  We do that by finding the **right mean** between **two extremes**:
  **Courage** is the right mean between cowardice and recklessness.
  ![Courage](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/11_Courage.gif?resize=288%2C173&ssl=1)
  **Temperance** is the right mean between gluttony and abstinence.
  ![Temperance](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/12_Temperance.gif?resize=288%2C173&ssl=1)
  This right mean depends on the **person**. 
  ![Persons](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/13_Persons.gif?resize=381%2C157&ssl=1)
  An athlete might need more food than an office worker.
  It also depends on the **situation**.
  ![Situations](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/14_Situations.gif?resize=381%2C134&ssl=1)
  Sometimes it is better to avoid conflict, at other times it is worth it to stand our ground.
  ![Character](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/15_Character-1.gif?resize=288%2C144&ssl=1)
  We cannot study rules for proper behaviour. Instead, **we must train our character** through **habituation** to find the right mean appropriate to the circumstances.
  **Action!**
  In a **successful life**, the human soul fulfils its purpose through **virtuous actions**. 
  Are we born with those virtues?
  No. Aristotle says that humans have a **capacity** to be good, but it is up to us to develop our character. This is best achieved through **study** and **habit**. 
  ![Study and habit](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/16_StudyHabit.gif?resize=347%2C191&ssl=1)
  Excellence is not something you are, but something you **do**! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqsyp6z04mn2br6hgq4qngwg))
- For Aristotle happiness is achieved through a lifetime of **virtuous activity** of the soul, involving both **intellect** and **character**.
  ![Good life](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/17_Overview.gif?resize=476%2C406&ssl=1)
  So far so good, you might say—but isn’t happiness about **feeling good**? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqsypemqx67d4n489gvdh009))
- Aristotle does not deny that pleasure is fun. Money, fame and food are great and contribute to our happiness!
  ![Virtue and circumstances](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/18_Virtue-2.gif?resize=323%2C168&ssl=1)
  But these things are **not** essential to a good life. 
  One might even suffer greatly and still live a virtuous—that is: a good—life. When Aristotle speaks of a “happy” life, he means a **fulfilled** or **flourishing** life rather than a pleasurable one. 
  Such a virtuous life helps us find our place in the world. It is good simply because it suits our nature. Everything we do should ultimately serve the best we can be: a human soul with a clear intellect and a noble character.

  Happiness is not a feeling of pleasure. **Happiness is the pursuit of excellence**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqsypqe9fcdg8zcyvn8btwqp))
