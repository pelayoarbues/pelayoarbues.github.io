## Highlights
- Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning, is a new open-source library from Hugging Face to enable efficient adaptation of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all the model's parameters ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5q363sryqytrc465zjz76cp))
- QLoRA is a new technique to reduce the memory footprint of large language models during finetuning, without sacrificing performance. The TL;DR; of how QLoRA works is:
  • Quantize the pretrained model to 4 bits and freezing it.
  • Attach small, trainable adapter layers. (LoRA)
  • Finetune only the adapter layers, while using the frozen quantized model for context. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5q385mhse2bpdcwtwp0d95r))
