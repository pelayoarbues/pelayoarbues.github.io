## Highlights
- The models can handle up to 128k tokens of context. This was achieved through a multi-stage process: initial pretraining on 8k token windows due to resource limits, followed by continued pretraining that gradually increased the context length to 128k tokens over six stages. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3ma66geasvz9hjxxbfvpas9))
- With 128K context window Llama 3.1 will be great for RAG applications. And the main strength of 405B model is that it's ideal for distilling smaller, task-specific expert models. So from synthetic data generation to model distillation, the possibilities are limitless with Llama 3.1 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3ma54f9d4xr1w63mn8stfpr))
- Model distillation transfers knowledge from a large teacher LLM to a smaller student model, aiming to maintain performance while reducing computational requirements. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3ma5bjdbm6ss6p5fq2z3am9))
- The process typically involves training the student model to mimic the output distribution of the teacher model, often using softmax with temperature scaling to emphasize informative soft targets. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3ma5ktkhznxmd1m8pnk45d4))
- The current released version of Llama-3.1 is not yet multimodal. The image, video, and speech capabilities are integrated into Llama 3.1. However, these models are under development and not yet broadly released. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3ma4rbznt73ztnc8hrq730m))
- Andrej Karpathy's "Zero to Hero" course on neural networks is a comprehensive guide that takes learners from foundational principles to advanced techniques. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3ma20592mj0ac8e2grwnx7a))
- This course features a series of YouTube videos and a GitHub repository containing Jupyter notebooks and exercises. It covers everything from basic neural network concepts to building sophisticated models like GPT. Each lecture is designed to provide hands-on experience and deepen understanding of neural networks.
