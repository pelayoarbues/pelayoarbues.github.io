## Highlights
- LLaMA isn’t fully “open”. You have to agree to [some strict terms](https://forms.gle/jk851eBVbX1m5TAv5) to access the model. It’s intended as a research preview, and isn’t something which can be used for commercial purposes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfmnp53d65zn2sv7tzqq4ne))
- People could now generate images from text on their own hardware! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvqxg6s3x4sv3b11w1ka5d5s))
    - Note: Large language models have enabled people to generate images from text using their own hardware. This has enabled a stable diffusion of the technology, allowing more people to use and explore the capabilities of language models.
- I thought it would be a few more years before I could run a GPT-3 class model on hardware that I owned. I was wrong: that future is here already. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfmnerbja16d00vepphbvwe))
- Stable Diffusion moment is happening again right now, for large language models ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvqxhk6jjcyd4erf5xpp0ht1))
- But there are a ton of very real ways in which this technology can be used for harm. Just a few:
  • Generating spam
  • Automated romance scams
  • Trolling and hate speech
  • Fake news and disinformation
  • Automated radicalization (I worry about this one a lot) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfmnzy09ycft42042w1xrpy))
- LLaMA will likely end up more a proof-of-concept that local language models are feasible on consumer hardware than a new foundation model that people use going forward. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfmq54tyrsdvs9rd8vjb94c))
