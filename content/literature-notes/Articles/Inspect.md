## Highlights
- Welcome to Inspect, a framework for large language model evaluations created by the [UK AI Safety Institute](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ai-safety-institute). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyhgqpxkw9x2s0m629y74ry5))
- Inspect provides many built-in components, including facilities for prompt engineering, tool usage, multi-turn dialog, and model graded evaluations. Extensions to Inspect (e.g. to support new elicitation and scoring techniques) can be provided by other Python packages. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyhgqsf90nzcdz81qt7j1gtp))
- To develop and run evaluations, you’ll also need access to a model, which typically requires installation of a Python package as well as ensuring that the appropriate API key is available in the environment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyhgrfqdh6880aeax3m17eqe))
- In addition to the model providers shown above, Inspect also supports models hosted on Azure AI, AWS Bedrock, and Cloudflare. See the documentation on [Models](https://ukgovernmentbeis.github.io/inspect_ai/models.html) for additional details. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyhgrr0p53g5whhf76z5zvd6))
- Let’s take a look at a simple evaluation that aims to see how models perform on the [Sally-Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally%E2%80%93Anne_test) test, which assesses the ability of a person to infer false beliefs in others. Here are some samples from the dataset: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyhgs90devq9d8trcnx1vt0x))
- Note that this is a purposely over-simplified example! The templates used for prompting, critique, and grading can all be customised, and in a more rigorous evaluation we’d explore improving them in the context of this specific dataset.
