## Highlights
- Today, we release **FLUX1.1 [pro]**, our most advanced and efficient model yet, alongside the general availability of the beta **BFL API**. This release marks a significant step forward in our mission to empower creators, developers, and enterprises with scalable, state-of-the-art generative technology. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9h8yn1enpw9cf3m4hbmr0mj))
- FLUX1.1 [pro] provides six times faster generation than its predecessor FLUX1.1 [pro] while also improving image quality, prompt adherence, and diversity. At the same time, we update FLUX1.1 [pro] generating the same output as before, but two times faster. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9h8ypyr6yr9xqr0m0a0fq0j))
- **Superior Speed and Efficiency**: Faster generation times and reduced latency, enabling more efficient workflows. FLUX1.1 [pro] provides an ideal tradeoff between image quality and inference speed. FLUX1.1 [pro] is three times faster than the currently available FLUX.1 [pro]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9h8yscs82hkkayq0dcj1g96))
- **Improved Performance**: FLUX1.1 [pro] has been introduced and tested under the codename “*blueberry*” into the Artificial Analysis image arena ([https://artificialanalysis.ai/text-to-image](https://artificialanalysis.ai/text-to-image/arena)), a popular benchmark for text-to-image models. It surpasses all other models on the leaderboard, achieving the highest overall Elo score. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9h8ytn9drbdqt83hr81nkvr))
- **Fast High-res coming soon:** FLUX1.1 [pro], natively set up for fast ultra high-resolution generation coming soon to the API. Generate up to 2k images without sacrificing any of the prompt following. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9h8z023bkatr2ybnz56xb3g))
- **Advanced Customization**: Tailor the API outputs to your specific needs with customization options on model choice, image resolution, and content moderation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9h8z8cxaz6x0mpb3mv4d2qr))
- **Scalability**: Seamlessly scale your applications, whether you are building small projects or enterprise-level applications. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9h8zbns6q27rmpabr39s5e3))
- **Competitive pricing:** The API offers superior image quality at a lower cost. The pricing for our FLUX.1 model suite is as follows:
  • FLUX.1 [dev]: 2.5 cts/img
  • FLUX.1 [pro]: 5 cts/img
  • FLUX1.1 [pro]: 4 cts/img ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9h8zgxy67exry3g0byrsq79))
