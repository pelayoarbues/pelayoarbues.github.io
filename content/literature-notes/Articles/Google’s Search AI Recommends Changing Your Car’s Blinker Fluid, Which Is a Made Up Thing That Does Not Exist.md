## Highlights
- Case in point: as one X-formerly-Twitter user [pointed out](https://x.com/daltoneverett_/status/1792320370839585080?s=46) over the weekend, AI Overview will respond to the search entry "blinker not making sound" — which would ideally return helpful, expert-penned posts or videos that help googlers figure out why their car's blinker isn't working — with the advice to "replace the blinker fluid." Which, again, is not a real thing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyecvfjhsy669jgpqykhr0tc))
- The blinker fluid advice is one of [many instances](https://futurism.com/the-byte/google-sge-bad-answers) of AI Overview [failing](https://futurism.com/google-search-ai-melt-eggs) to provide correct information, often due to terrible sourcing. To wit: recently, [Redditors](https://www.reddit.com/r/comedyheaven/comments/1cq4ieb/food_names_end_with_um/) prompting the feature with the search "food names end with um" noticed that the AI search function will return the woefully incorrect response of "Applum, Bananum, Strawberrum, Tomatum, and Coconut" — which was stolen from an [obviously ironic answer](https://www.quora.com/What-fruit-name-ends-with-UM) to the same question posted years ago in a Quora forum.

- Speaking of bad sourcing, [as *Jalopnik* points out](https://jalopnik.com/googles-new-ai-overview-says-you-might-need-to-change-y-1851488127), Google's blinker fluid gaffe is actually derived from a common joke. Those who know their way around vehicles are well aware that blinker fluid doesn't exist, so telling a less-car-savvy person that they need to "replace blinker fluid" is a old inside quip. You can even buy empty blinker fluid bottles as a joke; indeed, the "source" that AI Overview cites is a comment in a [wildly random travelers' forum](https://community.goodsam.com/t5/technical-issues/turn-signal-makes-no-clicking-sound/td-p/3580027#:~:text=You%20are%20probably%20low%20on%20Blinker%20Fluid%2C%20should%20replace%20every%202%20years%20or%20so) in which the commenter includes a clearly ironic photo of one of these empty bottle gag gifts with the phony advice that one "should replace" the fake fluid "every 2 years or so....."

- Great things happening in the infosphere. The future of search is here, we guess — but it's still very much under construction, and might break the internet in the process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyecws7dkwmr5kfznbs2svdr))
