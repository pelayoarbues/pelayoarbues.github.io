## Highlights
- Sometimes, well-thought-out proposals backed by extensive research and data will fail to convince decision-makers. But a demo of a simple prototype will get them excited and ready to commit ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtq4sm0vmrkgxhdbwekvk4pz))
- While we should still [start projects with a one-pager](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/what-i-do-before-a-data-science-project-to-ensure-success/#first-draw-the-map-to-the-destination-one-pager) to clarify, socialize, and get feedback on our ideas, if we’re not making headway, one option is to build and demo a prototype. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtq4tc9p4fw6snz8a8wd936b))
- Prototypes make **our vision more accessible**. For non-technical laymen, ideas and designs can be *too abstract*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtq52pk6a97n7fpp75nk66s0))
- prototypes—especially those with a graphical user interface (GUI)—make it easier to understand the deliverable’s look and feel. By helping others understand our ideas better, we increase our chances of getting buy-in. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtq52xxjyekmpaawexeq0yx3))
- Is that *really* doable?” By building a prototype, the proposal becomes real and achievable, making it easier to convince decision-makers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtq53twxrq2jd5fw0vw45d6a))
- It always seems impossible until it is done.” – Nelson Mandela ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtq5402gw3wy0wme5znq5wt5))
- Last, prototypes make it **easier to get feedback**. Instead of attending a presentation or reading a proposal, people can interact with our app. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtq5497swrwn0nbvw84gaps2))
- While prototypes can show “What does it look like?” and “How will it work?”, **they don’t explain “Why should we build it?”** Thus, if the *“why”* for the project is still unclear, we’re better off writing a [one-pager](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/what-i-do-before-a-data-science-project-to-ensure-success/#first-draw-the-map-to-the-destination-one-pager) to clarify the problem, intent, and success criteria. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtq555zz5apny56gqj7hc46b))
- it doesn’t matter how well our prototype works if it doesn’t solve the *right* problem ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtq5595g20326vkd6rxczywq))
- No matter how good your tech is, non-technical users are unlikely to try unless it has a GUI and is easy to use. Since then, I’ve always taken the time to add a simple GUI to my prototypes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtq6b2rq6eyj4zsjpkgaakqm))
