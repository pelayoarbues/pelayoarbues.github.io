- Copilot is *your* AI assistant — it works for you — and Copilot Studio enables you to easily create, manage and connect agents to Copilot. Think of **agents as the new apps for an AI-powered world**. Every organization will have a constellation of agents — ranging from simple prompt-and-response to fully autonomous. They will work on behalf of an individual, team or function to execute and orchestrate businesses process. Copilot is how you’ll interact with these agents, and they’ll do everything from accelerating lead generation and processing sales orders to automating your supply chain.

- Earlier this year, we [announced](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/microsoft-copilot-studio-building-copilots-with-agent-capabilities/?msockid=3ba71385d1d06b0c22db0159d0fd6a48) a host of powerful new capabilities in Copilot Studio, including the ability to create autonomous agents. Next month, these capabilities are shifting from private to public preview, allowing more customers to reimagine critical business processes with AI. Agents draw on the context of your work data in Microsoft 365 Graph, systems of record, Dataverse and Fabric, and can support everything from your IT help desk to employee onboarding and act as a personal concierge for sales and service.

- New autonomous agents enable customers to move from legacy lines of business applications to AI-first business process. AI is today’s ROI and tomorrow’s competitive edge. These new agents are designed to help every sales, service, finance and supply chain team drive business value — and are just the start. We will create many more agents in the coming year that will give customers the competitive advantage they need to future-proof their organization.

- • **Sales Qualification Agent:** In a profession where time literally equals money, this agent enables sellers to focus their time on the highest priority sales opportunities while the agent researches leads, helps prioritize opportunities and guides customer outreach with personalized emails and responses.
  • **Supplier Communications Agent:** This agent enables customers to optimize their supply chain and minimize costly disruptions by autonomously tracking supplier performance, detecting delays and responding accordingly — freeing procurement teams from time consuming manual monitoring and firefighting.
  • **Customer Intent** and **Customer Knowledge Management** **Agents:** A business gets one chance to make a first impression, and these two agents are game changers for customer care teams facing high call volumes, talent shortages and heightened customer expectations. These agents work hand in hand with a customer service representative by learning how to resolve customer issues and autonomously adding knowledge-based articles to scale best practices across the care team.

- As agents become more prevalent in the enterprise, customers want to be confident that they have robust data governance and security. The agents coming to Dynamics 365 follow our core security, privacy and responsible AI commitments. Agents built in Copilot Studio [include guardrails and controls](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/blog/power-apps/it-governance-controls-for-your-copilot-agents/?msockid=09cbdd77556e64e60465cefe54d465ae) established by maker-defined instructions, knowledge and actions. The data sources linked to the agent adhere to stringent security measures and controls — all managed in Copilot Studio. These include data loss prevention, robust authentication protocols and more. Once these agents are created, IT administrators can apply a comprehensive set of features to govern their use. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaqqhtvqjpwqbasby6htybg3))
