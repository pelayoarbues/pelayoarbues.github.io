## Highlights
- In a year dominated by a confusing market, major advances in AI, and disruptors fighting for survival – [Zillow](https://www.mikedp.com/zillow) has arguably released its most ambitious product since iBuying: [Listing Showcase](https://showingtimeplus.com/solutions/listing-showcase). 
  **Why it matters**: Listing Showcase represents a new business model – from pay-per-lead to pay-per-listing – which is aligned to how Zillow’s very profitable international peers monetize their market-leading positions.

- **The Listing Showcase product** promotes a specific listing with larger photos, enhanced agent branding, and premium placement in search results.
  • It’s also exclusive in each market, providing participating agents a unique advantage over other agents (“only *my* listings are enhanced in this market, making your property stand out”). 
  • The result is a high profile listing with strong agent branding, ideally leading to more *seller leads* for partner agents.

- **Dig deeper**: For years, seller leads have been the mythical holy grail of online real estate – incredibly valuable, but very difficult to generate at scale.
  • One surprise of the last five years was iBuying, which despite its challenges, turned out to be a great way to generate high quality, high intent seller leads (read more: [Zillow's billion dollar seller lead opportunity](https://www.mikedp.com/articles/2018/11/12/zillows-billion-dollar-seller-lead-opportunity)). 
  • Before it was shut down, Zillow Offers was generating tens of thousands of valuable seller leads per month.

- **Like its overseas peers**, Zillow is using the concept of scarcity to increase the value of Listing Showcase; if it were available to any agent willing to pay, it would confer no unique advantage – but offered on an exclusive basis, the value becomes exponentially higher. 
  • Without an MLS, nearly all international portals charge agents (or home sellers) on a pay-per-listing basis, with multiple tiers of enhanced exposure. 
  • Australia’s REA Group is masterful in the art of premium listings, which always include larger photos, premium placement in search results, and enhanced agent branding – all of which are features of Zillow’s Listing Showcase.

- By only promoting the listing agent, Listing Showcase will cannibalize Zillow’s existing buyer lead business – but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.
  • Listing Showcase is a hedge against any potential impact from the various lawsuits that may restrict or change buyer agent commissions. 
  • It also neutralizes the threat of CoStar's "your listing, your lead" product offering. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s3t0vvxha6p9pt88z8ky89))
- Listing Showcase is a serious, credible attempt by Zillow to expand its business from selling leads to selling *exposure*.
  • Modeled on its international peers, Listing Showcase has the hallmarks of a classic pay-to-play premium product, which, on a per listing basis, is a significant endeavor for the company.  
  • At its best, it’s a potential premium revenue stream that’s good for agents (the ones that pay), consumers, and Zillow's bottom line. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s3tap7pc931p1kqv0kxd10))
