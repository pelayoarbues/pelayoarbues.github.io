## Highlights
- Real estate investments involve a multitude of service providers, each producing and requiring data that needs to flow seamlessly to the top. However, this often results in fragmented data stacks, with companies operating multiple, non-integrated software platforms. For example, some real estate funds use up to 40 different software platforms to manage their data, “and none of them communicate with each other,” according to Lisa Stanley, CEO at OSCRE International. This fragmentation significantly impacts ROI, due to poor-quality financial data during the acquisition process and operational inefficiencies – the blindfolds that hinder investors as they attempt to solve problems.
  Whether its risk-averse mindsets slowing technological integration, or internal departmental power dynamics (where different teams hoard information and data), fragmentation can stem from various parts of investment businesses. If investors can address this data fragmentation, then they can successfully avoid the inefficiencies and costs that come with it, and open doorways to major organisational improvements. For instance, using AI in investment decisions can become an actionable reality, rather than an unattainable dream, as the high-quality, standardized data required by models to function accurately becomes more readily available.

- The most successful real estate investment companies are negotiating the challenges in digital transformation by carefully analyzing the opportunities and risks on the top management level, understanding the implications far and beyond their IT departments, and adopting a data-driven approach when doing so.
  This strategy involves integrating financial data across various platforms, enhancing data quality, and ensuring seamless access to critical information. This helps achieve significant improvements in ROI, including increased sales prices, faster due diligence, clearer strategy, faster and higher quality investor reports, and greater efficiency across the property management portfolio. If companies can effectively adopt this data-driven approach, then they are able to remove the blindfold and tackle the Rubik’s cube with an advantage over others in their industry.
