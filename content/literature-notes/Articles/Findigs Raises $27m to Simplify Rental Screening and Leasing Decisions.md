## Highlights
- Findigs is taking a unique approach, tackling these interconnected factors at once to unlock a better experience for both sides of the equation. While other screening tools fit in as one part of the decision-making process, Findigs intakes complex rulesets and measures applicants holistically against them. In a single platform, the company has combined best-in-class fraud detection with a proprietary ruleset orchestration engine, resulting in up to 50% reduction of bad debt for operators. Additionally, Findigs speeds up the rental decision process from an industry average of one week to an average of less than one day.
  “Today, renters wait days for a decision about where they’re going to live because property managers have no choice but to painstakingly review each application,” said Steve Carroll, Co-Founder and CEO of Findigs. “Findigs does the hard work under the surface to enable an immediate, transparent answer. This completely transforms the experience for both sides.”
  Alongside the Series B funding comes the launch of DecisionAssist: a breakthrough full-service screening offering from Findigs. Powerful automation is used to apply decision rulesets systematically, while advanced fraud detection tools operate in sync with support from Findigs specialists. While competitors merely promise to compile and source information, they leave it up to their customers to figure out what to do with that information. DecisionAssist removes the need for leasing teams to manually review applications, much less spend time gathering documents, judging IDs, or cross-checking endless streams of data. Leveraging rich multi-source data analysis, with AI and human expertise, DecisionAssist offers a holistic, one-stop solution unlike anything on the market.
