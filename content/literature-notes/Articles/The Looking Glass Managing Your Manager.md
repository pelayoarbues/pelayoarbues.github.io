## Highlights
- It’s common for people to think of their managers as *executioners*. As in, “If my manager catches me doing , they will axe me!” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxk2sez4f2xa10g5kq7cksp))
- In this mental model, the manager creeps around policing rules and judging for negligence. The underlying emotional current is *fear*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxk2tem0yh5dfcg0292zwtw))
- It’s also common for people to think of their managers as *white knights*. As in, “My manager will defend me against and fight to get me a promotion!” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxk2z2g45fvm7bpznpv5a60))
- In this mental model, the manager takes up your cause and provides for your dreams. The underlying emotional current is *pining*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxk33xfphyeyzajznw1t6jx))
- Of course, it’s easy to see why we believe them — the challenge with the manager-report relationship is an imbalance of power. Managers can fire or promote us far more easily than we can fire or promote them. So we end up thinking that managers have an “edge”, and as a result we unconsciously make them the main characters in the story of our career advancement.

- ***You*** **are the main character in your career journey** — this is the singular belief that will transform your relationship with your manager. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxk3tgqkj544ne3rg0tbzf0))
- **your relationship with your manager sucks…**
  Here are 7 step-by-step actions you can take:
  1. First, understand what a great relationship looks like.
  Do your research. Ask your friends. Write down the qualities you’re looking for.
  2. Describe to your manager the relationship you’re aspiring for. 
  Bring up your vision in your next 1:1. See if your manager agrees.
  3. Explicitly describe to your manager what you’d like their help with. 
  Are you hoping for more context? More feedback? On what issues? Be specific.
  4. Give your manager feedback at least once a month on how well they are helping you with what you asked. 
  Share what you appreciate, and ask for more of what you want.
  5. Ask your manager for feedback at least once a month. 
  [Feedback is a gift](https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-holding-up-the) that helps you understand your blind spots.
  6. If your manager ignores actioning on your strong feedback multiple times, let your manager’s manager know. 
  If you’re disappointed and losing hope your manager will change, it’s time to escalate.
  7. If your manager’s manager does nothing, and you find yourself having lost trust in the entire management chain, it’s time to seek greener pastures. 
  Life’s too short to work with people who lose your trust. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxk4kfb4yp8vmh42qg02dtb))
- The best relationships are built on trust. Ask yourself: “*Do I trust my manager to do their job well? Does my manager trust me to do my job well?*” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxk5r8vrvgh5q4tnrf2htkj))
- Of course, you can’t answer that without knowing what *doing the job well* means. This is the first thing you and your manager must align on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxk5yg9gvvvstv3wseq4hsm))
- This seems obvious, but I cannot tell you how many people come to me frustrated because they think their manager’s job is to have their backs which means “wholeheartedly support my ideas”, while their manager thinks their job is to get quality output which means “critique my reports’ work and push them for better ideas.” This is a subtle misunderstanding, but it repeated minor tensions which erode trust like waves crashing against a cliff. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxk6115dapr9b5aj93m4v6d))
- Ask yourself: do you *really* understand how your manager sees success for *their* role? If not, ask this in your next 1:1: “I’m really curious how you think about your role. What makes you feel you’re doing a great job?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxk6cn55g91kbdhggtx1c1w))
- Once your manager gives their answer, you might find elements you’re curious about. Keep following that curiosity to expand your understanding. “So alignment with XYZ is a big part of your role? How much energy do you spent on that versus on ABC?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxk6zc7bj7zmhy059a8y76n))
- A natural extension to this question is to then turn the spotlight on yourself. “How about for me? What would make you feel *I’m* doing a great job?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxk78kqh7jpg67tc9qy3za9))
- Once you get your manager sharing, you’ve created space for you to share also. So follow up their answers with: “Here’s what would make *me* feel really engaged and successful in my role…” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxk7arken6x59pz4rv6y7yy))
- After everyone’s hopes and dreams and success criteria are on the table, the task becomes to mold these pieces into a vision for a great relationship. “Let’s figure out how to help each other both succeed…” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxk7gm4zwerq8ywqx7gr072))
- A shared goal is the backbone of a trusting relationship. Before you start with evaluations and judgements, make sure you’ve explicitly [mind-melded](https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-the-power-of-the) on this piece.
