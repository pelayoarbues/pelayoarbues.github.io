## Highlights
- Yes, it's indeed one of the world's most advanced large language models. Many people use it for chatting, consulting, and document reading. With the introduction of GPT-4's capability to process web content, PDFs, and images, it opens up a wide range of possibilities, including generating prompts for uploaded images.

- Not bad, but we're still a bit away from our goal. That's okay; let's work on refining it.
  Here, I described the text structure I want for the prompt (personal preferences may vary), and I also hope it uses concise, clear, and objective language for description. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hf3ww6bqxnygn3aktjq4f3v1))
- It's getting better, and it's already better than most labeling tools, isn't it? But experienced trainers won't stop here.
  I asked it to refer to the well-known tags from the Danbooru/Gelbooru specific dataset and to prioritize using these well-known tags in labeling images in similar prompts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hf3wwnc0a08yaefmywdyw33t))
- Great, this already goes far beyond my own ability to craft prompts. Of course, let's add a bit more complexity. My personal preference is to describe the visual style and theme of the scene in the beginning of the text. Now, let's have it do that.

- Perfect! At least for me, I'm really starting to like this GPT guy more and more!
  Now, I'll have it summarize all the rules mentioned above and put together a set of text for future use.

- While writing this article, I learned about the emergence of GPTs and there will be more GPT-based apps in the future, which is simply fantastic, isn't it? I'm also trying to use it to create my own prompt robot. Right now, it's still a work in progress, and it doesn't always cooperate as expected. I'm constantly fine-tuning it. When the time is right, I think I might share it with others to benefit more people.
  Well, that's the sharing for today. I have to admit that there were many challenges in debugging GPT. I simplified some of the steps here, but the overall logic remains unchanged. Once you successfully debug it, congratulations, you'll have an unprecedented, smart, and convenient labeling tool at your disposal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hf3wybwacz4433qq3qyd581g))
