## Highlights
- Looking back at the talking points from Property Portal Watch 2010 it seems that classifieds aggregators caused a stir in the real estate portal industry when they first sprang up.
  Real estate marketplaces didn't know whether they were a threat, an ally or both at the same time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j12q1mes2hkq8tevptfg1jbv))
- Fifteen years or so later and now it seems like time might be up for aggregatorsâ€”their business model deemed an inessential middleman by the market and their USP eroded on one side by savvy portals and on the other by Google's relentless drive to eliminate click-throughs.

- Unlike real estate verticals like Zillow or Rightmove, aggregators like Trovit and Mitula are hardly household names. So what are these businesses and what is their value proposition? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j12q3vyas25r412d1rhkgp2z))
- Often we see the likes of Zillow and Realtor.com being referred to as 'aggregators' but the businesses we're talking about here sit one level further away from the transaction.

- Whereas portals typically take listings from most of the agents in their market via the agents' CRM software, aggregators will take listings from portals via XML feeds. If they can't convince portals to build (and, importantly, maintain) an XML feed for them, they will often just scrape the listings directly from portal websites.

- Once it has the listings from all the portals in a market, an aggregator will get to work building results pages that outrank the portals' pages on Google, especially for more complicated 'long-tail' search terms. The idea is that because the aggregator has more listings than any individual portal and it has set up its SEO specifically for long-tail searches, it can attract a significant volume of Google searchers to its results pages.

- A user might search Google for "3 bedroom houses for rent with double garage and a garden in Bristol". In an ideal scenario for the aggregator the user would click from Google to the aggregator at the top of Google's results, then they'd click from the aggregator to the portal where they'd fill in a form to be connected with the agent listing the property.

- From Google to an aggregator to a portal to an agent. You can see how the aggregator's position as a middleman was always a precarious one but they've been around for a long time and made a lot of money acting as a source of 'extra' traffic for portals.
