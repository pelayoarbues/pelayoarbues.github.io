## Highlights
- For open-domain QA, the models are not restricted to a specific domain. The texts are retrieved from sources such as books, the internet, Wikipedia, tables, graphs, knowledge bases, etc. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4ddfv24a1se54c9b1v73w9t))
- In closed-domain QA, the models are geared towards a specific domain, such as documents focused on the legal and healthcare sectors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6q9tm0mhgcdatyx4y46kwk))
- Open-book QA is where the model has access to external sources of data to answer questions, including Wikipedia, internal/company documents, etc. It is similar to open-book exams, where students can access information in their books ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6qb0r5bzex4rfktkz9r5gr))
- In closed-book QA, the model responds to questions without being explicitly given a context because it has learned some information encoded into its parameters during training. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4ddgb4z50p27g5xapaehv9c))
- This model doesn’t extract answers from a context; it generates text directly to answer the question using language models such as GPT-3 and optionally takes a context. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6qc5k7dbgxax17g7ze3dnh))

- The reader model then takes in the most similar contexts and the question to provide a span selection of the answer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6rnk0zmja2htbsgg8zm7v7))
- We use this system to answer more abstract questions that don’t require exact answers. The system returns answers that are more suggestions or opinions, not direct. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6rn3ccfbj2hwa98y7gzjmk))
