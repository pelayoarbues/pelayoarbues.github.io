- I believe organizational design should be a key discipline in management. While all the talk about digital transformation typically revolves around technology, talent, culture… -all of them very relevant topics-, not so much attention has been paid to organizational structures. However, the org chart -with all its roles and reporting lines- is typically a very telling expression of the culture of a company, while leadership styles are often very conditioned by the structure that vertebrates an organization.

- At present, the most important capacity for any organization to succeed is its capacity to continuously learn and adapt to change. This requires a fluid communication within the organization that you can very hardly achieve under a hierarchical structure. At the same time, most of the challenges organizations face today are multidisciplinary in nature, making structures based on functional division badly equipped to meet these challenges.
