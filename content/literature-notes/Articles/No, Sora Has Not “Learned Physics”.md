## Highlights
- I disagree. Sora has not learned physics, and is not a reliable guide to how to the world works. It is at best a semi-reliable guide to how the world *looks*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr0cw1f1f1b7cvqnx0aqpmhf))
- These two—how the world *works*, and how the world *looks*—are fundamentally different. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr0cw675nbmnak8rag0k8nkz))
- A physics engine takes a list of objects and locations etc. and computes temporal updates, and allows you to render views.
  At the core is a bit of basic physics: the notion of object permanence, the fact that other things being equal objects tend to persist over time (even if e.g., they are occluded from some perspective) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr0cwty1zm9rsdkgbetefstt))
- Other videos feature chairs levitating, basketballs [passing through rims and exploding](https://youtu.be/m3Udry2fUnA?si=8WkpIEGQ7Jn73I7k), glasses leaping spontaneously into the air, people spontaneously changing size, etc, in what I earlier called [Sora’s Surreal Physics](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/soras-surreal-physics). No actual physics is ever modeled, and the entities depicted are not constrained by the laws of physics. They do as pixels do, not as collections of atoms must. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr0cx3yw41g4khv3a4tewm2m))
- Whenever there is a conflict between physics and image sequence prediction, image sequence prediction wins. The laws of physics are about objects, not pixels; Sora knows only about pixels and image spaces, not objects. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr0cxvdvy4w6bvkgc7zjxpd4))
