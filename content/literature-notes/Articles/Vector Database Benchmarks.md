## Highlights
- `Redis` took over 8 hours to complete with indexing the `deep-image-96-angular`. That’s why we interrupted the tests and didn’t include those results. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtc2az04hjg21254zbn6jt82))
- `Redis` does better than the others while using one thread only. When we just use a single thread, the bottleneck might be the client, not the server, where `Redis`’s custom protocol gives it an advantage. But it is architecturally limited to only a single thread execution, which makes it impossible to scale vertically. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtc2aqqahef2j3f7n3p012y6))
