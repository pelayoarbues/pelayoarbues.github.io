## Highlights
- Amsterdam real estate startup [Epum](https://www.epumdata.com/) has raised $1.6 million Pre-Seed funding. Epum’s tech turns any commercial real estate developer, investment manager, or lender into a geospatial data science company.
  Epum was founded by two former commercial real estate developers (Royden Cooper and Spencer Stieff), one ex-Adyen senior software engineer (Leonardo Costa), one ex-Globality senior data scientist (Tomasz Pietruszka), and one of the world’s preeminent researchers in the field of Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (Marvin Mc Cutchan), who has a PhD from the Vienna University of Technology. 
  Epum’s platform includes the largest real-time dataset of urban zoning and planning activity across the  United States.
  Based on this dataset and proprietary algorithms, the platform offers a powerful commercial real estate development site selection solution. It evaluates local demand drivers, zoning, ownership profiles, demographics, competitive supply, land area, topography, traffic data, and more to identify and support ideal acquisition opportunities.
  Epum is already working with two nationwide commercial real estate developers and one real estate private equity fund. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j5n42m5s1zqr04emk8q1rw9f))
