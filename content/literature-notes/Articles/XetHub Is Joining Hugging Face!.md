## Highlights
- We are super excited to officially announce that Hugging Face acquired XetHub ðŸ”¥
  XetHub is a Seattle-based company founded by Yucheng Low, Ajit Banerjee, Rajat Arya who previously worked at Apple where they built and scaled Appleâ€™s internal ML infrastructure. XetHubâ€™s mission is to enable software engineering best practices for AI development. XetHub has developed technologies to enable Git to scale to TB repositories and enable teams to explore, understand and work together on large evolving datasets and models.

- Finally, with large datasets and large models come challenges with collaboration. How do teams work together on large data, models and code? How do users understand how their data and models are evolving? We will be working to find better solutions to answer these questions.
