- In this paper, we study the adoption of a generative AI tool that provides conversational guidance
  for customer support agents.1 This is, to our knowledge, the first study of the impact of generative
  AI when deployed at scale in the workplace. We find that access to AI assistance increases the
  productivity of agents by 14 percent, as measured by the number of customer issues they are able to
  resolve per hour. In contrast to studies of prior waves of computerization, we find that these gains
  accrue disproportionately to less-experienced and lower-skill workers.2 We argue that this occurs
  because ML systems work by capturing and disseminating the patterns of behavior that characterize
  the most productive agents. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h149aq4xqnxt05mrp6ftb9vv))
- It monitors customer chats and provides agents with real-time suggestions for how
  to respond. It is designed to augment agents, who remain responsible for the conversation and are
  free to ignore its suggestions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h149bvwj8364j7799crtdrtv))
- AI assistance increases worker productivity, resulting in a 13.8 percent increase in the
  number of chats that an agent is able to successfully resolve per hour. This increase reflects shifts in
  three components of productivity: a decline in the time it takes to an agent to handle an individual
  chat, an increase in the number of chats that an agent is able to handle per hour (agents may handle
  multiple calls at once), and a small increase in the share of chats that are successfully resolved. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h149ce14hyy6dvnk269wq5fx))
- AI assistance disproportionately increases the performance less skilled and less experi-
  enced workers across all productivity measures we consider. In addition, we find that the AI tool
  helps newer agents move more quickly down the experience curve: treated agents with two months
  of tenure perform just as well as untreated agents with over six months of tenure ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h149csrmwh7c3js7p35kzy0e))
- We posit that
  high-skill workers may have less to gain from AI assistance precisely because AI recommendations
  capture the potentially tacit knowledge embodied in their own behaviors. Rather, low-skill workers
  are more likely to improve by incorporating these behaviors by adhering to AI suggestions. Consis-
  tent with this, we find few positive effects of AI access for the highest-skilled or most-experienced
  workers. Instead, using textual analysis, we find suggestive evidence that AI assistance leads lower-
  skill agents to communicate more like high-skill agents. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h149d91z5afkjqcm1w6s5fyn))
- We show that AI assistance markedly improves how customers treat agents, as measured
  by the sentiments of their chat messages ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h149dk4zshep1zn9f82ey57k))
