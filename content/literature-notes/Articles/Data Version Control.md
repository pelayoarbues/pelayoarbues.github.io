## Highlights
- Versioning **GBs of datasets** is practically impossible with GitHub because it imposes an upper limit on the file size we can push to its remote repositories. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j04ee543sfj6jccqecph4xej))

- To help you skill up to build and deliver large data projects, we covered this in a dedicated deep dive here: **[You Cannot Build Large Data Projects Until You Learn Data Version Control!](https://www.dailydoseofds.com/you-cannot-build-large-data-projects-until-you-learn-data-version-control/)** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j04eebsgt82cqjwajwsa6yc6))
- This 32-minute deep dive will teach you everything you need to know about building 100% reproducible ML projects. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j04eee226gegh8nwhjeh0dn7))
- As we transition to real-world data projects, we need data version control. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j04eejv0a9s0wcxgr53q60hm))
