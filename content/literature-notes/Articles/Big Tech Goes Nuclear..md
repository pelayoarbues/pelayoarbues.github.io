## Highlights
- Amazon’s cloud computing arm announced Wednesday plans to invest millions in nuclear power projects. And it’s not alone. [Google announced a nuclear deal](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-kairos-power-nuclear-energy-agreement/) earlier this week, and Microsoft said last month it would help bring the [decommissioned Three Mile Island nuclear plant back online.](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/nx-s1-5120581/three-mile-island-nuclear-power-plant-microsoft-ai) As one portfolio manager told CBS, Big Tech and nuclear energy could be a [“marriage made in heaven.”](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-nuclear-reactor-investment-google-kairos-power/) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxgxz74rzqq8vcvn8h7tw1n))
- **Why?** These companies need more electricity for their power-guzzling artificial intelligence data centers. The Electric Power Research Institute estimates that by 2030, [data centers could consume up to 9% of the electricity America generates](https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/clean-energy-resources-meet-data-center-electricity-demand#op3) on an annual basis, up from 4% in 2023.

- **Interest in nuclear power is up, but don’t look at the receipts.** At the 2023 World Climate Action Summit, 25 countries, including the United States, pledged to [triple nuclear energy production by 2050](https://www.energy.gov/articles/cop28-countries-launch-declaration-triple-nuclear-energy-capacity-2050-recognizing-key) in order to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But few states or utility companies risk investing in new nuclear projects, because the costs are too damn high. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxgym8998ejtv5g2d6gnjrv))
- **Can next-generation reactors drive down costs**? [Small modular reactors, SMRs,](https://inl.gov/trending-topics/small-modular-reactors/) take up less space, are quicker to construct and can be placed closer to electric grids compared to previous generations of reactors. That, in theory, should make them cheaper to build, but we don’t yet have any precedence. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission [certified the first commercial modular reactor design](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nrc-certifies-first-us-small-modular-reactor-design) last year for a project that would have generated 462 megawatts of power in Utah. Then, [the project fizzled due to cost overruns.](https://www.eenews.net/articles/nuscale-cancels-first-of-a-kind-nuclear-project-as-costs-surge/) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxgzb51zk4h8wepqz15fs93))
- Spotify has been flooded with AI-generated music. Dubious record labels have been uploading [hundreds of fabricated albums en masse to the streaming platform](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/spotify-criticized-for-letting-fake-albums-appear-on-real-artist-pages/?comments-page=1#comments) this fall, Ars Technica reported, including some that ended up on real artists’ pages. In many cases, those albums are still up, and there’s no easy way for users or musicians to report the fakes. Who is listening to those fakes? It’s not just unsuspecting listeners who get served the albums via the algorithm. [Bots are now listening to bot-created music](https://www.wired.com/story/spotify-ai-music-robot-listeners/), which distorts what gets recommended to human listeners and diverts royalty payments from the artists they mimic. All this AI slop further erodes the user experience of Spotify. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaxh0e4n131yag2agz4147dn))
- Glenn McDonald, a former Spotify data analyst, told Ars Technica that it’s hard to get rich off streaming fraud because of paltry per-stream royalties. So the only way to make a decent buck is to flood the platform. [Breaking free of the algorithm](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/16/1096276/spotify-algorithms-music-discovery-ux/) altogether may be the only alternative to actually discovering new music sans bots (and to stop getting [repeatedly served the same Sabrina Carpenter song](https://www.vox.com/culture/357907/spotify-sabrina-carpenter-espresso-chappell-roan-algorithm)).
