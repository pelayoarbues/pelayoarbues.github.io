## Highlights
- In the same way the automobile granted us personal freedom to explore, **Local III** starts our journey towards a new freedom — personal, private access to machine intelligence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j12ptqf56tnmex6qgq67w31y))
- Developed by over 100 contributors spanning every timezone, this update includes an easy-to-use local model explorer, deep integrations with inference engines like `Ollama`, custom profiles for open models like `Llama3`, `Moondream`, and `Codestral`, and a suite of settings to make offline code interpretation more reliable.

- Local III also introduces a free, hosted, opt-in model via `interpreter --model i`. Conversations with the `i` model will be used to train our own open-source language model for computer control. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j12pv9gk3hjp2dh8pnjd67m0))
- Local III also introduces a free language model endpoint serving Llama3-70B. This endpoint provides users with a setup-free experience while contributing to the training of a small, locally running language model. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j12pvs1czh2fhzk9at455k51))
- Where `model` is a model from Ollama's [model library](https://ollama.com/library). This unified command abstracts away all model setup commands. It will only download the model if you haven't downloaded it before. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j12pwcx81ae9ves6wmyx25q2))
- Images sent to local models are rendered as a description of the image generated by [Moondream](https://moondream.ai/), a tiny vision model. The model also receives OCR extracted from the image. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j12pwj5yfgkpe2gx1y3xwksd))
- If this revolution is to broadly distribute its benefits, it must belong to the people. In classical computing, society transitioned away from the *mainframe* era of access to build the *personal computer*. This helped ensure a destiny for computers which we could control. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j12pwte36zqtca0n0gae2tth))
- Now, an oligopoly of language model providers stand to control the intelligence age. Open Interpreter is a balancing force against that. Our community is rapidly developing a response to ensure our collective freedom— private, local access to powerful AI agents.
