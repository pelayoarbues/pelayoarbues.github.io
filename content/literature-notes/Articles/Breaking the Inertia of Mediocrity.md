## Highlights
- It's rarely the terrible decisions, processes, or even people that'll sink your organization. It's the accumulation and inertia of the mediocre ones. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3h4xq11kr221ac92t0mq63j))
- The insidious nature of inertia is in its ability to compound the cost of action as time goes on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3h4xvs2s8heqpgfrkczweyg))
- Every additional month you let mediocrity fester, you make it harder to undo. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3h4y2x580newn8hnmdrr60w))
- Because hitting undo usually means at least one difficult conversation, some amount of disappointment, and a recognition that you get this one wrong. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3h4yhtz979y79fw9cbqasw2))
- Come up with excuses of why it just hasn't worked *yet*. Why just a bit more time is needed to turn it around. Any argument will do, as long as it postpones the requirement to move. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3h4zpg26gh6x7aaxbsqftkc))
- We usually know what needs to be done, but we shrink from the responsibility to do it. Unless occasion calls upon us without a choice, we'll find a way around. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3h57bzwkscvbqc9yh0t4vy6))
- Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life. Make the hard choices. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3h570zjvxzpst2m88vtydga))
