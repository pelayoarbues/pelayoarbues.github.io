## Highlights
- In [*The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486290735/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0486290735&linkId=0e8574e5657752f469c451be73a1e00a), we find a list of thirteen virtues that “occurr’d to me as necessary or desirable.”
  These names of virtues, with their precepts, were:
  1. TEMPERANCE. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation. 
  2. SILENCE. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation. 
  3. ORDER. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time. 
  4. RESOLUTION. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve. 
  5. FRUGALITY. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing. 
  6. INDUSTRY. Lose no time; be always employ’d in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions. 
  7. SINCERITY. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly. 
  8. JUSTICE. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty. 
  9. MODERATION. Avoid extreams; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve. 
  10. CLEANLINESS. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation. 
  11. TRANQUILLITY. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable. 
  12. CHASTITY. Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dulness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another’s peace or reputation. 
  13. HUMILITY. Imitate Jesus and Socrates. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz0fkfp4xaksp04hh9hq1rxv))
- My intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues, I judg’d it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the whole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and, when I should be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on, till I should have gone thro’ the thirteen; and, as the previous acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others, I arrang’d them with that view, as they stand above. Temperance first, as it tends to procure that coolness and clearness of head, which is so necessary where constant vigilance was to be kept up, and guard maintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient habits, and the force of perpetual temptations. This being acquir’d and establish’d, Silence would be more easy; and my desire being to gain knowledge at the same time that I improv’d in virtue, and considering that in conversation it was obtain’d rather by the use of the ears than of the tongue, and therefore wishing to break a habit I was getting into of prattling, punning, and joking, which only made me acceptable to trifling company, I gave Silence the second place.
