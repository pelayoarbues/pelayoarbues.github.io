## Highlights
- Companies, especially those claiming to be technology companies, cannot afford to spend too long looking at innovation. Therefore, the implementation of AI/ML technologies has turned into a kind of competition: whoever was the first to understand exactly how this will help speed up or optimize work, reduce costs and improve user experience will be the leader. Therefore, for companies engaged in online trading and providing services, such as classifieds, marketplaces or banks, the introduction of artificial intelligence is already a top priority.

- Artificial intelligence has been called the “universal equalizer.” Judging by research, it gives stronger employees a 15% increase in productivity, and weaker ones - 30%. The same thing happens with companies. Large and successful market leaders and new startups now seem to be equal in capabilities, which means that competition has instantly intensified, and no one can simply rest on their laurels.

- AI/ML technologies give to classifieds to significantly improve their work? One use case is filling out announcement cards. Such solutions are already being tested, for example, on the AliExpress marketplace, where artificial intelligence, when the seller fills out a product card, offers the best options for title and description. For people putting their apartment up for sale, creating a clear description is not always easy. Artificial intelligence can help with this or even take over this work entirely. In the future, it will probably be enough for Qian users to enter the address of their property and upload photos; the AI ​​will do the rest itself, highlighting the main advantages and parameters for buyers.

- The capabilities of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms can also be useful to realtors. For example, with the same filling of ads, of which they have to create a lot more. Optimizing the process will allow you to get rid of routine, and not only that associated with writing advertisements. The lion's share of a realtor's time is occupied by calls, conversations, arrangements for viewings, and planning meetings. An AI-based assistant can do all this instead: answer typical questions about the apartment, find free time through the calendar to organize a viewing, and notify the property owner and potential buyer about this. And, of course, all or almost all work with documents. Formation of an agreement, sending requests to the bank or all documentation for registering a transaction - all this can be delegated to AI.

- Creating a contract, like any other document, no longer requires special human participation if we are talking about a template. But each apartment, as a rule, has many “bottlenecks” that must be taken into account in the contract: heirs, lack of ownership documents, debts or rights of third parties. Such subtle nuances go beyond a simple template, and to correctly display them in the contract and in the transaction as a whole, you can involve not only a lawyer, but also solve them using artificial intelligence.

- The introduction of artificial intelligence into the work of Classified can help relieve not only the pain of users, but also the platforms themselves. User safety and protecting them from scammers is one of our priorities. The use of predictive models that take into account account history and user behavior patterns allows you to identify fraudsters much faster and more efficiently than manually. Now this happens already in the first minutes of appearance on the site, that is, even before the first contact with users is made. In this way, we minimize the risks from fraudsters and provide a safe user journey. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hy38r9ak2bwhh55zce2fmwth))
- Also, one of the key problems for all advertisement portals has been unreliable advertisements, the so-called “lanterns,” for many years. They are used for lead generation. When a call is received regarding such advertisements with the most attractive conditions, a good property and a price below the market, the realtor informs the buyer that the property has already been purchased and redirects him to an actual apartment. Using AI, we have learned to automatically identify 80% of unreliable ads before they are reported. To identify such objects, we analyze the correspondence of the description to the entered address, photographs of the object and ad parameters to the description; we can convert call recordings into text and use a test model to catch suspicious signals. Thanks to the work of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, we are able to ensure high quality content and minimize the number of unreliable objects. According to this indicator, we are 30% better than other classified companies, and in the capital regions - twice as good.

- The introduction of systems built on the basis of artificial intelligence will allow for automatic moderation of ads. In the future, it can evaluate the ad’s compliance with reality. The use of AI in such processes can significantly reduce operating costs: in our processes we are talking about tens of millions per year.
