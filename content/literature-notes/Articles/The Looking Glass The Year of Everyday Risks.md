## Highlights
- But alive is more than that.
  *Aliveness* is a quality of being. Its opposite is *dullness* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq0ryp1jc7pjwwrfd1vq0m7k))
- Dullness in taste is when food becomes a habit—reaching for a snack when you’re procrastinating; stuffing yourself because you seek comfort; booking fancy reservations because you’re the kind of person that does that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq0rz53zb4q9zfhy5e75xh6w))
- Dullness in physicality is when your body feels like a dungeon. You complain of the ways it lets you down—the aches, the limitations, the way it sags in the unblinking gaze of the mirror. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq0rz2cnwcfnjjfat82tk68x))
- Dullness in relationships is obligation. When a work meeting, a family visit, a party invitation feels like something you *have* to do to prevent some greater chaos. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq0ryx4kep8ercq5jg9jay5d))
- Dullness in vision is when you gaze out the window and there is nothing beautiful to see; gray clouds or ugly machines, the despair of Mother Nature or the flawed creations of human hands. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq0ryw068np82hpcx4yd78kq))
- *Aliveness* is flavor and fluidity, life and loss.
  Aliveness is not just joy, but also its polar opposite, sadness. Aliveness is accepting the risk of both.
  Aliveness is the subtle boundary between *longing* and *impatience*.
  Aliveness is risk, not comfort.
  Aliveness is the amplitude of emotion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq0rzh1ay15kknmdt4m9x1s3))
- Everyday risks — the small actions that come with a twinge of discomfort.
  Because of that twinge of discomfort, I haven’t jumped to do them. And so they continue to remain a notion in my mind, rejected for being too silly, stupid, effortful, fraught, impractical, ego-bruising, exposing. They remain untried ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq0s087ey30q97nmhz3jhr05))
- Everyday risks, like:
  …Apologizing when I didn’t want it to be my fault.
  …Sharing that raw feedback with my mom.
  …Asking a colleague I haven’t seen in years for a favor.
  …Saying no when I don’t want to disappoint.
  …Spilling the messy truth instead of controlling the narrative.
  …Trying on that new outfit I bought on a whim and later worried made me look stupid.
  …Calling instead of texting.
  …Sitting with the awkward pause.
  Everyday risks are not about the action in of itself; they are about the *feeling*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq0s205q3c5wsr90pkt5g1tc))
