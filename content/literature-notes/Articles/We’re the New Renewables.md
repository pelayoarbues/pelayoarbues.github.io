## Highlights
- Nvidia says it has found a way to speed up a computation-limited step in the chipmaking process so that it happens 40 times as fast as today’s standard. Called inverse lithography ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwmshjsnjfa8bkdz152n8dm5))
- As chipmaking required finer and finer features, engineers had to produce more and more complex designs to project those features onto the silicon. Inverse lithography (ILT) is the latest development. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwmvhghmh2gevxmcbhj49qje))
