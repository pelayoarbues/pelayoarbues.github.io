## Highlights
- *within a large company, it’s more effective to capture existing capacity than to create new capacity*, *but the opposite is true in startup and growth companies*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsjcdzc8nxzw1bwknepg5g7))
- • If you need more headcount, then convince leadership to require every team to send a volunteer to work on your project
  • If you’re missing a key leader, oblige a leader on a peer team to move to yours
  • Hiring is slow and restrictive, bypass that by recruiting internally instead ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsjem8bkr4nbamww451r6t0))
- whereas large companies anticipate a meaningful fraction of projects will fail, growth and startup companies depend on almost all projects succeeding. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsjg1hb14xge8n3yxxpytxs))
