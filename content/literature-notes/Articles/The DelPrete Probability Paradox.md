## Highlights
- There is an inverse correlation between how likely something is to occur and how much attention it gets – a phenomenon a friend has dubbed the *DelPrete Probability Paradox*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s3j8crsddk7hghhnw87xdt))
- **Why it matters**: This leads to attention being focused on the highly exciting, yet least likely scenarios, which dilutes focus and clarity while creating noise and distraction. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s3je0vcbx1dtjf43wynkqj))
- **Real estate is rife with possibility** – news headlines and conference agendas are packed with topics that exist in the realm of the *possible* and *plausible*, but not necessarily *probable*.
  • Will AI replace agents? What will happen to interest rates? How will the commission lawsuits change the industry? 
  • The reality is that no one knows, and the most *probable* outcomes are slow, incremental deviations from the current state, not radical changes.

- **Probability revolves** around the existence of data, facts, and evidence – the more we know, the more certain the predictions.
  • The least likely events – *the possible* – generally exist in a reality light on facts and flush with speculation. 
  • Facts are important; they form a trajectory of likeliness – plotting them over time and triangulating data points can identify likely outcomes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s3kwg34vx5wety2w1yngsb))
- **Inertia rules**: Newton’s First Law states that an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside force – in other words, systems tend to remain constant.
  • Consider the percentage of homeowners that use a real estate agent to sell their home: even after the introduction of Zillow, Opendoor, and billions of dollars in venture capital pushing alternative models, it remains at a 40 year high.
