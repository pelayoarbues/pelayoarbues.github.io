## Highlights
- Generative artificial intelligence is transforming the world and the workplace, but there is a big disconnect between employers and employees. While CEOs recognize its potential and many already are redesigning work to streamline operations or gain a competitive advantage, they underestimate what’s required to achieve the productivity improvements. The swift adoption has left many employees with inadequate skills and worsening morale. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnr82ekpj8v9svg28j2sjnxg))
- Generative AI has existed for decades, but the introduction in late 2022 of ChatGPT dramatically accelerated its adoption. More than 50% of workers now use it at least weekly, and 15% use it daily, according to a [new report on generative AI by the Oliver Wyman Forum](https://www.oliverwymanforum.com/global-consumer-sentiment/how-will-ai-affect-global-economics.html). Uptake was especially strong in the second half of 2023. Depending on the industry, employee use jumped to a range of approximately 35% to 75% in November from 10% to 60% in June.

- The growth occurred so quickly that many companies haven’t yet provided much-needed guardrails, and many employees don’t know how to optimize queries, identify bias, or check for plagiarism. The result: increased risk, misuse, and growing anxiety. Some 84% of workers who use generative AI said they have exposed their company’s data via public generative AI tools in the last three months, according to the report. Over 40% said they have seen incorrect generative AI outputs, and almost 10% have used the technology behind their employer’s back.

- One reason for the frequent misuse is that many companies expected their employees to teach themselves. There’s also a disconnect between worker expectations and what leaders think. Almost all the employees we surveyed – 98% of them – said they would need additional training within the next five years due to generative AI, a view shared by only 40% of CEOs, according to IBM.

- Almost a third of workers already are pursing learning opportunities in response to AI disruption, but more than half said the company training was inadequate. Most want more upskilling directly from employers, including 80% of white-collar workers, 76% of blue collars, and 74% of pink collars.

- Leaders need to acknowledge and address employee anxiety about job security or risk discord and talent loss. The World Economic Forum estimates the technology will impact almost a quarter of global jobs in the next five years, adding 69 million while eliminating 83 million. Already, 60% of employees fear that generative AI could make their jobs obsolete. That concern is much greater among those who report that their employers provided guidelines on the technology.

- Companies are more likely to retain talent if they communicate clearly and regularly about how generative AI can benefit both the individual worker and the organization. Leaders also should prioritize the work and not the technology by identifying specific tasks where generative AI can create improvements. When looking for efficiency, a good place to start is with highly repetitive, rules-based tasks. Getting generative AI to do that work could free up employee time for more creative and thoughtful work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnr849qn725j3pc0emxb8dyz))
- Finding quick wins for the employee and organization is critical as some of the longer-term productivity and other benefits will not be seen for years – and employees will still have to test, learn, and stay engaged during this period. Getting their feedback and leading with empathy can enable everyone to understand how generative AI can help individuals and the company be more successful.
