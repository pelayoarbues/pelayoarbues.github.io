- Historically, every new technology that matters, from electric lighting to automobiles to radio to the Internet, has sparked a *moral panic* – a [social contagion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic) that convinces people the new technology is going to destroy the world, or society, or both. The fine folks at [Pessimists Archive](https://pessimistsarchive.org/) have documented these technology-driven moral panics over the decades; their history makes the pattern vividly clear. It turns out this present panic is [not even the first for AI](https://newsletter.pessimistsarchive.org/p/the-original-ai-doomer-dr-norbert). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jwch1qx173g1fnre9tdv9f))
- Economists have observed a [longstanding pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootleggers_and_Baptists) in reform movements of this kind. The actors within movements like these fall into two categories – “Baptists” and “Bootleggers” – drawing on the historical example of the [prohibition of alcohol in the United States in the 1920’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States):
  • “Baptists” are the true believer social reformers who legitimately feel – deeply and emotionally, if not rationally – that new restrictions, regulations, and laws are required to prevent societal disaster. For alcohol prohibition, these actors were often literally [devout Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Nation) who felt that alcohol was destroying the moral fabric of society. For AI risk, these actors are true believers that AI presents one or another existential risks – strap them to a polygraph, they really mean it.
  • “Bootleggers” are the self-interested opportunists who stand to financially profit by the imposition of new restrictions, regulations, and laws that insulate them from competitors. For alcohol prohibition, these were the [literal bootleggers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Bootleggers) who made a fortune selling illicit alcohol to Americans when legitimate alcohol sales were banned. For AI risk, these are CEOs who stand to make more money if regulatory barriers are erected that form a cartel of government-blessed AI vendors protected from new startup and open source competition – the software version of “too big to fail” banks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jwggcc5rqrqkpz1barj6ep))
- A cynic would suggest that some of the apparent Baptists are also Bootleggers – specifically the ones paid to attack AI by their [universities](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/new-report-assesses-progress-and-risks-artificial-intelligence), [think tanks](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2023/05/22/the-us-government-should-regulate-ai/), [activist groups](https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/the-ai-dilemma), and [media outlets](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/05/26/ai-regulation-congress-risk/). If you are [paid a salary](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/582565917) or [receive grants](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/grant-announcement/) to foster AI panic…you are probably a Bootlegger. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jwh67gv85v2t1dw5xdhyaz))
- The problem with the Bootleggers is that they *win*. The Baptists are naive ideologues, the Bootleggers are cynical operators, and so the result of reform movements like these is often that the Bootleggers get what they want – regulatory capture, insulation from competition, the formation of a cartel – and the Baptists are left wondering where their drive for social improvement went so wrong. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jwhgfxdd0c0e71r1ebeytn))
- We just lived through a stunning example of this – banking reform after the 2008 global financial crisis. The Baptists told us that we needed new laws and regulations to break up the “too big to fail” banks to prevent such a crisis from ever happening again. So Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which was marketed as satisfying the Baptists’ goal, but in reality was coopted by the Bootleggers – the big banks. The result is that the same banks that were “too big to fail” in 2008 are *much, much larger* now. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jwj2m6q9qymazbhhvv6a90))
- So in practice, even when the Baptists are genuine – and even when the Baptists are *right* – they are used as cover by manipulative and venal Bootleggers to benefit themselves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jwj7638se8dqqgf8f9ccwa))
- The fear that technology of our own creation will rise up and destroy us is deeply coded into our culture. The Greeks expressed this fear in the Prometheus Myth – Prometheus brought the destructive power of fire, and more generally technology (“techne”), to man, for which Prometheus was condemned to perpetual torture by the gods. Later, Mary Shelley gave us moderns our own version of this myth in her novel *Frankenstein, or, The Modern Prometheus*, in which we develop the technology for eternal life, which then rises up and seeks to destroy us. And of course, no AI panic newspaper story is complete without a still image of a gleaming red-eyed killer robot from James Cameron’s *Terminator* films. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jx7x78zty0cemg6vznw6wb))
- The presumed evolutionary purpose of this mythology is to motivate us to seriously consider potential risks of new technologies – fire, after all, can indeed be used to burn down entire cities. But just as fire was also the foundation of modern civilization as used to keep us warm and safe in a cold and hostile world, this mythology ignores the far greater upside of most – all? – new technologies, and in practice inflames destructive emotion rather than reasoned analysis. Just because premodern man freaked out like this doesn’t mean we have to; we can apply rationality instead. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9jx8yk8neyfqnfgghff9b2n))
