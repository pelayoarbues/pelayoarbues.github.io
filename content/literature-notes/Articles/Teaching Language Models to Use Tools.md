## Highlights
- Giving an LLM access to an external tool is a reliable way to solve some of the limitations that these models face. However, LLMs will not know how to use tools naturally, which raises the question: *How do we teach our model to leverage external tools* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1mh1y1yhdrp8hbwaws3xpqz))
- Teaching an LLM to leverage tools is no different than learning how to solve any other task with an LLM. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1mh2937g0mrmaq7z56x0yvh))
- **pre-training.** The first and most basic form of learning for LLMs is pre-training. During pre-training, the model is trained over a large corpus of unlabeled textual data using a [language modeling objective](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/i/85568430/language-modeling) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1mh2t7z7ssqdzk4za9debga))
