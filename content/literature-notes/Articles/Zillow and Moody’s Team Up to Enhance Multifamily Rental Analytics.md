## Highlights
- Zillow’s multifamily rental partners will soon gain access to enhanced reports and analytics, powered by Moody’s comprehensive data and CRE solutions. These insights will empower our partners to optimize their pricing strategies and analyze local economic and demographic trends to help them reduce downtime between leases. 
  Starting in July, Zillow will provide rental partners utilizing any of our multifamily advertising packages with a new market report featuring local real estate trends, including rent, vacancy and inventory data for each property based on location. The market reports will automatically be in eligible partners’ Zillow Rentals Ad Manager (ZRAM) accounts. This initial report marks the beginning of ongoing enhancements, with future offerings expected to provide even more detailed insights later this year.

- Beginning this summer, Moody’s CRE offerings will leverage Zillow’s multifamily rental property database to enhance its already expansive market rent and vacancy data tracked across the U.S. This partnership provides greater insights and improved data analyses, offering enhanced value to Moody’s customers. 
  “We are excited to bring Moody’s CRE trusted market knowledge and insights to Zillow’s expansive audience, especially within the multifamily rental space,” said Luis Amador, general manager of commercial real estate at Moody’s. “By integrating Zillow’s extensive multifamily rental property data into our CRE data platform, we are not only enhancing the breadth and depth of our market rent and vacancy data but also elevating the value we deliver to our diverse customer base of investors, lenders and brokers. Additionally, this collaboration equips Zillow clients with the robust market intelligence they need to confidently navigate the complexities of the real estate market.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j28vdfj3gfkgj6jjc28zybbh))
