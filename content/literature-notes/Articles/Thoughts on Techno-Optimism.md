## Highlights
- Positive techno-optimism is basically the opposite of *stagnationism*. In recent years, a number of thinkers have [started to say](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-American-Growth-Princeton/dp/0691147728) that humanity has basically picked the low-hanging fruit of what the Universe can do, and that future innovation will [get a lot more expensive](https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf) — or even slow to a trickle. Positive techno-optimism says that no, there’s still a lot of low-hanging fruit, and relative to our total GDP it’s still not that expensive to find it.

- Normative techno-optimism is different. It says that more technology will make the world a better place for humanity. In fact, this kind of techno-optimism is surprisingly rare — even some of my favorite science fiction stories are implicitly or explicitly built around the idea that no matter how our capabilities improve, humans’ fundamental brutish nature will never change. As far as I can tell, this very prevalent attitude comes from the World Wars in the 20th century, in which the industrial technologies that were deployed to improve living standards before 1914 were turned to destructive purposes. There are a few people who argue that more technology makes us better people — Steve Pinker made this argument in *[The Better Angels of Our Nature](https://www.amazon.com/Better-Angels-Our-Nature-Violence/dp/0143122010)*, and I think it’s the implicit premise of [Lois McMaster Bujold’s science fiction](https://www.amazon.com/Barrayar-Vorkosigan-Saga-McMaster-Bujold-ebook/dp/B005BFIH7M/ref=sr_1_1?crid=MX3BSKOH04L2&keywords=barrayar&qid=1697823068&s=books&sprefix=barraya%2Cstripbooks%2C149&sr=1-1).
