## Highlights
- Feature scaling is commonly used to improve the performance and stability of ML models. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnr61em7z4jxvppt1qrsg930))
- This is because it scales the data to a standard range. This prevents a specific feature from having a strong influence on the model’s output. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnr61hjvb0c9rpdxr3vdsz84))
- For instance, in the image above, the scale of **income** could massively impact the overall prediction. Scaling both features to the same range can mitigate this and improve the model’s performance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnr61wvssng1g17gg1qdy55b))
- In my opinion, while feature scaling is often crucial, we often overlook whether it is even needed or not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnr629dqq7yq67j87krwpwkp))
- But as counterintuitive as it may sound, **the first step towards imputing missing data should NEVER be imputation.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnr63fbcp1jhee5qhkgsybkp))
