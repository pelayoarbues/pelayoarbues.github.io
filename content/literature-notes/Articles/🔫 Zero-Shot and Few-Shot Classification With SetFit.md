## Highlights
- The code below will load the [banking customer requests dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/banking77) from the Hub, encode the `text` field, and create the `vectors` field which will contain only one key (`mini-lm-sentence-transformers`). For the purposes of labelling the dataset from scratch, it will also remove the `label` field, which contains the original intent labels.

- SetFit’s approach to zero-shot is to create a synthetic dataset of training examples, which is different from other approaches (e.g., transformers zero-shot pipelines) where “templated” examples with label names are used at inference time.
