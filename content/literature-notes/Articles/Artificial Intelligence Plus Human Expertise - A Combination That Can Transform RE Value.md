## Highlights
- **Business plans and portfolio values at a click**
  The value of a property is derived from its use or – from the owner’s perspective – from the underlying business plan. Wüest Dimensions provides this automatically. While hedonic rent equations determine the current and future rent level, operating costs and vacancy trends are forecasted using machine learning. The entire business plan is then checked for its intrinsic value using integrated discount rate models and compared with alternative scenarios. In this way, the most valuable measures are made visible immediately.
  The business plans of the individual properties can be aggregated across the entire portfolio. This allows the long-term capital requirement or surplus to be shown. Based on this data, investment applications can be created automatically which, in addition to business plans, investment requirements and CO2 reduction path, also show the positioning on the market and the necessary benchmarks. An automatically generated ESG rating is also included and can help achieve a better GRESB rating (recognized by GRESB).
  Comprehensive market and location data are also part of Wüest Dimensions. They enable an overarching and in-depth understanding of local market conditions, socio-economic trends and environmental factors. This not only helps to mitigate risks and identify opportunities, but also to predict future developments and thus prevent a negative impact on the value of the portfolio and its assets.
