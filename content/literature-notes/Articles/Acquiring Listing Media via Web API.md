## Highlights
- The challenge is that there are many ways to describe interior and exterior elements of a property or even the type of property itself.

- Agents will use market-specific phrases to describe property details. That complexity has to be turned into something usable at scale.
  • How do you decide what to show?
  • How do you retrieve the details you want to use?
  • How much customization is required between markets?
  • How much work is required by the agent?
  • How can we leverage AI?

- ****Standards to the Rescue****Standards help add structure to data in a way that is easy to use and can traverse different geographies.
  Leveraging AI technology, products can turn visuals into adaptable data that works across markets.
  By combining AI with standards, a list of specific details can be created and used across different properties and markets and, most important for this exercise, for marketing.
  Some marketing prompts that are well supported in the Data Dictionary include:
  • Architectural Style
  • Room/Interior Descriptions
  • Room Sizes
  • Location
  • Lot Size
  When fed into an AI engine, photo elements can be broken down into a text format that can be carried through to a text-to-speech audio file. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hthfzsnxf9sn1wwp9r0jnxa0))
