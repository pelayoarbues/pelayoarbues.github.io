## Highlights
- Before we jump into the fine-tuning process, let’s take a moment to appreciate the capabilities of this amazing model.
  • ***Open Source:*** This means it’s freely available for everyone to use and modify, fostering innovation and collaboration within the AI community.
  • ***Compact Size:*** Unlike many large language models (LLMs) that require massive computing resources, Qwen-2 VL is surprisingly compact, making it accessible for individuals and smaller teams with limited resources.
  • ***Multimodality:*** The ability to work with both text and images allows Qwen-2 VL to tackle a variety of tasks, from image captioning to visual question answering. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j8hy1nmf9dhn9ejndjz6pst0))
- Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task. This is crucial for enhancing the model’s performance and achieving optimal results. LlamaFactory simplifies this process with its user-friendly interface and powerful functionalities.
  LlamaFactory is like having a toolbox full of AI magic tools that let you:
  • Fine-tune various AI models: From LLMs to multimodality models like Qwen-2 VL.
  • Use a “low-code” or “no-code” approach: Meaning you don’t have to be a coding expert to get started.
  • Customize models for specific tasks: Train your model for image captioning, text summarization, or any other task you can dream up. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j8hy1sjtcypychx2xnn6yb3w))
- Now, let’s explore the two main ways to fine-tune your Qwen-2 VL model with LlamaFactory:
  1. ***LlamaBoard: The No-Code Approach***
  LlamaBoard is a visual, user-friendly interface that lets you fine-tune models without writing a single line of code. It’s perfect for beginners and those who prefer a more intuitive approach.
  2. ***LlamaFactory CLI: Command-Line Flexibility***
  LlamaFactory CLI offers greater flexibility and control over the fine-tuning process through command-line commands. This is ideal for experienced users who want to experiment with various parameters and settings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j8hy1zxb6srr4xkqgxqwzn5t))
- 1. Create a Configuration File (JSON):
  Start by creating a JSON file that outlines the parameters for your fine-tuning process. This includes things like the model you’re using, the data sets, and the desired training settings.
  2. Launch the Fine-Tuning Process:
  Use the `llama_factory train` command, passing the path to your JSON configuration file.
  3. Monitor the Training:
  Observe the output and progress of your fine-tuning process. This will give you insights into how your model is learning.
  4. Merge the Fine-Tuned Model:
  Once the training is complete, you can merge the fine-tuned model with the original model using the `merge_adapter` function provided in LlamaFactory.
  5. Test and Deploy:
  Finally, evaluate the performance of your fine-tuned model and deploy it for use in your applications. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j8hy2g6skv4pj1xpgtrqxakc))
