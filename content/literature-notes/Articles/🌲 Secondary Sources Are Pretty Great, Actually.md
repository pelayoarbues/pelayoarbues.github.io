- Full Title: 🌲 Secondary Sources Are Pretty Great, Actually

## Highlights
- Conventional wisdom says that primary sources — which is to say, first-hand accounts, genuine artifacts of the ‘physical evidence’ type, and hard data from original research — are ‘best.’ Frankly, this is a great example of a time when I disagree with conventional wisdom.

- Secondary sources are fantastic at distilling information, and while it is often useful to go back and confirm that a secondary source is in fact accurately representing a primary source, the fact of the matter is… a lot of the times laymen (and everyone is a layman in at least one field) do not have the expertise to evaluate that. Sometimes, the best way to confirm the reliability secondary source is to just read a lot of other secondary sources. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmb5t0wvm9dyg86kct5dcy33))
- For a variety of reasons, teachers in a schoolhouse setting often have a hard time teaching students how to evaluate the reliability of sources, *especially* the modern stuff. This should not surprise anyone; [teaching critical thinking is hard](https://substack.com/redirect/256d1641-39e5-4075-8502-2aec16d104d3?j=eyJ1IjoiMjIzYTgyIn0.sKvEWKdJVbfjtf9ATUi8jhInkgN0jta26RjThA3a2vg) and so is [teaching notetaking](https://substack.com/redirect/0d598147-ebd2-4d20-86af-2d80a1afac7c?j=eyJ1IjoiMjIzYTgyIn0.sKvEWKdJVbfjtf9ATUi8jhInkgN0jta26RjThA3a2vg). One reason source evaluation is tricky is that teachers must navigate the political waters of their district and parents can get pretty angry if teachers criticize their preferred news outlet. “Herotodus was the first historian but you can’t trust everything” is easy. “The Atlantic doesn’t typically outright lie but does occasionally shade the truth” can get you into trouble. Another is because we’re required to teach fine-grained distinctions between primary, secondary, and tertiary sources … but due to time and cognitive constraints it gets oversimplified down to “primary sources are best!” even though primary sources are harder to interpret without context. A third reason is because students doing formal research projects are highly incentivized to “play it safe” by sticking to obviously reliable sources and therefore get very few chances to learn by experimenting with edge cases, because then they might “fail” and failure has consequences; lost time, lost prestige, and shame, among others.
