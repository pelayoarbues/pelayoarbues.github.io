## Highlights
- It’s clear that founders Trey Holterman, Diego Baugh, and Tyler Johnson are craftsmen with a vision to redefine the status quo. In 2022, as LLMs took the world by storm, the market was trying to navigate the right way to build solutions on top of the many models becoming available. Trey kept the team focused and spent months obsessing over novel applications of new open source models. Diego designed and built an elegant product to make these applications practical and usable for non-technical teams. Tyler (who was the fastest promotion to engineering director at his previous firm) scaled the systems data pipelines so that training and inference could work at scalable economics for the average business. Together, they turned sophisticated ML research into differentiated, practical applications for non-technical business users.

- The result is a powerful horizontal product called Tennr, which is anchored around understanding unstructured inputs and doing the work that comes after. It can apply AI reasoning and decision-making to perform end-to-end workflows that are much more complex than what legacy solutions can support. Customers in healthcare, financial services, and logistics have been particularly successful using Tennr to perform processes they previously had to do manually.

- When we spoke to Tennr’s customers, it was clear we were observing a true step-function change in how organizations think about their workflows and processes. We’re quick to think of time and cost savings, but the impact is much larger. For example, one customer pointed out that the ability to automate processes around new customer onboarding is a revenue-accelerating outcome because it enables them to serve more customers. Another pointed out that their staff can now focus their time on higher-value work. We were hearing soundbites reflecting the true potential of process automation that actually works: business owners changing assumptions on their business models. As one customer put it, “We are salivating at the opportunities for what this means for our business.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ht10mhzqntzcbgaq8jqf9q3v))
