## Highlights
- seat time has come to refer to the skills and experience required for management, which can only be picked up by doing the job. No amount of reading or thinking can give you seat time. It’s purely experiential. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbc5v8f8t5jy31y843m547n))
- It’s easy to read about the need for clear feedback and nod along, but hard not to soften feedback to someone you like at the moment you’re giving it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbbv6pjj5850rzvg26b2ybj))
- It’s not that the emotional work of managing gets easier with seat time. You do get better at compartmentalizing and processing the emotional challenges of management. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbbvspr86eyp4g0w4menq7f))
- You can’t treat everyone like yourself, because not everyone on your team is like you! Most seat time lessons sound painfully obvious when you write them out like this. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbbwd70gpkpbhm8wctnjna7))
- A closely related lesson is that you can’t treat everyone the same way. It seems like it would be fair or even right to do this, but it’s not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbbx1h566tkf7gbft49x6v5))
- Coaching and growing your team is one of the most important duties of a manager. I couldn’t coach effectively until I learned to tailor my approach to each individual and what they needed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbbxj2v2e1s38jthzfjwqbf))
- One of your jobs as a manager is to build a network with other managers and teams to get things done. You must build relationships outside your team for your team to succeed. Management success is not about what you, personally, can do. It’s about what you can get done through and by others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbbyjt3emfcfr5932p0wza1))
- You can’t solve [problems bigger than your team](https://www.elidedbranches.com/2019/05/opp-other-peoples-problems.html) without a network of friends and allies within your company. It’s important to cultivate this network purposefully and intentionally. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbbywkb57fmnz2arfy2fghn))
- lot of my regrets my time as a manager come from situations where I should have asked for help and didn’t. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbbzsgqdz5c0pcneyd7sbkm))
