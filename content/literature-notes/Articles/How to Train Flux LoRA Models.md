## Highlights
- Tips for good training images:
  • The ideal size is 1024×1024. It is OK to use images with different sizes but be sure to include some close to 1024×1024.
  • Diversity is the key. You want your subject to be in different scenes, settings, and clothing. Otherwise, the model will be confused about what you are trying to train.
  • If you are training a face, include a few high-resolution headshots.
  • The default parameters work for 10 – 20 images. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j8n5n1wh01htzaq0d3wa1ks1))
