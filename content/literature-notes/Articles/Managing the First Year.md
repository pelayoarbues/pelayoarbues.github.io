- Document Note: When your team makes a mistake is often tempting to micromanage them and treat them as infants. The truth is that if you are surrounded by professionals is that they might need more context for doing a good job.
   Management is more creative as it seems, how to structure your team, how to design effective processes, always having an eye on people development and delivery levels.
   Management is a form of multiplying yourself and your very ultimate objective is to **make your team work well**.
   Management is hard and is more a craft than something you can learn. 
   Go to therapy to understand your inner tendencies and patterns. You have to deal with your fears and insecurities, you have the feeling of your technical skills degrade over time.
   # Management definition 
   For the author management is not a role, is a constellation of roles. The main difficulty, besides a calendar packed of meetings with different people and projects is to change hats from minute to minute:
   - People manager
   - Resource manager
   - Project manager
   - Communications manager
   - Process manager
   - Technical mentor and coach
   # Meetings are the main tool of a manager
   From 1-1 meetings, team meetings and project specific ones. 
   # Managers words carry a lot of power
   You are not a random member of your team anymore
   # Resource management is particularly hard
   # Mentoring is different for teaching
   Mentoring as manager is more coaching than teaching. Difficult to let people find the time to study and develop while keeping a high speed delivery service

- But it turned out management didn’t work like that. It turned out **management was a craft**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs3nt5xnn50rh719e9ycm8b6))
- Unlike data science, where learning more was the answer to a skills gap, my time spent in books didn’t seem to translate directly into being better at my job.
  As a manager, I found that it wasn’t knowledge I needed, it was the daily practice of doing the work. And in that, I was constantly bumping up against the limits of my bravery and patience ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs3ntpphzcx6wetgj6drmx9d))
