## Highlights
- Today we introduce [**RAGs**](https://github.com/run-llama/rags)**,** a Streamlit app that allows you to create and customize your own RAG pipeline and then use it over your own data — all with natural language! This means you can now setup a “ChatGPT over your data” without needing to code. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfsdvhz8c3kdac5rpb5armkz))
- • **View Generated Parameters:** The builder agent suggests parameters based on your initial setup.
  • **Edit and Customize**: You have complete freedom to tweak these settings, ensuring the RAG agent behaves exactly as you need.
  • **Update the Agent:** Any changes you make can be instantly applied by hitting the “Update Agent” button. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfsdw0qrwy3bc1v1hrwytze2))
- The final piece of the RAGs experience is the Generated RAG Agent section. Here’s what you can expect:
  • **Interactive Chatbot Interface:** Just like ChatGPT, engage in conversations with your RAG agent.
  • **Data-Driven Responses:** The agent utilizes top-k vector search and optional summarization tools to answer your queries based on the underlying data.
  • **Seamless Integration:** The agent dynamically picks the right tools to fulfill your queries, ensuring a smooth and intelligent interaction with your dataset. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfsdwvcn8gjxwg6ejxegtp7a))
