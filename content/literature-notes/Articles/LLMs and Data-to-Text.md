## Highlights
- Since then I’ve had lots of discussions with people, in both academic and commercial contexts, about whether it makes sense to use LLMs to generate texts that summarise data. Below I give a high-level summary of my current views on this topic. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h44as8z52c38qmrb4tpm5prb))
- The latest versions of GPT and LLMs have improved a bit, but they are still not very good at analytics and extracting insights from data. And perhaps we shouldn’t expect them to be good at analytics; after all, they are *language* models! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h44avc6hwqkx9kvzyckw3kc9))
- the best approach is to do analytics and insight creation separately (outside the LLM), and then provide these insights to the LLM as part of its input data ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h44avve23ge09hddqz8jj8w6))
- I think asking LLMs to do analytics fundamentally makes little sense, but its certainly possible that LLMs will get better at discourse-level issues and hence generate better long-form texts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h44cm665493hyempmts4d8gg))
- LLMs are very good at *microplanning* and *surface realisation*, at least in academic leaderboard contexts. However, there are some important caveat about real-world usage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h44cmnmkd5rpv4t7nga4c51h))
- LLMs currently don’t do nearly as well at *document planning*, but perhaps this will change over time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h44cmv9n6af59yx6cvxyta4n))
- LLMs are poor at *signal analysis* and *data interpretation*, and it is a mistake to expect them to do these tasks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h44cmx2fgf2ptgt0yry9cr7x))
- Of course in the real-world we don’t need to be purists and insist on 100% LLM solutions, we can build systems which use LLM technology where it makes sense and other technologies elsewhere. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h44cn57eq9z2z16tw3ja0c48))
