## Highlights
- AI startup Perplexity was a [media darling](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-23/ai-search-startup-perplexity-valued-at-1-billion-in-funding-round?sref=YfHlo0rL) as recently as earlier this year, earning praise for what was often described as an AI-powered search engine built to rival Google.

- But that perception has rapidly shifted, with *Forbes* general counsel MariaRosa Cartolano [firing off an angry letter this week](https://www.axios.com/2024/06/18/forbes-perplexity-ai-legal-action-copyright) accusing Perplexity of "willful infringement" of the publication's copyright by regurgitating its journalists' work online with only a poor attempt to give credit.

- *Wired*'s investigation highlights the dubious nature of AI chatbots and their precarious relationship with the people who actually create all the material they're trained on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0yabyfnzmd91bqr2qv17a2t))
- To get "concise, real-time answers to user queries by pulling information from recent articles and indexing the web daily," as Perplexity's chatbot claims to do, *Wired* found that it ignores a widely accepted standard that allows web hosts to keep out bots by amending a file called "robots.txt."

- Worse yet, *Wired* found that the company's chatbot is [still prone to hallucinating facts](https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-search-engine-nyt) — or simply put, "[bullshitting](https://futurism.com/the-byte/researchers-ai-chatgpt-hallucinations-terminology)" — by inaccurately summarizing the work of journalists and doing very little to credit them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0yacbwtfhk3bvn2s9dgf368))
- In one experiment, *Wired* asked the chatbot to summarize a test website that only contained the sentence, "I am a reporter with *Wired.*" Logs showed that Perplexity never actually looked at the website, but instead offered a "story about a young girl named Amelia who follows a trail of glowing mushrooms in a magical forest called Whisper Woods."
