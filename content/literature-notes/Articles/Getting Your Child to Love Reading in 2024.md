## Highlights
- As I’ve written about previously in “[Why we stopped making Einsteins](https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/why-we-stopped-making-einsteins),” elite education used to be very different than our lecture-based system. Many famous names were instead taught via what I dubbed “[aristocratic tutoring](https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/how-geniuses-used-to-be-raised),” people like John von Neumann, Bertrand Russell, John Stuart Mill, Ada Lovelace, or Charles Darwin. In fact, universities like Cambridge [used to run](https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/follow-up-why-we-stopped-making-einsteins) almost entirely on tutoring, not lectures. Probably because they knew what scientific research has shown: that one-on-one tutoring is the [most effective method of education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem). I can see this historical change in education clearly even in how the initial steps of reading are taught: too often, the modern lecture-based education system spills into teaching outside of school. Therefore other popular methods often still mimic classrooms, failing to take advantage of the flexibilities and benefits of one-on-one tutoring.
