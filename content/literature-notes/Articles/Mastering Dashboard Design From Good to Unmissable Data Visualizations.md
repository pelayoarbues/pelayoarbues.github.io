  Data Visualization & Dashboard Design Process by Seoyeon Jun (Author)
  A clear purpose is the cornerstone of any effective dashboard. Without a well-defined goal, your dashboard risks becoming just another data dump. The objective is to create visualizations that direct users toward actionable conclusions. This is achieved by making it easy to compare, analyze, and interpret the data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9rhk9mxc155h6zt9q6hz30k))
- To get started, ask yourself these critical questions:
  **1. Who**: Who is the intended audience for this dashboard? Understanding your audience is crucial to tailoring the design to their needs.
  **2. Why**: Why does this audience need to see this data? What decisions are they trying to make?
  **3. What**: What key metrics will provide the insights needed to support those decisions?
  **4. How**: How will the audience use this dashboard? Will it be for high-level monitoring, or will they need to drill down into the details?
  **5. When**: When will this dashboard be used? Will it be referenced daily, weekly, or only in specific situations?
  **6. Design :** How should the dashboard be structured to logically guide users through the data? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9rhkd315avs037jhjxn8tsb))

  3. What: Choosing the Right Metrics
  Not every metric deserves a spot on your dashboard. Prioritize those that provide clear insights and lead to meaningful actions:
  **Relative Metrics**: Show change over time or across categories, helping you track trends and spot patterns. 
  *Examples : Year-over-Year Revenue Growth, Sales Growth Rate Compared to Category Average*
  **Proportional Metrics**: Illustrate the relationship between different data points. 
  *Examples : Customer Retention Rate, Active User Ratio.*
  **Actionable Metrics**: Focus on metrics that drive specific actions, often serving as leading indicators for key business outcomes.

  5. When : Timing is Everything
  Choosing the right time frame for your data is crucial for generating meaningful insights. Depending on the dashboard’s purpose, you might select different time scales:
  • **Hourly**: Ideal for real-time monitoring, such as tracking service usage or system performance.
  • **Daily**: Useful for addressing immediate business needs, like order volume monitoring.
  • **Weekly**: Common for standard dashboards monitoring campaign efficiency or user engagement.
  • **Monthly**: Best for strategic reviews, such as assessing financial health during executive meetings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9rhmjxqhg6bsrr8wp8p9rmw))
