## Highlights
- t is the ﬁrst portal dedicated enCrely to land for energy projects. There are several companies in Europe looking for land to install renewal energy acCviCes. Companies spend €6B on looking for these lands. It is not easy to get a cheap assessment of the land. There is a big market entry. There is no transparency.
  Their soluCon blends Geospace analysis, AI and a marketplace feature. Therefore, they can provide a good indicaCon about the viability of any lot of land for a potenCal renewable energy project. The company received funding from the ESA. The planorm is in an app but can be integrated with property portal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddyn5qagc60npwz3g3ep3gz))
- Pipeimob, a TRM (TransacCon RelaConship Management) planorm, provide banking and contract management services for Real Estate brokers as CRMs do not usually provide them.

- 70% of Spanish land is unoccupied. Orygen wants to ﬁnd a use for the land. It ﬁnds a sustainable and producCve soluCon for unused lands, always focused on carbon absorpCon. Developers, agricultural companies… can work with them. It is tedious to understand the regulaCons and knowing the details of the lands. With their technology, they limit the land and examinate, understanding the technical and legal factor. They deﬁne the acCvity for the land, what drives to an increase in the land value.

- Run by two AI experts and born in 2021, they are currently working with idealista.

- With AutoAd they rate the diﬀerent photos and automaCcally organize the order of the photos to make a lisCng more appealing. AutoAd has been tested by leading Spanish portals, services, and agencies.
  Autolist is similar logic than AutoAd, but aimed for portals use. It also provides an algorithm to posiCon the most appealing properCes in the best places, providing a bePer user experience and service to users. With Autolist, quality of the photos is also improved. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddyqf1r2xp7312jz418dfw0))
- Sweden has a stable, eﬃcient, and favorable property market. Their rental market is dysfuncConal, not working properly, so people normally buy for living and no for investment. In Sweden you are not allowed to buy an apartment to rent immediately, then the rental market is really complex and there is almost no business there, so that is why they not work in this area. There are less presence of investors and speculaCon. They have a seller-paid model where agents are partners and reseller the service to property owners. It is very unique in the industry, only Hemnet in Sweden and REA in Australia are the big portals with this business mode ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddys58czdvgrsryr3en9n6j))
- They created a win-win proposiCon for sellers. Francesca is sure that sellers are more willing to pay than agents, as they are the ones gevng the complete ﬁnancial result when the property is sold. In Sweden the Cme to sell a property is reduced, with 30-40 days.
  The next move is introducing segmented pricing. They want to capture the opCmal willingness to pay in each transacCon to maximize revenue. They want to match the seller and the price of the property on this moment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddytgdq4zghy0th0rts375p))
- With this, they were able to broaden the pricing range of their products and now Hemnet is more able to extract value from pricing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddyvca03g1yppadp7585ygd))
- hey use the concept of ARPL “Average Revenue per LisCng” (like ARPU). In their analysis, they found that REA is able to capture 0,35-0,4% value of the lisCng, while Hemnet only 0,1%. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddytz3sy4acft8232c46mky))
- Ait recognize that inside AVIV Group there are not enough capabiliCes to build everything themselves. Therefore, they decided to open their planorm to third party providers through APIs to integrate their services and complement the complete oﬀer of their pornolio. Later, the value created and moneCzed is shared through revenue sharing schemes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddywv2kc8fd2rq9g6je3gqr))
- oStar started in the US with the non-residenCal real estate business; they have the leader portal of buying a selling farms, land, and small business in the US. They ﬁrstly decided to move further inside commercial real estate and, in a second phase, entering on the tradiConal real estate, like residenCal. CoStar tried to acquire the 2nd biggest RE portal in the US, but as the price requested was too high, they opted for acquiring, two years ago, the 5th and boosCng its growth. Now Homes.com has become the second portal, ahead of realtor.com and Redﬁn, and their will try to become the ﬁrst in the future, although Zillow is sCll far from them. Andy claims to have a 129% YoY growth in Homes.com and that the investment in SEM is so big that Google is lending SEO engineers to improve their website. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddyymfkmymmc1wkkxjmk1t6))
- CoStar companies in Europe are smaller than in the US, however they want to grow exponenCally. Their objecCve is digitalizing real estate, in the US and Europe. They are looking for market opportuniCes in Europe. They want to become leader in residenCal in the US before ﬁnishing their biggest investments in Europe. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddyz2es20zz4gxxrf7mpafa))
- Andy says that a consolidaCon process will start in Europe. As there are common players working in diﬀerent markets as Google, Facebook or even MaPerport, something similar will happen with portals. He believes that there are undervalued and overvalued companies in Europe, with a big change going on in the next 5 years. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddyzewcbf736zncwy6s9tb2))
- They are the leading commercial portal in the UK. They are interested on all the markets. A dramaCc consolidaCon in Europe will take place, as it is hard to compete. In the US they had several regional players, that today are consolidated on 4. Technology is quite similar across markets, if business model can be adjusted to each country, they can succeed. There are more similariCes than diﬀerences according to him. In addiCon, there are currently strong crossboarder traﬃc and scale synergies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddyzqkh1v8vfaypm1gpj64n))
- Zoopla can be something interesCng for M&A, as Andy admits, he prefers them to Rightmove as they are more innovaCve while Rightmove has been focused mainly on moneCzaCon, having high margins, but being overvalued as their mulCplies should not be as high. Andy says that in Europe PE funds are doubling or tripling the value by selling it between them every four years, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddz09k3x03c5q0yvgccwjzd))
- Andy explains that in the B2C market create trust across consumers is key. They normally perceive the leader as trustworthy and safe, that is why brand is so strong in these cases. CoStar look portals as two parts, the two-sided business, and the data business, that has its own value. They are looking for number 1, 2, 3 or 4 in the market. They need to scale up and want to acquire portals as they are good on moneCzing data capabiliCes and improve SEO results. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddz1680jet6jdhjbrxa38m5))
- CoStar management team integrates leaders from the acquired companies, from 50 people in management team, around 10 comes from acquired companies.
  Oﬃce building are becoming homes, there are strong connecCons between both markets and a company can be successful in both if can understand it well and act rapidly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddz1v9yr1d7ttwhxzffq21m))
- Jaroslaw, who was the CEO of Morizon, states that they were compeCng with another portal for the second posiCon in Poland and they decided to merge with the other challenger, Gratka, to create a strong number two in Poland, under the umbrella of Axel Springer, with ability to moneCze. They shided customers from both portals to a single package (like Pack Max), combining prices by 1,8 so there were a strong increase in prices while customers had a signiﬁcant discount. They introduced this combined pack with a GBB pricing scheme. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddz8n2wdbmcwp5btzkrepjg))
- Developers are a side part of the business, Morizon-Gratka is the number three in the country in this market, so they cannot moneCze as well, (only 2% of their revenue comes from ND). Therefore, the investment on technology and resources is not as strong. He believes that the tradiConal model, not focused on the lead, is not as good for developers. When talking about moving closer to transacCon, Jaroslaw emphasizes the diﬀerent in the model and in the Cming. With leads you get the revenue immediately, with the transacCon you need to wait Cll the end of the process, what is challenging and a game changer for portal business mind.

- hey also entered on mortgage and insurance products. In gross revenues the percentage is bigger. If the broker gets the lead himself, he can get a 20% of the commission and if he also provides the lead can reach the 50% ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddz9ekkcqn2rax0s98p1585))

Today, they provide back-end digital soluCons to opCmize the content with Computer Vision and they switched their operaCons on AI to be more scalable, ﬁrstly with Deep Learning and now with immersive and customizable viewing using GeneraCve AI ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddza4zr4g2ar6nyddqve0qf))
- Josh compares virtual staging with generaCve AI. Virtual staging is a manual process with a cost of $16 per image, with some hours of work. Cost with AI is lower than a cent and Cming is immediate. With AI it is east to change wall colors, materials of a kitchen or a bathroom, furniture, decoraCon ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddzan0z4deefy75dr9g418a))
- Houseful is the parent company of the portal Zoopla and other companies such as the CRMs Alto or Jupix. Zoopla is the second property portal in the UK, being a relevant desCnaCon for both, home ﬁnders and homeowners. Homeowners need to understand the value of their property.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddzc85ztb8f8s51d61ea8yj))
- Some people know exactly where to live and loke for a property in this speciﬁc place. Other people have a city where they want to live and perhaps some requirements like closeness to good schools, while there are people thinking only about the region, with a range 100km ﬂexibility, a trend increased now due to remote working. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddzd06kxvr7sh83tkjpy9dr))
- When talking about what is important to ﬁnd a new area to live the ﬁrst thing is to be close to green areas. They have 3x conversion on travel Cme vs normal home page. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddzd5cdx7wafn9tkk058rjr))
- Ben lives in Peckham, 1h drive away from oﬃce. The example here is showing what is 10km or 1h drive away from London Bridge staCon, so they are providing more opportuniCes and helping clients to ﬁnd new suitable areas for their homes. Therefore, Ben recommends to embed travel Cme in every search and personalize every journey with it creaCng a unique Single Consumer Proﬁle unifying his data and generaCng insights. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddzdgyaywa694qjpxxkwtxs))
- Zoopla, together with TravelTIme, is also providing users with informaCon about neighborhoods, about its traﬃc, points of interest, services, demographic informaCon… Chris starts talking about the progression of locaCon search, as it can improve the conversion of users visiCng a portal, as they can reach more opportuniCes fulﬁlling their life needs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddzdrpwvks8b6bejjqtamve))
- BreP states that a common broker or agent is using up to 9 diﬀerent technology providers, a huge number compared with their size and business volume. He believes that there is sCll room to digiClize brokers and agents’ work, as they perform several manual acCviCes with the potenCal of being automaCzed. In conclusion, they believe there is sCll unlock value to provide to the agents. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddze9hhc8sb92m086jpts27))
- Lukas starts with a monopoly analogy, staCng that if you can only see a quarter of the board, you have liPle possibiliCes to win. You are not able idenCfy opportuniCes beyond your short sight. Most of business players are only seen a part of the board, while a small part is using data properly to maximize visibility of the board.
  ProperBird soluCons can help portals to overcome this obstacle. For example, Immowelt idenCﬁes its exclusive lisCngs, that are the ones giving more value, and highlights them in the planorm, taking advantage of its own content. Another success story is Otodom, a Polish planorm. Otodom discovered thanks to ProperBird tool that agents were compeCng for the same property, generaCng revenue opportuniCes of upselling to agents. They work also with Immobiliare and Immovelt. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddzg1nmp1bqntn6a8z2ak46))
- Lukas admits that they crawl in real Cme the real estate planorms. He admits that today everybody scraps everybody. He has no fear of anC-scraper blocks, as they learn how to bypass them easily and in liPle Cme. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddzg81xkn66h0a9hjw2b6mq))
- Another soluCon they have is a kind of Dedup that deduplicates and cleans data on property and agents across diﬀerent portals and RE websites. Lukas oﬀered it to as, although our Dedup and data products already match more or less the funcConaliCes of his product pornolio.

- , Branislava talks about inspiring and moCvaCng your team. When starCng from the boPom, clients are always going to value more the leader or main challengers than you, so your salespeople need to be prepared to counteract and build up the brand. They should convey that your challenger portal is providing innovaCon and real value to the market, and that they are leaders in that way. When you are a challenger portal you cannot be defensive, while leaders can wait and defense. You need to be more aggressive and aPack unexpectedly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddzssvawpf1nwpg3197k954))
- Inspira realized that Belgrade was the leader’s basCon and cannot be taken easily, so they decided to take the rest of Serbian areas to grow income, become more ﬁnancially stable, form a mature team, and test the product to improve it. They did so and become leaders, entering later in Belgrade from a stronger posiCon. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddzt3z84nxzpj44jacw7jjm))
- One of the problems for a challenger when they shake the market is that this new situaCon invites new ﬁrms to join the market and to become compeCtors or force incumbents to react, innovate and be mor reacCve. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddztapcke7sj82tmqar4mk3))
