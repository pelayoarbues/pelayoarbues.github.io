Companies spend €6B on looking for these lands. It is not easy to get a cheap assessment of the land. There is a big market entry. There is no transparency.
  Their soluCon blends Geospace analysis, AI and a marketplace feature. Therefore, they can provide a good indicaCon about the viability of any lot of land for a potenCal renewable energy project.

- 70% of Spanish land is unoccupied. Orygen wants to ﬁnd a use for the land. It ﬁnds a sustainable and producCve soluCon for unused lands, always focused on carbon absorpCon. Developers, agricultural companies… can work with them. It is tedious to understand the regulaCons and knowing the details of the lands. With their technology, they limit the land and examinate, understanding the technical and legal factor. They deﬁne the acCvity for the land, what drives to an increase in the land value.

- Sweden has a stable, eﬃcient, and favorable property market. Their rental market is dysfuncConal, not working properly, so people normally buy for living and no for investment. In Sweden you are not allowed to buy an apartment to rent immediately, then the rental market is really complex and there is almost no business there, so that is why they not work in this area. There are less presence of investors and speculaCon. They have a seller-paid model where agents are partners and reseller the service to property owners. It is very unique in the industry, only Hemnet in Sweden and REA in Australia are the big portals with this business mode ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddys58czdvgrsryr3en9n6j))
- They created a win-win proposiCon for sellers. Francesca is sure that sellers are more willing to pay than agents, as they are the ones gevng the complete ﬁnancial result when the property is sold. In Sweden the Cme to sell a property is reduced, with 30-40 days.
  The next move is introducing segmented pricing. They want to capture the opCmal willingness to pay in each transacCon to maximize revenue. They want to match the seller and the price of the property on this moment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddytgdq4zghy0th0rts375p))
- With this, they were able to broaden the pricing range of their products and now Hemnet is more able to extract value from pricing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddyvca03g1yppadp7585ygd))
- hey use the concept of ARPL “Average Revenue per LisCng” (like ARPU). In their analysis, they found that REA is able to capture 0,35-0,4% value of the lisCng, while Hemnet only 0,1%. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddytz3sy4acft8232c46mky))
- Ait recognize that inside AVIV Group there are not enough capabiliCes to build everything themselves. Therefore, they decided to open their planorm to third party providers through APIs to integrate their services and complement the complete oﬀer of their pornolio.

- oStar started in the US with the non-residenCal real estate business; they have the leader portal of buying a selling farms, land, and small business in the US. They ﬁrstly decided to move further inside commercial real estate and, in a second phase, entering on the tradiConal real estate, like residenCal. CoStar tried to acquire the 2nd biggest RE portal in the US, but as the price requested was too high, they opted for acquiring, two years ago, the 5th and boosCng its growth. Now Homes.com has become the second portal, ahead of realtor.com and Redﬁn, and their will try to become the ﬁrst in the future, although Zillow is sCll far from them. Andy claims to have a 129% YoY growth in Homes.com and that the investment in SEM is so big that Google is lending SEO engineers to improve their website. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddyymfkmymmc1wkkxjmk1t6))
- CoStar companies in Europe are smaller than in the US, however they want to grow exponenCally. Their objecCve is digitalizing real estate, in the US and Europe. They are looking for market opportuniCes in Europe. They want to become leader in residenCal in the US before ﬁnishing their biggest investments in Europe. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddyz2es20zz4gxxrf7mpafa))
- Andy says that a consolidaCon process will start in Europe. As there are common players working in diﬀerent markets as Google, Facebook or even MaPerport, something similar will happen with portals. He believes that there are undervalued and overvalued companies in Europe, with a big change going on in the next 5 years. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddyzewcbf736zncwy6s9tb2))
- They are the leading commercial portal in the UK. They are interested on all the markets. A dramaCc consolidaCon in Europe will take place, as it is hard to compete. In the US they had several regional players, that today are consolidated on 4. Technology is quite similar across markets, if business model can be adjusted to each country, they can succeed. There are more similariCes than diﬀerences according to him. In addiCon, there are currently strong crossboarder traﬃc and scale synergies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddyzqkh1v8vfaypm1gpj64n))
- Zoopla can be something interesCng for M&A, as Andy admits, he prefers them to Rightmove as they are more innovaCve while Rightmove has been focused mainly on moneCzaCon, having high margins, but being overvalued as their mulCplies should not be as high. Andy says that in Europe PE funds are doubling or tripling the value by selling it between them every four years, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddz09k3x03c5q0yvgccwjzd))
- Andy explains that in the B2C market create trust across consumers is key. They normally perceive the leader as trustworthy and safe, that is why brand is so strong in these cases. CoStar look portals as two parts, the two-sided business, and the data business, that has its own value. They are looking for number 1, 2, 3 or 4 in the market. They need to scale up and want to acquire portals as they are good on moneCzing data capabiliCes and improve SEO results. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddz1680jet6jdhjbrxa38m5))

- Jaroslaw, who was the CEO of Morizon, states that they were compeCng with another portal for the second posiCon in Poland and they decided to merge with the other challenger, Gratka, to create a strong number two in Poland, under the umbrella of Axel Springer, with ability to moneCze. They shided customers from both portals to a single package (like Pack Max), combining prices by 1,8 so there were a strong increase in prices while customers had a signiﬁcant discount. They introduced this combined pack with a GBB pricing scheme. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddz8n2wdbmcwp5btzkrepjg))
- Developers are a side part of the business, Morizon-Gratka is the number three in the country in this market, so they cannot moneCze as well, (only 2% of their revenue comes from ND). Therefore, the investment on technology and resources is not as strong. He believes that the tradiConal model, not focused on the lead, is not as good for developers. When talking about moving closer to transacCon, Jaroslaw emphasizes the diﬀerent in the model and in the Cming. With leads you get the revenue immediately, with the transacCon you need to wait Cll the end of the process, what is challenging and a game changer for portal business mind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddz986k8653txjgc3btf3vy))

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddzdrpwvks8b6bejjqtamve))
- BreP states that a common broker or agent is using up to 9 diﬀerent technology providers, a huge number compared with their size and business volume. He believes that there is sCll room to digiClize brokers and agents’ work, as they perform several manual acCviCes with the potenCal of being automaCzed. In conclusion, they believe there is sCll unlock value to provide to the agents. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddze9hhc8sb92m086jpts27))
- Lukas starts with a monopoly analogy, staCng that if you can only see a quarter of the board, you have liPle possibiliCes to win. You are not able idenCfy opportuniCes beyond your short sight. Most of business players are only seen a part of the board, while a small part is using data properly to maximize visibility of the board.
  ProperBird soluCons can help portals to overcome this obstacle. For example, Immowelt idenCﬁes its exclusive lisCngs, that are the ones giving more value, and highlights them in the planorm, taking advantage of its own content. Another success story is Otodom, a Polish planorm. Otodom discovered thanks to ProperBird tool that agents were compeCng for the same property, generaCng revenue opportuniCes of upselling to agents. They work also with Immobiliare and Immovelt. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddzg1nmp1bqntn6a8z2ak46))

- , Branislava talks about inspiring and moCvaCng your team. When starCng from the boPom, clients are always going to value more the leader or main challengers than you, so your salespeople need to be prepared to counteract and build up the brand. They should convey that your challenger portal is providing innovaCon and real value to the market, and that they are leaders in that way. When you are a challenger portal you cannot be defensive, while leaders can wait and defense. You need to be more aggressive and aPack unexpectedly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hddzssvawpf1nwpg3197k954))
- Inspira realized that Belgrade was the leader’s basCon and cannot be taken easily, so they decided to take the rest of Serbian areas to grow income, become more ﬁnancially stable, form a mature team, and test the product to improve it.

LLMs can predict next word, but the broader the context is, the best predicCon they will be able to provide. Davor explains that neural networks are simple, with around 2.000 lines of code. At the end of the day, LLMs are knowledge ﬁlters. They can generate new things, that seem real although the never exist (e.g. he shows an image of a woman driving a cab in Madrid in 1935, a situaCon that was, of course, not real at this Cme).
