## Highlights
- A week ago, OpenAI released an exciting new demo, featuring a voice character with a sexy breathy voice that was supposed to remind you of Scarlett Johansson’s AI agent character in the fabulous film *Her*. Lots of people gushed over it. (Some worried about the sexism, as well they should, but that’s a story for another day. And of course I daresay the demo was *just* a demo, one that will never work robustly as advertised, but that too is a story for another day.)

- The (old, now-replaced) Board said in November they fired Sam because he was not consistently candid. I saw that with his fudges to the Senate about OpenAI equity (he has indirect equity, which he failed to mention, and owns an OpenAI VC firm that trades on the company name that he failed to mention), the board saw it with his lies about Helen Toner, and now we all see it with his embarrassing lies about Scarlett Johansson.
