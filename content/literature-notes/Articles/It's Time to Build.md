## Highlights
- In other words, to build a great data business, today’s startups don’t have to come up with particularly novel ideas or get a bunch of bets about the market right. They just have to rebuild what’s already there, but more deliberately and on more certain ground than the original pioneers could.[6](https://benn.substack.com/p/its-time-to-build#footnote-6) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmhf2jka3spg5af5ys0yr1vf))
- [Omni](https://omni.co/) and [SQLMesh](https://sqlmesh.com/) are two companies that seem to be doing exactly that. Omni is, almost literally, a Looker rerun, with [several of the same founders and investors](https://omni.co/about). Though there are minor structural differences between the products, Omni’s primary pitch is about [improved usability](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/16/omni-looks-to-take-on-looker-with-its-cloud-powered-bi-platform/#:~:text=have%20to%20overcome%3A-,poor%20usability,-.%20He%E2%80%99s%20the). It’s mostly the same thing, just polished and built for 2022 instead of 2012. Similarly, SQLMesh [aggressively markets itself](https://tobikodata.com/the-false-promise-of-dbt-contracts.html) as a renovated dbt that’s fundamentally the same product—in-warehouse SQL-based transformations with a web IDE—but built with the advantages of knowing what people liked about dbt, and what they struggled with.
