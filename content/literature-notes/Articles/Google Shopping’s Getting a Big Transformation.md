## Highlights
- People shop across Google more than a billion times a day to do things like [virtually try on clothes before they buy](https://blog.google/products/shopping/virtual-try-on-google-generative-ai/), [shop what they see with Lens](https://blog.google/products/shopping/visual-search-lens-shopping/) and [research prices](https://blog.google/products/shopping/google-shopping-best-holiday-deals-2023/). We've been using our advances in AI to make shopping on Google even easier, and today, we’re introducing a transformed Google Shopping — rebuilt from the ground up with AI. We’ve paired the 45 billion product listings in [Google’s Shopping Graph](https://blog.google/products/shopping/shopping-graph-explained/) with [Gemini models](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/%20%3C-) to transform the online shopping experience with a new, personalized shopping home, which is rolling out in the U.S. over the coming weeks, starting today.

- The new Google Shopping experience uses AI to intelligently show the most relevant products, helping to speed up and simplify your research. You’ll now get an AI-generated brief with top things to consider for your search, plus products that meet your needs. Let's say, like me, you’re looking for a new winter jacket — but not just any winter jacket. You want something that will keep you warm *and* dry in the Pacific Northwest.

- Here’s how it works: A search for “Men’s winter jacket for Seattle” will provide an AI brief with the most important things you should know before investing in a new coat for this climate. We’ll show products recommended by sources from across the web, and an explanation of why they’re a fit for your needs. You’ll also see categories that give you a more organized view of the types of jackets to consider. For those who want to research more deeply on the web, you can easily click through to relevant articles. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jadzhy5gnv0nfjm7rkhddfrq))
- In addition, your results will include dynamic filters that let you zero in on your preferences — like if you need a certain size or want something available near you, now. This new experience also incorporates our [virtual try-on feature](https://blog.google/products/shopping/ai-virtual-try-on-google-shopping/), powered by generative AI and [AR](https://blog.google/products/shopping/ar-beauty-shopping-ads/) [shopping](https://blog.google/products/shopping/more-ways-to-shop-in-ar/) [tools](https://blog.google/products/shopping/google-shopping-back-to-school-tips/) to help you shop more confidently.

- Shopping is personal — that’s why the new Google Shopping home page has a personalized feed to inspire you with shoppable products and videos based on your preferences. And because most of us will research purchases over several days or weeks, Google Shopping lets you pick up right where you left off last time. Tap the Google Shopping logo or visit [shopping.google.com](http://shopping.google.com/) to find your feed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jadzjj0t78601qgmhq7j4mgs))
- We know shoppers always want low prices, and the new Google Shopping not only includes deal-finding tools like price comparison, price insights and price tracking throughout, but also a new dedicated and personalized deals page where you can browse deals for you - just click the “Deals” link at the top of your page to explore. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jadzkpkym14m88j8dhr3hgxg))
- Google Shopping lets you shop every store in one place — and we're continuing to develop more ways brands can connect directly with shoppers, whether that's through assistive experiences like AI shopping or with rich product listing ads. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jadzjx81mdynhvht4477w0nw))
- As you use the new Google Shopping, you’ll see an “experimental” label on the AI-generated briefs — that’s because this new, experimental feature may not always get it right — so we encourage shoppers to provide feedback through the three dot menu on the brief to help us improve. You can find the new Google Shopping via the “Shopping Tab” on Google Search or by visiting [shopping.google.com](http://shopping.google.com/). The new Google Shopping is rolling out in the U.S. over the coming weeks, starting today. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jadzk59yhq5mnzbz5rwymnft))
