## Highlights
- NVIDIA today announced Nemotron-4 340B, a family of open models that developers can use to generate synthetic data for training large language models (LLMs) for commercial applications across healthcare, finance, manufacturing, retail and every other industry. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0hbf3ftyrq2ggt2gy4s1hwm))
- High-quality training data plays a critical role in the performance, accuracy and quality of responses from a custom LLM — but robust datasets can be prohibitively expensive and difficult to access. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0hbfat19jp8ank661bx49z3))
- Through a uniquely permissive [open model license](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/licenses/nvidia-open-model-license-agreement-june-2024.pdf), Nemotron-4 340B gives developers a free, scalable way to generate synthetic data that can help build powerful LLMs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0hbfgs6tyxnj4btevpgkbwk))
- The Nemotron-4 340B family includes base, instruct and reward models that form a pipeline to generate synthetic data used for training and refining LLMs. The models are optimized to work with [NVIDIA NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo), an open-source framework for end-to-end model training, including data curation, customization and evaluation. They’re also optimized for inference with the open-source [NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) library. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0hbfnsf1yxsrp82xx08jk41))
- Nemotron-4 340B can be downloaded now from the [NVIDIA NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/models?filters=&orderBy=scoreDESC&query=nemotron-4-340b) catalog and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-4-340b-666b7ebaf1b3867caf2f1911). Developers will soon be able to access the models at [ai.nvidia.com](http://ai.nvidia.com/), where they’ll be packaged as an [NVIDIA NIM](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-nim-offers-optimized-inference-microservices-for-deploying-ai-models-at-scale/) microservice with a standard application programming interface that can be deployed anywhere. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0hbfr6ae9sx6cwf6vtfwmgk))
- The [Nemotron-4 340B Instruct](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/nemotron-4-340b-instruct) model creates diverse synthetic data that mimics the characteristics of real-world data, helping improve data quality to increase the performance and robustness of custom LLMs across various domains. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0hbfx0czvgn8xmgc9fc107d))
- Then, to boost the quality of the AI-generated data, developers can use the [Nemotron-4 340B Reward](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/nemotron-4-340b-reward) model to filter for high-quality responses. Nemotron-4 340B Reward grades responses on five attributes: helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity and verbosity. It’s currently first place on the [Hugging Face RewardBench leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/allenai/reward-bench), created by [AI2](https://allenai.org/), for evaluating the capabilities, safety and pitfalls of reward models. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0hbg5zk918xsetb20w6afzr))
- Researchers can also create their own instruct or reward models by customizing the [Nemotron-4 340B Base](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/nemotron-4-340b-base) model using their proprietary data, combined with the included [HelpSteer2 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer2). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0hbggc2cj688kqxscp56snw))
- All Nemotron-4 340B models are optimized with TensorRT-LLM to take advantage of tensor parallelism, a type of model parallelism in which individual weight matrices are split across multiple GPUs and servers, enabling efficient inference at scale. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0hbgtpjm9ty3c9bzv38k6fb))
- Nemotron-4 340B Base, trained on 9 trillion tokens, can be customized using the NeMo framework to adapt to specific use cases or domains. This fine-tuning process benefits from extensive pretraining data and yields more accurate outputs for specific downstream tasks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0hbhbcpz94h1xvyqyfnnbv1))
- To boost model quality, developers can align their models with [NeMo Aligner](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner) and datasets annotated by Nemotron-4 340B Reward. Alignment is a key step in training LLMs, where a model’s behavior is fine-tuned using algorithms like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to ensure its outputs are safe, accurate, contextually appropriate and consistent with its intended goals.
