## Highlights
- Bayesian Optimization uses Bayesian statistics to estimate the distribution of the best hyperparameters for the model instead of just using grid search or random search. During the tuning process, the algorithm updates its beliefs about the distribution of the best hyperparameters based on each hyperparameter's observed impact on the model's performance. This allows it to gradually converge on the optimal set of hyperparameters, resulting in better performance on the test set.
