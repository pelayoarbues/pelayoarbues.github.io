## Highlights
- The amount of homes listed for sale and then delisted – taken off the market without selling – is rocketing to all-time highs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s32vrxjptmvyj6wyy3fxve))
- **Why it matters**: Rising delistings are a sign of a pricing imbalance, with asking prices higher than what buyers are willing to pay. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s32z64eyb02g404mvgcbeb))
- National delistings, as a percentage of total listings, are roughly double the normal rate, bucking seasonal trends, and accelerating rapidly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s336dg9ah9pm1w9d9h2bcf))
- **It all starts with pricing** – and new listings coming to market are being priced very high.
  • The median price per square foot on new listings is at record highs.

- **Another sign of a pricing** imbalance are price drops, the number of which are also rising.
  • The percentage of active listings with price reductions is higher than it’s been for years, and is increasing.

- **And for the houses** that *are* selling, it’s taking longer.
  • The median amount of days on market is slowly increasing and is higher than past years.

- **The bottom line**: The surge of [new listings coming to market](https://www.mikedp.com/articles/2024/5/2/mixed-messages-in-the-market) are overpriced, leading to a rapidly increasing number of delistings and price drops. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s34a6wwmt6j5gx5tvqcfg2))
- This is the start of a price correction; sellers are bringing more inventory to market, but with “aspirational pricing” that buyers are not willing to pay. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s34br0ta8gecmjrts788pa))
- The record number of pricing corrective measures will likely lead to an overall correction – lower prices – as supply and demand continues to rebalance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s34fdz2zm7rsyb0f4394ct))
