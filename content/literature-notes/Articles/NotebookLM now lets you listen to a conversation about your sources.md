## Highlights
- . Google’s [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) is effectively an end-user customizable RAG product. It lets you gather together multiple “sources” - documents, pasted text, links to web pages and YouTube videos - into a single interface where you can then use chat to ask questions of them. Under the hood it’s powered by their long-context Gemini 1.5 Pro LLM. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9mb0e6w094ss7t55s3rszw8))
- Audio Overview is a fun new feature which is getting a lot of attention right now. It effectively generates a one-off custom podcast against your sources, where two AI hosts start up a “deep dive” discussion about the collected content. These last around ten minutes and are *very* podcast, with an astonishingly convincing audio back-and-forth conversation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9mb0kz81ngnf9yj6m37yv1x))
