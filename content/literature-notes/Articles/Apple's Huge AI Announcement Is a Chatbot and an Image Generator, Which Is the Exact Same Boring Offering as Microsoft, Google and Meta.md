- The system's "new" capabilities are a very familiar mishmash of AI stuff we've seen before from other companies, including integrating generative AI into Siri and a surprisingly basic image generator that can create "[Genmojis](https://x.com/caro_milanesi/status/1800233968815812976)" while chatting.
