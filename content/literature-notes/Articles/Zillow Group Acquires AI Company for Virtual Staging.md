## Highlights
- Zillow Group has acquired Virtual Staging AI (VSAI), a company whose technology helps home sellers, agents and photographers create digitally staged listing images without the need for physical furniture and decor. The acquisition closed Oct. 7, 2024, and the VSAI teams are beginning to integrate into Zillow. 
  We’re excited to bring this technology to real estate professionals as part of Zillow’s broad suite of software and advertising solutions. VSAI offers the next generation of listing innovation to elevate the listing experience on Zillow for home shoppers. Their AI-powered virtual staging technology generates listing photos that are nearly indistinguishable from traditionally staged listings.

- Real estate professionals can easily upload room photos, select a room type and furniture style, and create high-quality, fully staged images almost instantly with the click of a button, thanks to VSAI’s cutting-edge, interactive technology. Being able to stage spaces and edit the images within seconds eliminates wait time and back-and-forth to implement changes.
  The acquisition of VSAI underscores Zillow’s commitment to enabling the real estate industry to become more digital, integrated and productive. By leveraging Zillow’s tech, AI and product expertise, real estate professionals can focus on serving their clients with the high-value, person-to-person work that makes a customer experience exceptional.

For example, 71% of sellers say they’re more likely to hire an agent who includes virtual tours and/or interactive floor plans in their services, according to Zillow’s 2024 Consumer Housing Trends Report. Virtual staging gives sellers another interactive media option to enhance their listing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja51hpm793p1a4269ae4xk17))
