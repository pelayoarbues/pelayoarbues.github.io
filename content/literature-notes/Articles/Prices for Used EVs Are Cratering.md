- Prices for used electric vehicles are falling off a cliff, dipping well below those of their gas-guzzling counterparts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s4h55e73y79k2vtjppt4f2))
- As [*CNBC* reports](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/16/used-ev-price-crash-gets-deeper-with-premium-brand-idea-history.html), used EVs are selling for thousands of dollars less than they used to, with consumers increasingly rejecting "premium" pricing status for the once-buzzy vehicles.

- "It’s clear used car shoppers will no longer pay a premium for electric vehicles and, in fact, consider electric powertrains a detractor, making them less desirable — and less valuable — than traditional models," iSeeCars executive analyst Karl Brauer argued in a statement.

- It's the latest sign that the EV market is experiencing a rude awakening. There could be several factors at play, with consumers becoming wary of degrading batteries and the lagging development of charging infrastructure. Sky-high interest rates could also be dampening demand, especially for more expensive EVs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s4hxdk2yf0h2kwd9a0kcmb))
- Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also greatly contributed to the trend, [cutting prices](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-cuts-prices-electric-vehicles-8210ae10) of the carmaker's offerings on several occasions last year. His [abrasive behavior](https://futurism.com/civil-rights-groups-horrified-elon-musk-racist) has also served to tank Tesla's reputation, [scaring away](https://futurism.com/the-byte/buyers-avoiding-teslas-elon-musk-toxic) potential buyers.

- The EV maker, once [touted](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/teslas-elon-musk-vows-make-711813/) as the most important car company in the world, has seen [sales plummet this year](https://futurism.com/the-byte/many-unsold-teslas-space), and shares are down over 25 percent year to date. Recent satellite images [revealed](https://futurism.com/the-byte/many-unsold-teslas-space) that production is outpacing demand considerably, with unsold stock piling up at factories and dealerships. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s4jkfbw7yddh5rrpyy5vpr))
- Prices for used Teslas have also plummeted, [depreciating a whopping 28.9 percent](https://insideevs.com/news/712157/why-do-teslas-depreciate-so-fast/) on average in a single year — faster than Maseratis or Alfa Romeos, which are notorious for losing value — according to a previous study by iSeeCars.

- Meanwhile, carmakers are turning their [attention towards hybrid vehicles](https://futurism.com/the-byte/toyota-slams-electric-cars-says-theyll-never-catch-on), which combine the gas savings of a partially electric powertrain and the accessibility and convenience of a fuel tank. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s4jwkecf1wdc2r7y4yt43x))
- Could this really be the beginning of the end of EVs — or are they "becoming more normal," as [*InsideEVs* suggests](https://insideevs.com/news/723587/used-ev-prices-critical-materials/)? While demand for "premium" offerings is tanking, consumers have more access to cheaper alternatives than ever before. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s4k46e7vf8awycsbaea5r0))
