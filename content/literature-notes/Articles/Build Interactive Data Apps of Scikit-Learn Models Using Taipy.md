## Highlights
- While we have previously discussed about **[Taipy](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy)**, an open-source full-stack data application builder using **Python alone** (I also like to call it a supercharged version of Streamlit), we are yet to do a practical demo of building a data application.

- Taipy is genuinely one of the best application builders I have ever used. It’s hard for me to switch to any alternatives now. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyebd6nxf0c7yyjxqppwh6ce))
- Taipy has witnessed exponential growth over the last couple of months or so, which shows that more and more programmers are adopting it and finding it useful. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyebdryjp5qesqz76bvchnwq))
- I love Taipy’s mission of supporting data scientists and machine learning engineers in building full-stack apps themselves while Taipy takes care of all backend optimizations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyebe16bznhvtt6xef5rts6t))
