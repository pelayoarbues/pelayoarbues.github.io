## Highlights
- In particular, it shows that Altman and his ilk scoff at the idea of consent. In a different world, they could have built systems like ChatGPT and DALL-E by starting with licensed training data, or training data in the public domain, or even just training data that allowed creators to opt in.

- More fundamentally, it also makes it increasingly hard to even see Altman's crew as competent. The timeline he seems to have established — that he reached out for permission, didn't get it, and went ahead anyway, complete with the coy little "her" tweet — is far more damning than simply building a chatbot that sounded a lot like Johansson.

- And to Johansson's credit, the fight doesn't sound entirely personal: she explicitly connected OpenAI's disrespect to the broader harms brought on by its work and AI tech writ large. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyee7qxs1mymrcbhjsyce5vt))
