In fact, to be brutally honest, I consider it an overall terrible source for good product education. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyebm1k3yr3qbb1hkcbnmry1))
- Many of the best product people are not actually product people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyebmbtfkr9zkj40346qh9tn))
- I’ve never believed that you must be a product manager or a product leader in order to excel at, or even lead, product. In fact, recently I wrote about the [alternatives to product managers](https://d572Tw04.na1.hubspotlinksstarter.com/Ctc/UD+113/d572Tw04/VXcy28125gN-W1NR1Zd5-j7lnW2H1VMy5fmjm5N2bpc143m2ndW7Y8-PT6lZ3mSW78P2wq2_Qp_nW5m4xR82VnfCZN2hGbHW9CqKkW38BmqM1GJQ8WN7p3Z6ymnKVjW8YCRt226k4GrVNy9J87HnCt8VCXFny9k1jw5W7vy5Cy1QqxwTW4X7n5n4HP8nFVB7sM25WZ6LpW5Vm7d78_36-8N3mhtKSdbMVSW6JFt752-sZ-1VhDpH-8vSP_QV9K2013rPC_1W3D_pX96tKGMfW5LD0Qc8McmX_W5sfCpB4mK8m7VM8ygm2h-FhNW706QGl3CBR8dW6tCdkl5Lp58JVMJR9j3g0h7tW9j2Hfn77w7P6VFsN-J1yjHyJW5j1vcL5PJj4Lf8QrM7g04).
