## Highlights
- Data initiatives are too focused on democratizing access to information and not focused enough on driving business impact. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvb1gbaq0zc38r4fjge9ndr3))
- we need to have a much greater focus on business value produced by data…which doesn’t happen magically / on its own ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvb1gr8dpb4r6jt2ppthvrnf))
- If your data team is purely focused on democratizing access to information, its spend needs to be a very modest % of revenue. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvb1h4tt4agyg1pvg2rnc1v1))

## New highlights added March 12, 2023 at 7:55 PM
- There is some minimum viable data capability that is purely responsible for data infra and company-wide enablement, and this should be as small as is feasible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvbhg9ex0btey0fvxwy4pky0))
- some of the challenge the industry is having around valuing data work is this fundamental misunderstanding of the split between company-wide shared value and specific ROI *and the ability to accurately reflect this in a [chart of accounts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chart-accounts.asp)*. If you can’t see your data spend reflected in this way, it makes it impossible for the planning process to reason about how to grow or cut this spend.
