## Highlights
- In this article, we will use free AI services for code completion. And save tons of money from a GitHub Copilot subscription. First, we will configure continue.dev with the Groq API key and check how to use it. Ultimately, we will explore private and secure options if you don’t want to share your code. Added my review for small best llm models for coding. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j18h30913678qk02ncr56ry7))
- But GitHub copilot pricing costs us monthly 10$ for individual developers. Copilot business costs around 19$ per user per month and copilot enterprise costs 39$ per user per month. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j18h4259kewhpx7cdxk0znw6))
- Visit [Groq Cloud Console](https://console.groq.com), and log in with your email or Google account. Click on API Keys in the left sidebar. Again, click on “Create API Key” to create a new API key. Give a name, and it will generate the API key. Copy it and save it for later use. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j18h6qtgbc3mw1m63022vgem))
- Now open VS Code and go to extensions. Then type continue.dev in the search box. You will able to see multiple extensions. Click on “**Continue — Codestral, GPT-4o, and more**” created by continue.dev as shown in the below image and install it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j18h4ey30zs8mmvxbyk3ym6r))
- Choose “Use your API Key” and click on continue. Select the provider as Groq and the model as Llama or Mistral. Then, paste the API key copied from the Groq console. Click on Add Model. (As shown in the above image) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j18h4pse30fzdee4q29bhgga))
- Visit [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/) if you want to download the binary and run it. You can also visit the [Ollama Github](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) repository to check the docker setup instructions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j18h4zqza5dekkgdm0q5na0k))
- Currently, we will set up **Qwen2** llm. But if you want to try different models please visit the [Ollama Models library](https://ollama.com/library) and browse different models. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j18h53pbks0sgsm8602s54fy))
- Ollama will automatically run the model and get a response from it. We just need to send the model name in the requested data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j18h57wgn0fg10ews9ayeg25))
- It will open the AI service provider’s list. Select Ollama, you will be redirected to its configuration. It will explain to you how to pull/download models and top models to directly add in configs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j18h8dcrc7ap72jxexhtyvh0))
- While experimenting, I tried locally with qwen2, codegemma, granite-code models. Used the same prompt. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j18h5sb408hee6q5mj2crzn8))
- **Qwen2** model **performed** a lot **better** than codegemma and granite-code. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j18h61rpqz2xx8c0v24ap6jn))
- I hope this tutorial helps you to set up a free copilot on your machine. And useful to you. AI tools are a great help to speed up coding and fix minor issues. There will be some differences in functionality and answers compared to Github Copilot as they use the latest model. And whole team is dedicated to its functionality and developer experience.
