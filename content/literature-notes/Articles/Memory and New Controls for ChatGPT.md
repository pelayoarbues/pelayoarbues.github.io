## Highlights
- We’re testing the ability for ChatGPT to remember things you discuss to make future chats more helpful. You’re in control of ChatGPT’s memory. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmkw9xjbz0f1w4rs4kmbmq6))
- We’re testing memory with ChatGPT. Remembering things you discuss across all chats saves you from having to repeat information and makes future conversations more helpful. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmkweva7qqj60gdf3sr5e19))
- You're in control of ChatGPT's memory. You can explicitly tell it to remember something, ask it what it remembers, and tell it to forget conversationally or through settings. You can also turn it off entirely. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmkwj2qtwfhx17t2fq2632z))
- As you chat with ChatGPT, you can ask it to remember something specific or let it pick up details itself. ChatGPT’s memory will get better the more you use it and you'll start to notice the improvements over time. For example: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmkwqhcs638nxyzj61asavd))
- You’ve explained that you prefer meeting notes to have headlines, bullets and action items summarized at the bottom. ChatGPT remembers this and recaps meetings this way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmkwwb425s9eww56evhnhba))
- You’ve told ChatGPT you own a neighborhood coffee shop. When brainstorming messaging for a social post celebrating a new location, ChatGPT knows where to start. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmkx2yat4hehhvn1md1aeky))
- You mention that you have a toddler and that she loves jellyfish. When you ask ChatGPT to help create her birthday card, it suggests a jellyfish wearing a party hat. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmkx6rx99bwdcrm0k5ykpxa))
- As a kindergarten teacher with 25 students, you prefer 50-minute lessons with follow-up activities. ChatGPT remembers this when helping you create lesson plans. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmkx561grcdy6cr1n1zh0w6))
- If you want ChatGPT to forget something, just tell it. You can also view and delete specific memories or clear all memories in settings (Settings > Personalization > Manage Memory). ChatGPT's memories evolve with your interactions and aren't linked to specific conversations. Deleting a chat doesn't erase its memories; you must delete the memory itself. You can find more details in our [Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8590148-memory-faq). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmkxbbsw3b0zy92agsprahy))
- If you’d like to have a conversation without using memory, use temporary chat. Temporary chats won't appear in history, won't use memory, and won't be used to train our models. Learn more about temporary chats in our [Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8914046-temporary-chat-faq). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmkxh5rxa4mfn13zte65fw9))
- [Custom Instructions](https://openai.com/blog/custom-instructions-for-chatgpt) continue to allow you to provide ChatGPT with direct guidance on what you’d like it to know about you and how you’d like it to respond. For explicit information or instructions, you can add it to your Custom Instructions. For information shared via conversations, ChatGPT can remember relevant details for you.

- For Enterprise and Team users, memory can be useful when using ChatGPT for work. It can learn your style and preferences, and build upon past interactions. This saves you time and leads to more relevant and insightful responses. For example: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmky5vwt7qrsaer2mrr0347))
- The [Books GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-z77yDe7Vu-books) helps you find your next read. With memory enabled, it remembers your preferences, such as favorite genres or top books, and tailors recommendations accordingly, without needing repeated inputs.
