## Highlights
- It has done all of this for more than 20 years without turning to any of the adjacent revenue streams or transactional bells and whistles that most other portal companies have tried.
  While British consumers see Rightmove as a trusted place to look for a home, agents mostly see it as an uncaring, monolithic corporation.

- The U.S. real estate giant CoStar is worth $34 billion and has a track record of success when it comes to building up challenger portals. It's also about to buy one of Rightmove's main competitors with the expressed intention of taking its crown. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hggvx1q7ddxagy700zf8w9c8))

  Rightmove's CFO, Alison Dolan stressed that the growth would be "product-led" with agents paying more for extra products and services rather than being led by price increases which she said would continue to be "steady and compounding". Dolan also stated that Rightmove is not factoring in any significant fluctuation in agent numbers into its planning. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hggw2axpybt9g2f3h73khrbw))
