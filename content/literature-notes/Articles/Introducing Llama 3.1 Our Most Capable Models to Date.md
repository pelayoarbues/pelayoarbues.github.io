## Highlights
- We believe the latest generation of Llama will ignite new applications and modeling paradigms, including synthetic data generation to enable the improvement and training of smaller models, as well as model distillation—a capability that has never been achieved at this scale in open source. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3m81f1gg1rwz689hbt514ed))
- As part of this latest release, we’re introducing upgraded versions of the 8B and 70B models. These are multilingual and have a significantly longer context length of 128K, state-of-the-art tool use, and overall stronger reasoning capabilities. This enables our latest models to support advanced use cases, such as long-form text summarization, multilingual conversational agents, and coding assistants. We’ve also made changes to our license, allowing developers to use the outputs from Llama models—including the 405B—to improve other models. True to our commitment to open source, starting today, we’re making these models available to the community for download on [llama.meta.com](https://llama.meta.com/) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/meta-llama/llama-31-669fc079a0c406a149a5738f) and available for immediate development on our broad ecosystem of partner platforms.

- As our largest model yet, training Llama 3.1 405B on over 15 trillion tokens was a major challenge. To enable training runs at this scale and achieve the results we have in a reasonable amount of time, we significantly optimized our full training stack and pushed our model training to over 16 thousand H100 GPUs, making the 405B the first Llama model trained at this scale. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3m83nmn5c2d9dx92dgbtp6z))
- We opted for a standard decoder-only transformer model architecture with minor adaptations rather than a mixture-of-experts model to maximize training stability. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3m847qd92at8znzrq5t5az0))
- We adopted an iterative post-training procedure, where each round uses supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. This enabled us to create the highest quality synthetic data for each round and improve each capability’s performance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3m84fnymdsq51jr62haary4))
- As expected per scaling laws for language models, our new flagship model outperforms smaller models trained using the same procedure. We also used the 405B parameter model to improve the post-training quality of our smaller models. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3m84yzkxbga57e9we3fs9yf))
- To support large-scale production inference for a model at the scale of the 405B, we quantized our models from 16-bit (BF16) to 8-bit (FP8) numerics, effectively lowering the compute requirements needed and allowing the model to run within a single server node. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3m85618zvn0j4xc4y4tp1xt))
- With Llama 3.1 405B, we strove to improve the helpfulness, quality, and detailed instruction-following capability of the model in response to user instructions while ensuring high levels of safety. Our biggest challenges were supporting more capabilities, the 128K context window, and increased model sizes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3m85jyt68ybzmj9wek9dg5z))
- In post-training, we produce final chat models by doing several rounds of alignment on top of the pre-trained model. Each round involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Rejection Sampling (RS), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We use synthetic data generation to produce the vast majority of our SFT examples, iterating multiple times to produce higher and higher quality synthetic data across all capabilities. Additionally, we invest in multiple data processing techniques to filter this synthetic data to the highest quality. This enables us to scale the amount of fine-tuning data across capabilities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3m86d8rnnwyhea297y5gdz6))
- We carefully balance the data to produce a model with high quality across all capabilities. For example, we maintain the quality of our model on short-context benchmarks, even when extending to 128K context. Similarly, our model continues to provide maximally helpful answers, even as we add safety mitigations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3m86sx3hvta4re1mfgh10tp))
- Llama models were always intended to work as part of an overall system that can orchestrate several components, including calling external tools. Our vision is to go beyond the foundation models to give developers access to a broader system that gives them the flexibility to design and create custom offerings that align with their vision. This thinking started last year when we first [introduced](https://ai.meta.com/blog/purple-llama-open-trust-safety-generative-ai/) the incorporation of components outside of the core LLM. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3m87as1h7vsftpfwacswgq6))
- As part of our ongoing efforts to develop AI responsibly beyond the model layer and helping others to do the same, we’re releasing a full [reference system](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-agentic-system) that includes several sample applications and includes new components such as [Llama Guard 3](https://llama.meta.com/trust-and-safety/#safeguard-model%20?), a multilingual safety model and Prompt Guard, a prompt injection filter. These sample applications are open source and can be built on by the community. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3m87kqr01sqxs1fpydq7dp2))
- standardized and opinionated interfaces for how to build canonical toolchain components (fine-tuning, synthetic data generation) and agentic applications. Our hope is for these to become adopted across the ecosystem, which should help with easier interoperability. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3m88cs1s8gsmwxr7qxnewcc))
- Unlike closed models, Llama model weights are [available to download](https://llama.meta.com/). Developers can fully customize the models for their needs and applications, train on new datasets, and conduct additional fine-tuning. This enables the broader developer community and the world to more fully realize the power of generative AI. Developers can fully customize for their applications and run in any environment, including on prem, in the cloud, or even locally on a laptop—all without sharing data with Meta. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3m88r9rd9aecyavjack67y9))
- While many may argue that closed models are more cost effective, Llama models offer some of the lowest cost per token in the industry, according to testing by [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/). And as Mark Zuckerberg [noted](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/), open source will ensure that more people around the world have access to the benefits and opportunities of AI, that power isn’t concentrated in the hands of a small few, and that the technology can be deployed more evenly and safely across society. That’s why we continue to take steps on the path for open access AI to become the industry standard. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3m898f8948tsv5t5vnt2vt5))
- This is where the Llama ecosystem can help. On day one, developers can take advantage of all the advanced capabilities of the 405B model and start building immediately. Developers can also explore advanced workflows like easy-to-use synthetic data generation, follow turnkey directions for model distillation, and enable seamless RAG with solutions from partners, including AWS, NVIDIA, and Databricks. Additionally, Groq has optimized low-latency inference for cloud deployments, with Dell achieving similar optimizations for on-prem systems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3m8awyj6rnyjawj5cve2kqj))
- We’ve worked with key community projects like vLLM, TensorRT, and PyTorch to build in support from day one to ensure the community is ready for production deployment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3m8b58mz03pqxd6sfa7x3vj))
- While this is our biggest model yet, we believe there’s still plenty of new ground to explore in the future, including more device-friendly sizes, additional modalities, and more investment at the agent platform layer.As always, we look forward to seeing all the amazing products and experiences the community will build with these models.
