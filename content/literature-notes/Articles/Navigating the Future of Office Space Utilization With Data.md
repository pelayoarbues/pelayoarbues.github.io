## Highlights
- Optimizing office space requires combining technology, strategic foresight, and ongoing adaptation. By focusing on these three building blocks and ensuring there is data available to make informed decisions, workplace managers can ensure that office environments are optimized, efficient, and where employees want to be.
  Because real estate is so expensive and occupancy levels are lower than ever, companies are seeking data to validate their investments to ensure they get it right. Businesses that take a data-centric approach to understanding the space they need—be it the number of square feet, workstations, private offices, or meeting rooms—will be much more likely to satisfy the needs of employees while getting a good return on investment from their real estate.

- This is where sensor data comes into play. Old ways of understanding occupancy, like manual headcounts or IP tracking, are being replaced by more advanced analytics based on Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data. Sensors provide a discreet, affordable, and scalable way to collect the data workplace strategists need to create well-functioning office spaces that are aligned with employee needs and preferences.
  The insight that comes from the sensor data allows businesses to easily understand how the workplace is used, highlighting occupancy on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, enabling the identification of trends and an analysis of how many workstations and meeting rooms are needed to support efficient work and to develop adaptable spaces that reflect the fluid nature of today’s workforce. By combining data from different sources, such as desk occupancy sensors, motion sensors, and network analytics, businesses can get a clear idea of the habits and preferences of employees and use that understanding to make smart decisions about office layout, flexible space, resource management, and cleaning and maintenance.

- **The Metrics That Matter** 
  **1. Desk Occupancy** 
  Monitoring the number of people at workstations helps us understand how many desks and square feet are needed for an efficient office floor.
  **2. Meeting Room Usage** 
  Understanding which meeting rooms are used when helps to plan for meeting spaces that adequately serve the organization’s collaborative needs.
  **3. Peak Times Utilization** Knowing how a space is used when occupancy is at its peak helps us plan for the space and resources required during high-usage periods. 
  **4. Spatial Flow 
  **Analyzing movement within the office makes it possible to identify and address congestion for better space planning. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j5zmkn83dwnzmmkjdcj7ewny))
