## Highlights
- I can’t remember having a goal. An actual goal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5evmekgwqr0t3yrxsw5e6z))
- I do things, I try things, I build things, I want to make progress, I want to make things better for me, my company, my family, my neighborhood, etc. But I’ve never set a goal. It’s just not how I approach things. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5evvt7n2jfxd4jtbkn8fmy))
- A goal is something that goes away when you hit it. Once you’ve reached it, it’s gone. You could always set another one, but I just don’t function in steps like that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5ew4k742nydztxga2hz8qk))
- I consider [Basecamp](http://basecamp.com), my current business, as one continuous line back from when I sold the first thing I ever remember making — a logo for $50 (which happened to be for [Andrei Heramischuk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreiherasimchuk)— who knew!). I was 16 or something like that at the time. I didn’t have a goal to make two logos, or to be able to charge $5000 for a logo. I just made logos. And then I made software. And then I made web sites. And now I make software again. No goals in the process that I remember. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5ewr2vpfqfz7j4d83a82t6))
