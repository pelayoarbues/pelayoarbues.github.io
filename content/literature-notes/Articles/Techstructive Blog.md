## Highlights
- [Feedparser](https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/) is a simple but powerful python package that can be used to extract information about a specific webpage or a publication with its RSS feed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h948xtgp4memdq2ceps5t4x4))
- By providing the RSS feed link, we can get structured information in the form of python lists and dictionaries. It can be basically used in a pythonic way to read RSS feeds, it is really simple to use and it even normalizes different types of feeds ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h948y3zn3fzs6h360k1xgpn7))
