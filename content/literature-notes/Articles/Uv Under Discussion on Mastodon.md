## Highlights
- . Jacob Kaplan-Moss kicked off this fascinating conversation about [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) on Mastodon recently. It's worth reading the whole thing, which includes input from a whole range of influential Python community members such as Jeff Triplett, Glyph Lefkowitz, Russell Keith-Magee, Seth Michael Larson, Hynek Schlawack, James Bennett and others. (Mastodon is a pretty great place for keeping up with the Python community these days.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7c6hsbn9k43m3gy59p3srrh))
- The key theme of the conversation is that, while `uv` represents a huge set of potential improvements to the Python ecosystem, it comes with additional risks due its attachment to a VC-backed company - and its reliance on Rust rather than Python.

- As enthusiastic as I am about the direction uv is going, I *haven't* adopted them anywhere - because I want very much to understand Astral’s intended business model before I hook my wagon to their tools. It's definitely not clear to me how they're going to stay liquid once the VC money runs out. They could get me onboard in a hot second if they published a "This is what we're planning to charge for" blog post. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7c6j2m95f70jh1hx45s3y7r))
- As much as I hate VC, [...] FOSS projects flame out all the time too. If Frost loses interest, there’s no PDM anymore. Same for Ofek and Hatch(ling).
  I fully expect Astral to flame out and us having to fork/take over—it’s the circle of FOSS. To me uv looks like a genius sting to trick VCs into paying to fix packaging. We’ll be better off either way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7c6jr175c7413dtjfekpkqw))
- Even in the best case, Rust is more expensive and difficult to maintain, not to mention "non-native" to the average customer here. [...] And the difficulty with VC money here is that it can burn out *all* the other projects in the ecosystem simultaneously, creating a risk of monoculture, where previously, I think we can say that "monoculture" was the *least* of Python's packaging concerns.

- Just dropping in here to say that corporate capture of the Python ecosystem is the #1 keeps-me-up-at-night subject in my community work, so I watch Astral with interest, even if I'm not yet too worried. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7c6k7vmc5fhs6bzpk1xfv8p))
- I'm reminded of [this note from Armin Ronacher](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/8/21/harvest-season/), who created Rye and later donated it to uv maintainers Astral:
  > However having seen the code and what uv is doing, even in the worst possible future this is a very forkable and maintainable thing. I believe that even in case Astral shuts down or were to do something incredibly dodgy licensing wise, the community would be better off than before uv existed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7c6m28z2yd8xnpmd334cqws))
- I'm currently inclined to agree with Armin and Hynek: while the risk of corporate capture for a crucial aspect of the Python packaging and onboarding ecosystem is a legitimate concern, the amount of progress that has been made here in a relatively short time combined with the open license and quality of the underlying code keeps me optimistic that `uv` will be a net positive for Python overall.
