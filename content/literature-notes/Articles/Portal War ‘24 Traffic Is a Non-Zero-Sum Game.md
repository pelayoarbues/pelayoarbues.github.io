## Highlights
- Homes.com appears to have solidified its place as the #2 portal in the U.S. market, without a corresponding decline in traffic at any other portal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s357b16xd13bfwa78apgek))
- **Why it matters**: Portal traffic appears to be a non-zero-sum game – traffic gained by one portal is *additive* and not coming at the expense of other portals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s35pv0qzhn2ac2s7ddvd0y))
- **CoStar’s traffic reporting** hasn’t been consistent – it has fluctuated between Homes.com and the entire residential network, and sometimes includes quarterly averages and other times specific months. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s37hmtdg5fndpn2zh36hzm))
- CoStar’s inconsistent reporting runs the risk of reducing trust in its traffic numbers, even when the underlying results are impressively real. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s37pr6hb5hja353yat2qfq))
- But traffic has unequivocally increased over the past year, punctuated by two periods of heavy advertising. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s380y088a6nbx567k0cbjt))
- **CoStar’s advertising spend** reached an all-time high in Q1 2024 – which directly corresponds to the recent traffic surge in February and March. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s388w96gwvdr5rfh4v9dpq))
- **The bottom line**: While Homes.com’s traffic increase is additive to the market and not affecting other portals’ traffic, that’s not to say it won’t affect their businesses.
  • Unlike website visits, there is a finite amount of transactions, commission dollars, and agents willing to spend money online; that’s a zero-sum game. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0s38qgmvwehydh1452dnj5n))
