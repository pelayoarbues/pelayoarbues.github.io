## Highlights
- In order to prioritize hiring for scenarios where it’ll do the most good, over the past year I’ve developed a loose framework for reasoning about what a given team needs to increase performance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsmgzzm1ffm5m98wkj65et1))

- When **falling behind**, the system fix is to hire more people until the team moves into treading water.
