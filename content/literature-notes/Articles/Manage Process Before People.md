- The traditional paradigm of a reporting manager that's constantly following up with their reports, conducting daily stand-up meetings, weekly 1-1s, and all other forms of intensive supervision, needs to be (mostly) replaced with an asynchronous, self-managing paradigm instead.

- we delegate the review of the work of new employees to mentoring peers. This distributes one of the key functions of management, ensuring the quality of the work, amongst the entire team, and keeps it reasonable by only having senior staff serve as mentors for a single mentee.

- But it is to say that these functions of management can be divorced from much of the other routine supervision work that fills the weeks of a manager under the traditional paradigm.
