## Highlights
- The company announced a successful seed extension round, led by prior investors [LiveOak Ventures](https://liveoak.vc/) and [7BC Venture Capital](https://www.7bc.vc/). The funding specifics were not disclosed, but it marks a significant step in Nada’s journey towards expanding its innovative real estate investment solutions. Nada’s innovative business model offers homeowners immediate liquidity by allowing them to sell a fraction of their home’s future equity. This equity is then pooled into Cityfunds, which offer both homeowners and investors a unique way to engage with real estate investments without the typical burdens of additional debt or monthly payments.
  The new funds will be utilised to enhance Nada’s existing product offerings, such as Cityfunds and Homeshares, and to expand their market reach. This injection of capital is expected to bolster the company’s infrastructure, necessary to support its complex and scalable investment products. Nada has been on a steady trajectory since its inception in late 2018, focused on unlocking the trapped wealth within residential real estate. This latest funding round not only reaffirms the faith of existing investors but also sets the stage for the next phase of growth under Steen’s leadership.
