## Highlights
- When a person takes ketamine, time can slow down. Their perception of their body might start to shift: limbs expand to be bigger, shrink smaller, or their physical form feels very far away. Noises distort, and they might see the world through a tunnel. The walls move slowly in and out, like a breathing chest. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqp3dkx3p9jb069qa3jw787q))
- Ketamine has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an anaesthetic drug since 1970, and it’s currently being researched for the treatment of several mental health conditions, such as depression. The FDA approved a ketamine derivative called esketamine for treatment-resistant depression in 2019. When taken at lower, subanaesthetic doses, ketamine is often called a ‘dissociative’ because it makes people feel out of touch with their bodies or environments.

- As ketamine has taken on a new role as a treatment for depression, the accompanying feeling of dissociation has often been characterised as an undesirable side-effect of treatment, says David Mathai, a psychiatrist in private practice in Miami who trained at the Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelics and Consciousness Research. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqp3en1yj6x2m5179psn6sdk))
- When Mathai first started working with ketamine-assisted therapy for depression, he says he was taught to see it as a treatment with rapid antidepressant effects because of how the drug interacted with brain receptors, not from the experiences the drug induced. But as Mathai observed more sessions, he began to wonder if researchers should be paying closer attention to the dissociation. ‘The more I started seeing patients’ experiences at different clinics, in different settings, the more it felt like we were missing this really big part of what ketamine did: the subjective, dissociative effects,’ he says.

- Generally speaking, clinicians talk about dissociation negatively. When people are continually disconnected from themselves and their surroundings, they can even be diagnosed with a dissociative disorder. A sense of detachment from the world around you, your memories, or physical sensations can be [unnerving and alienating](https://psyche.co/ideas/when-reality-slips-through-your-fingers-in-search-of-dissociation), and it’s associated with states such as anxiety, stress and trauma. People’s experiences on ketamine offer another, more provocative way to regard this state: there might be qualities of dissociation – those same feelings of disengagement with the self or body – that people enjoy or find value in. That feeling could be an important ingredient in why ketamine-assisted therapy helps with depression symptoms. There are more mild versions of pleasurable dissociative states that we all [encounter](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16530586/) on a daily basis in other contexts: flow states, sex, or getting lost in a good book or movie. In some cultures, people [experience](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18213511/) even extreme dissociation in positive ways.

- He described people who started to intensely crave the dissociated feeling from being hypnotised; he called it ‘*la passion somnambulique*’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqp3gn6fj5ehp78p2rscfgb6))
- **If I ask a friend how they are feeling and they** reply ‘I’m so dissociated,’ I would probably be concerned. I might follow up by asking what’s wrong, or assume they’re tired, sad or overwhelmed. In American psychiatry’s diagnostic system (the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* or *DSM*), dissociation is described as a disruption of cognitive functions that are typically integrated: memory, perceptual and sensory awareness, information-processing. Yet dissociation has a longer history that predates the current iteration of the *DSM*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqp3h6zw5w89y2t7y7rf3kr4))
- One of the earliest conceptions of dissociation comes from the French psychologist Pierre Janet. In the 1880s, he wrote about cases of ‘double consciousness’ when people underwent hypnosis, had hysteria, or participated in spirit possession or mediumship. In these states, they weren’t able to integrate their ‘ideas and functions that constitute personality’. If someone had a trauma early in life, Janet suggested, trauma would interfere with their process of having a more integrated sense of self – a dissociated structure of mind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqp3hpmnnzy8ph55gfz1nmk8))
- We can look to other cultures to see how there can be more alternative interpretations of dissociative states. Rebecca Seligman, a medical anthropologist at Northwestern University in Illinois, began to be interested in dissociation through [research](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9781137409607) on mediumship and spirit possession specifically in Brazil. In the Candomblé religion, dissociative experiences are thought of as part of spiritual life. With these cultural structures in place, when people feel dissociated, it’s expected or appropriate. People interpret dissociation as a disturbance by spirits called *orixás*, including a discontinuity of self, disconnection from the body, memory, responsibility and personal identity. Dissociation is seen as a person being in communion with the gods, and that their own consciousness is displaced by that of a powerful other being.

- ‘They have what we would think of as dissociative experiences, but ones that are very positively valued and experienced in very positive ways,’ Seligman says. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqp3k917djdqp0r2mzz34pvj))
- In 2006, Lisa Butler, a philosopher and psychologist at the University of Buffalo in New York, [argued](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0193953X05000870) that most dissociative experiences are, in fact, not pathological. Many altered states, such as meditation or religious trances, involve dissociation. Also: daydreaming, fantasy and absorption. When I go to a hot yoga class, scroll TikTok, pick up a new book or start a Netflix show then, according to Butler, I am choosing to dissociate because I’m taking a minibreak from my thoughts or body. Butler considered non-pathological dissociative states to be any departure from an integrated bodily or sensory experience. This could include getting lost in a novel, watching an engrossing movie, having sex, or flow states, as described by the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi: ‘a state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqp3ktzqfs3596ep9z0kve97))
- I enjoy tapping into flow states – becoming so engrossed in researching a new topic, or weeding in my community garden – that I lose sense of time, my body and my identity for a short while. Butler wrote that we seek out non-pathological dissociative experiences because they are pleasurable, and they take us out of our everyday selves. There are many more mundane episodes of dissociation we all experience regularly, such as ‘highway hypnosis’, when people drive on their usual commutes, and then realise later they don’t remember most or any of their journey. All these everyday instances of dissociation are, of course, fleeting, and we can usually snap out of them whenever we choose; we have a sense of control over them. But what they show is that the feeling of dissociation itself often isn’t distressing all on its own. Dissociation [happens](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5156567/) to all of us on a continuum, and is ‘maybe a value-neutral mechanism that we all have,’ Seligman says.

- Before taking ketamine with his psychiatrist, the writer Steven Petrow read in his consent forms that the possible side-effects might include a ‘loss of sense of self’ or ‘changes in the perception of time’. ‘In looking back I realise I didn’t fully appreciate what all that meant,’ Petrow wrote in an essay about his experience in *The Washington Post* in 2023. During each session, he couldn’t locate his body in space, or his doctor. ‘I experienced disequilibrium,’ he wrote. ‘Imbalance. Unable to find my place. Somewhere between scary and terrified.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqp3nejyez6ckd6cmeqqn7s9))
- When we consider how dissociation can feel enjoyable in other contexts, there’s a shorter distance to travel to understand how the experience of ketamine might offer a timeout from the ordinary state of mind. Garrett Deckel, the late assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, provided ketamine-assisted therapy; people had told her dissociation was helpful because it put distance between them and their feelings. ‘What my patients tell me is that one way that ketamine is helpful is because there is a buffer that it provides,’ Deckel told me. ‘Precisely because it does disconnect them somewhat from their feelings, they’re able to approach their feelings.’ If someone has recurring negative thoughts about not being good enough, or that life doesn’t matter, those thoughts become less important, less foregrounded in the dissociative state.

- Recognising that people may enjoy, seek out or derive therapeutic pleasure from dissociative states is also crucial to appreciating ketamine’s addictive potential. People can build a physical tolerance to ketamine, needing higher doses to arrive at the same sensations – but they can also become psychologically dependent on the feeling of dissociation. For her article on ketamine’s addictive potential for *Business Insider* in 2023 , the journalist Anna Silman spoke to a woman named Nadia, a physician in New York, who developed a dependence on ketamine, doing it daily and at home alone. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqp3s4wsf08t172krx4an5bf))
- ‘Nadia was particularly drawn to the feeling of the k-hole, the dissociative high that comes from taking a large dose of ketamine,’ Silman wrote. ‘It’s like the fourth dimension that nobody can see but everybody knows is there,’ Nadia told Silman. ‘It feels like an escape where you’re totally at peace.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqp3sqsmpw082vzzys0cywea))
- Gaining a broader understanding of dissociation through a drug like ketamine doesn’t mean concluding that dissociation is all good, or all bad – just that it is powerful and warrants attention. Seligman cautions that cultural containers are powerful. It may be difficult for extreme dissociation to be experienced positively by everyone, because of ideas about how the ‘self’ is supposed to feel. In Euro-American contexts, the self is thought of as autonomous, integrated, unitary and coherent. When people unwillingly leave their usual state of consciousness, without choosing to do so, and experience a self that isn’t as coherent as it’s ‘supposed’ to be, it can be unnerving. ‘We live in a context in which more intense dissociative experiences have been framed as negative for a really long time,’ Seligman says. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqp3tb84sr0048573yd3yyga))
- But as ketamine clinics continue to open around the United States, Mathai wonders if there isn’t a missed opportunity to prepare people for dissociation in a way that could provide deeper psychological benefit, and offer warning for those who might enjoy this state too much. While some people could be helped or frightened by the dissociation in therapy, others are inexorably drawn to it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqp3twhcemrnpyjd7tg320c3))
