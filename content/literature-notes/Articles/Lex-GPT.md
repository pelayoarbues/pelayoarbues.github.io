## Highlights
- I built an [app](https://lex-gpt.fly.dev/) for question-answering over the full history of Lex Fridman podcasts. It uses [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) for audio-to-text followed by [Langchain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for dataset processing and embedding. It uses Pinecone to store embeddings and Langchain vectorDB search to find relevant podcast clips given a user question. It uses UI elements inspired by [Mckay Wrigley](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley)’s work. Code is [here](https://github.com/PineappleExpress808/lex-gpt).

- Split size has a strong influence on performance. To quantify this, I take the Karpathy podcast episode and use Langchain QAGenerationChain to generate an eval set. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzxx0gsqaqqh8s0st5a8b72d))
