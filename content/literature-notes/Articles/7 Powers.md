## Highlights
- 7 Powers is arguably the best book on business strategy currently available today. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htdj2fqc4m6xh42e55vdpg3g))
- This is a summary of a ðŸŒ³ [tree book](https://commoncog.com/the-3-kinds-of-non-fiction-book/#treebooks), arguably the best book on business strategy currently available. 7 Powers is **very** good, remarkably well written, but deceptively easy to read; the framework that the book develops is â€˜simple without being simplisticâ€™. To my mind, 7 Powers supplants Michael Porter, shores up several holes in Clayton Christensenâ€™s disruption theory, outshines Bruce Greenwaldâ€™s Competition Demystified, and makes Richard Rumelt look like a child playing with strategy toys. If you must read only one book on business strategy, make it this one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htdj2s5ekv968tkvg8bjrht3))
- The central problem that business strategy is supposed to solve is easy to state: how do you prevent your business from sucking? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htdj383dtt8kyrrhr2das062))
- Most businesses in most industries eventually suck. Weâ€™ve already covered the fundamental reason why: the short â€” if simplistic! â€” answer is â€˜[because competitive arbitrage](https://commoncog.com/competitive-arbitrage/)â€™ â€” good businesses have high profit margins; high profit margins attract competitors and copycats who are willing to reduce prices; over time, the increased pressure from competitors drives prices and margins down to the opportunity cost of capital.

- The question business strategy is supposed to answer is â€˜how do you prevent that from happening?â€™ In the absence of strategy, the simple â€” if naive â€” answer is to run harder and innovate better and work longer hours than your competition. But then itâ€™s only a matter of time before you (or one of your successors) trip up. A better answer is to find a â€˜moatâ€™; some â€¦ *thing* that helps you run less hard and work less hours, while still maintaining your profit margins.

- Helmerâ€™s book proposes there are really only seven types of moats. He calls these moats â€˜powersâ€™, because it literally gives you Power against margin compression ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htdj4e07f67zkp63b0nbbcz3))
- That last bit is why I think *7 Powers* is the best book on strategy available today â€” simply put, Helmerâ€™s theory is pragmatic. He recognises that business operators rarely discover Power through thoughtful analysis; they nearly always discover it through action. And so the contribution of *7 Powers* is that it helps you recognise sources of power when you see them; Helmer has said that the usefulness of *7 Powers* lies in the fact that it turns strategy into a â€˜multiple choice question, not an essay questionâ€™. His hope is that you would use his theory to make your trial and error cycles more deliberate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htdj5911z0j32faxgkdhkz16))
