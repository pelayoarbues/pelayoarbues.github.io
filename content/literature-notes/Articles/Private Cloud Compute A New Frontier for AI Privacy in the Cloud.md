## Highlights
- The goal with PCC is to allow Apple to run larger AI models that won't fit on a device, but in a way that guarantees that private data passed from the device to the cloud cannot leak in any way - not even to Apple engineers with SSH access who are debugging an outage.

- This is an extremely challenging problem, and their proposed solution includes a wide range of new innovations in private computing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j04ew2a3e1x4jtv43z4tvnym))
- The most impressive part is their approach to technically enforceable guarantees and verifiable transparency. How do you ensure that privacy isn't broken by a future code change? And how can you allow external experts to verify that the software running in your data center is the same software that they have independently audited? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j04ew5b1qwcnqd04c5nxa9ry))
- When we launch Private Cloud Compute, weâ€™ll take the extraordinary step of making software images of every production build of PCC publicly available for security research. This promise, too, is an enforceable guarantee: user devices will be willing to send data only to PCC nodes that can cryptographically attest to running publicly listed software.
