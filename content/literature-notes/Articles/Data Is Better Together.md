## Highlights
- Data continues to be essential for better models: We see continued evidence from [published research](https://huggingface.co/papers/2402.05123), open-source [experiments](https://argilla.io/blog/notus7b/), and from the open-source community that better data can lead to better models. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5h3mkgatdy6w0aaq0g2v9h))
- Empowering the community to build and improve datasets collectively will allow people to:
  • Contribute to the development of Open Source ML with no ML or programming skills required.
  • Create chat datasets for a particular language.
  • Develop benchmark datasets for a specific domain.
  • Create preference datasets from a diverse range of participants.
  • Build datasets for a particular task.
  • Build completely new types of datasets collectively as a community. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5h4rgtacdkf2h846z8nnea))
- One of the challenges to many previous efforts to build AI datasets collectively was setting up an efficient annotation task. Argilla is an open-source tool that can help create datasets for LLMs and smaller specialised task-specific models. Hugging Face Spaces is a platform for building and hosting machine learning demos and applications. Recently, Argilla added support for authentication via a Hugging Face account for Argilla instances hosted on Spaces. This means it now takes seconds for users to start contributing to an annotation task. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5h53hgzv5pbxq1mjnm4z0r))
