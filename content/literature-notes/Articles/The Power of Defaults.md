## Highlights
- This essay isn’t about network effects per se. It’s about the end state that they can enable: **Defaults**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpkjnxmr4w6env3vkmev57p7))
- Network effects can be broadly divided into three different categories: Direct, indirect and data network effects. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpkjp8xwzfm72yb6edkhkxtb))
- **Direct network effects** – as the name suggests – occur when the number of users has a direct impact on the value of a product. A telephone, for example, is worthless if you are the only person who owns one. But with every additional user who joins the telephone network, the number of people you can have a conversation with goes up and therefore the overall value of a telephone increases. The same dynamic is true for chat apps, social networks and p2p payment systems.

  **Indirect network effects** are a little more complicated. They occur in two-sided (or multi-sided) products where the size of one user group affects how valuable the product is to another user group. Operating systems are an often cited example here: The more users an OS has, the more attractive it becomes for developers. More developers and apps, on the other hand, make the platform more valuable for users, thereby generating a positive feedback loop between the two sides.
  The third category, **data network effects**, describes products which become better with more users via the data those users generate. Waze is a popular example of this category as are products that are powered by machine learning. More users lead to more data which lead to better recommendations or predictions and, thus, a better user experience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpkjpm4mxa9s8ebfffbtzg7h))
- The world’s most successful companies all exhibit some form of structural competitive advantage: A defensibility mechanism that protects their margins and profits from competitors over long periods of time. Business strategy books like to refer to these competitive advantages as “economic moats”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpkjmcffq7p0vaj50z14ph7h))
- One of the [most cited](https://www.nfx.com/post/network-effects-bible/) [types](https://a16z.com/2016/03/07/network-effects_critical-mass/) [of](https://a16z.com/2018/12/13/network-effects-dynamics-in-practice/) [moats](https://breadcrumb.vc/) is the concept of [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect). Network effects occur when the value of a product or service is subject to the number of users. A positive network effect means that a product or service becomes more valuable to its users as more people use it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpkjmgq98ncmmyegp5ytfqc5))
- Network effects are extremely hyped and have become a bit of a meme in recent years among tech entrepreneurs, investors and policy makers. The five largest companies by market cap in the US all seem to be built on some sort of network effect and some even go so far as to claim that [70% of tech value creation since 1994 is predicated on network effects](https://www.nfx.com/post/70-percent-value-network-effects/).
