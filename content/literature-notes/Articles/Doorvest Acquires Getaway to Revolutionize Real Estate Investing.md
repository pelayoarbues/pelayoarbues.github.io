## Highlights
- Doorvest, a full-service real estate investing platform that helps busy working professionals own passive income rental homes, today announced the acquisition of Getaway, a PropTech company that helps real estate investors find and finance investment properties. Through this acquisition, Doorvest will now be able to offer customers a truly end-to-end experience with the launch of Getaway’s financing products. The combined forces of Doorvest and Getaway create a vertically integrated, all-in-one platform for sourcing, financing, transacting, and managing investment properties.
  “The two companies have gotten to know each other as partners and friends which gave me a front-row seat at watching Ali and the Getaway team build phenomenal financing products. These products have armed real estate investors with the tools to expand their portfolios and we’re eager to offer this to current and future Doorvest customers,” said Andrew Luong, CEO and co-founder of Doorvest. “By uniting Doorvest’s end-to-end platform with Getaway’s innovative financing tools, we’re accelerating our mission to advance financial security for all while ushering in PropTech 3.0. With the addition of financing capabilities, we’ll further streamline every step of the investment journey and provide our customers with a seamless and fully integrated experience that empowers them to achieve their financial goals.”
  The merger accelerates the development of Doorvest’s upcoming lending product, slated to launch later this year. With the integration of Getaway’s investment sourcing technology and extensive network of over 34,000 investor customers, Doorvest is poised to become the go-to platform for Americans aspiring to build wealth through real estate.
