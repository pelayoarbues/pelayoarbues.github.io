## Highlights
- In the world of popular psychology, the work of one giant figure is hard to avoid: Carl Jung, the onetime associate of Sigmund Freud who died more than 60 years ago. If you think you have a *complex* about something, the Swiss psychiatrist invented that term. Are you an *extrovert* or an *introvert*? Those are his coinages, too. *Persona*, *archetype*, *synchronicity*: Jung, Jung, Jung. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw119neesp7k44bw09d0q0gp))
- When it comes to happiness, though, Jung can seem a bit of a downer. “‘Happiness,’” he wrote, “is such a remarkable reality that there is nobody who does not long for it.” So far, so good. But he does not leave it there: “And yet there is not a single objective criterion which would prove beyond all doubt that this condition necessarily exists.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw119rqv2mhvckz56fgvq5ps))
- Clearly, this observation should not discourage any serious student of happiness. On the contrary, Jung is stating the manifest truth that we cannot lay hold of any blissful end state of pure happiness, because every human life is bound to involve negative emotions, which in fact arose to alert us to threats and keep us safe. Rather, the objective should be progress—or, in the words of Oprah Winfrey, my co-author on our recent book, [*Build the Life You Want*](https://bookshop.org/p/books/build-the-life-you-want-the-art-and-science-of-getting-happier-arthur-c-brooks-oprah-winfrey/20032551?ean=9780593545409), “[happierness](https://www.harbus.org/post/seeking-happierness-and-embracing-the-ups-and-downs-of-life-with-oprah-winfrey-and-arthur-brooks).” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw11agyp0dp8xzc37gy6rasv))
- Jung believed that making progress toward happiness was built on five pillars. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw11b1za1nb42h9q92yq6gmx))
- **1. Good physical and mental health** 
  Jung believed that getting happier required soundness of mind and body. His thesis is supported by plenty of research. For example, the longest-running study of happiness—the Harvard Study of Adult Development—has [shown](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11384887/) that four of the biggest predictors of a senior citizen’s well-being are not smoking excessively, drinking alcohol moderately if at all, maintaining a healthy body weight, and exercising. Even more important for well-being is good mental health. Indeed, one study from 2013 [showed](https://ssrn.com/abstract=2336397) that poor mental health among Britons, Germans, and Australians predicted nearly two to roughly six times as much misery as poor physical health did. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw11bxbhwf0ncc9vmppcppap))
- This raises what might seem like a nitpick with Jung’s contention: Good health practices seem not to raise happiness, but rather to lower *un*happiness. Today, many emotion researchers have uncovered evidence of a phenomenon that Jung did not conceive of: Negative and positive emotions appear to be [separable](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/01/psychology-of-mixed-emotions-feelings-meaning-examples/672758/) phenomena and not opposites; well-being requires a focus on each. Furthermore, researchers have [identified](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-21771-001) how activities such as physical exercise can interrupt the cycle of negative emotion during moments of heightened stress, by helping moderate cortisol-hormone levels. I have found in my own work that this helps explain why people with naturally low levels of negative emotion tend to struggle with staying on a regular exercise regimen: They may feel less benefit to their well-being from going to the gym than people naturally higher in negative feelings do.

- **. Good personal and intimate relations, such as those of marriage, family, and friendships** 
  The intertwined notions that close relationships are at the heart of well-being and that cultivating them will reliably increase happiness are unambiguously true. Indeed, of the [four best life investments](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/04/how-increase-happiness-according-research/609619/) for increasing personal satisfaction, two involve family and friendships (the others are in faith or philosophy, and meaningful work; more on these in a moment). And as for marriage, an institution that has [taken a beating](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/07/marriage-divorce-rates.html#:~:text=Both%20the%20marriage%20and%20divorce,per%201%2C000%20women%20in%202011.) over recent decades, more and more evidence is piling up from scholars that being wed makes the majority of people happier than they otherwise would be, as the University of Virginia sociologist Brad Wilcox has argued. This research seemed so conclusive to Wilcox that he titled his recent book, simply, [*Get Married*](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/get-married-brad-wilcox). Jung himself was married to his wife, Emma, for 52 years, until her death at the age of 73. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw11h142xa9tfa2q1h4w6x8w))
- **Seeing beauty in art and in nature** 
  Jung believed that happiness required one to cultivate an appreciation for beautiful things and experiences. Although this might sound intuitively obvious, the actuality is more complicated. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw11jcc3rh4zd3j0jc38tpzp))
- Long before I focused my scholarly life on happiness, I was dedicated to art and beauty. My earliest memories are of painting with my artist mother; I learned to read music before written language; I made my living as a classical musician from ages 19 to 31. News flash: Artists are generally not the world’s most blissfully satisfied people. In a [1992 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/019188699290021G) from Britain, researchers found that performing artists reported depression at higher rates than the control group. At some point, I will write a book not on the *art of happiness* but on the very troublesome *happiness of art*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw11k15jn629n3q91ezekgmc))
- Among nonartists, however, the issue is somewhat simpler and in line with Jung’s thinking. First, a big difference exists between beauty in nature and beauty in art. Specifically, engagement with nature’s beauty [is known](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/eco.2017.0008), across different cultures, to enhance well-being. Second, with aesthetic experience, happiness depends on the artistic mood. For example, experiments have [shown](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10339-017-0832-7) that if you listen to happy music on your own, it makes you feel happier; if you listen to sad music while alone, it makes you feel sadder.

- **4. A reasonable standard of living and satisfactory work** 
  As with physical and mental health, employment and income seem tied more to eliminating unhappiness than to raising happiness. For one thing, scholars have long shown that unemployment is a reliable source of misery: Depressive symptoms [typically rise](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032717326319?casa_token=scwsW_9TnhsAAAAA:-Z-YyYn8Vx9tAWNQzeTG4JNJ3pVjXdf3A1I8jrNQzg54N6hmqz7Q7FHzK7RGF-puOsoxZN0) when people, both men and women, are unemployed. This cannot be explained simply by the lack of material and social resources that typically accompanies joblessness; rather, work itself helps protect mental health. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw11kzphfxgxxvjayh04s9qg))
- But if we can upgrade “satisfactory work” in Jung’s list to “meaningful work,” then positive gains in happiness do come into play. The [two elements](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/10/prioritizing-happiness-before-success/671714/) that make work meaningful for most people are *earned success* (a sense of accomplishing something valuable) and *service to others*. These can be achieved in almost any job. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw11s16he05cqmryzgdmsqyr))
- The relationship between money and happiness is a hotly contested topic; older studies [show](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1011492107) that well-being tops out at relatively low income levels, but more recent studies [show](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2016976118) that such contentment continues to rise for much higher incomes. My own [assessment](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/04/money-income-buy-happiness/618601/) of the evidence is that money alone cannot buy happiness, nor can spending money to acquire possessions make one happy; but having the money to pay for experiences with loved ones, to free up time to spend on meaningful activities, and to support good causes does enhance happiness.

- **5. A philosophical or religious outlook that fosters resilience** 
  Jung argued that a good life requires a way of understanding why things happen the way they do, being able to zoom out from the tedious quotidian travails of life, and put events—including inevitable suffering—into perspective. The son of a pastor, Jung was deeply Christian in his worldview, as his own words [published](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1963/01/jungs-view-of-christianity/658592/) many years ago in *The Atlantic* make clear: “For it is not that ‘God’ is a myth, but that myth is the revelation of a divine life in man.” He did not insist that his spiritual path was the only one—“I do not imagine that in my reflections,” he wrote, “I have uttered a final truth”—and allowed that even a nonreligious, purely philosophical attitude could do. But everyone, he thought, should have some sense of transcendent belief or higher purpose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw11vndc2wm49xdyap10n6rn))
- Research clearly [backs up](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/10/what-transcendent-experiences-do-your-brain-religion-spirituality/671883/) Jung’s contention. Religious belief has been noted as strongly predictive of finding meaning in life, and spirituality is positively correlated with better mental health; both faith and spiritual practice seem protective against depression. Secular philosophies can provide this benefit as well. Recent papers on [Stoicism](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/2/474), for example, have demonstrated that this ancient way of thinking and acting can yield well-being [benefits](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-30025-8_51.pdf). Many books have been written on the subject, including the psychotherapist Donald Robertson’s [*Stoicism and the Art of Happiness*](https://bookshop.org/p/books/stoicism-and-the-art-of-happiness-practical-wisdom-for-everyday-life/18918161?ean=9781473674783)*.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw11wh0ds1fzwn2g6aw6shpx))
- > . Do not fall prey to seeking pure happiness. Instead, seek lifelong progress toward *happierness*. 
  > 2. Manage as best you can the main sources of misery in your life by attending to your physical and mental health, maintaining employment, and ensuring an adequate income. 
  > 3. If you’re earning enough to take care of your principal needs, remember that happiness at work comes not from chasing higher income but from pursuing a sense of accomplishment and service to others. 
  > 4. Cultivate deep relationships through marriage, family, and real friendships. Remember that happiness is love. 
  > 5. If you have discretionary income left over, use it to invest in your relationships with family and friends. 
  > 6. Spend time in nature, surround yourself with beauty that uplifts you, and consume the art and music that nourish your spirit. 
  > 7. Find a path of transcendence—one that explains the big picture in life and helps you comprehend suffering and the purpose of your existence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw11x54nef61jyvpp2zam7ym))
