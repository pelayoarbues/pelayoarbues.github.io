## Highlights
- present Diffusion Classifier: strong classification results with pretrained conditional diffusion models, *with no additional training*! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb96mv79e5ewcajpxta1rxdq))
- Diffusion Classifier approximates the learned p(img | class) with the ELBO. This consists of adding noise to the image and using the diffusion model conditioned on each class to predict the noise. We find p(class | img) with Bayesâ€™ rule to determine the most likely class. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb96n2h0m9wf9c6q6styz0c3))
