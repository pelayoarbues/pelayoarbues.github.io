## Highlights
- Anthropomorphism is the act of projecting human-like qualities or behavior onto non-human entities, such as when people give animals, objects, or natural phenomena human-like characteristics or emotions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz4rwf85xj81ka4hdmy65g9x))
- “My apologies, but I won’t be able to help you with that request.” The simple alternative of “GPT-4 has been designed by OpenAI so that it does not respond to requests like this one” would clarify responsibility and avoid the deceptive use of first person pronouns. In my world, machines are not an “I” and shouldn’t pretend to be human. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz4ryf4dtz38d2rm023y1ppj))
- There are many accounts of created beings that take on a form of awareness or agency, from the historical golem (not the Tolkien one, called “gollum”) to Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley and all the way back to the myth of Pygmalion and Galatea.

- Second, we are just now exploring what it means for an algorithm to be a non-determinate conversational partner. The LLMs are, I agree, stochastic parrots, and hence “mind”-less. Nonetheless, they have a convincing social presence ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz4s021c7byn89aafpdh4n05))
- I suspect that we will need to break down our human / non-human binary into a dimension, or into multiple dimensions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz4s0k9rnrm5kwck54gsb3k1))
- Elizabeth Phillips and colleagues (2016) have explored the deeper relationships that we have with some animals, with dogs being the primary example of a social presence. See also Haraway’s (2003) concepts in companion species, and intriguingly Fijn’s (2011) work on human relationships with Mongolian lasso-pole ponies.

- would support strict regulations to protect people from AIs that are feigning human-ness in order to fool people. To me, that is a separate set of concerns from how we explore new technologies, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz6ezqrg8rg1yr43w9hja528))
- It’s one thing for an ordinary artifact user to make human-like references for boats, cars, or Roombas, but I see it as a problem when designers use that language, resulting in poor product ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz6f0r73b56f2mzeyjb3cc4h))

- deadly design mistake was Elon Musk’s insistence that since human drivers used only eyes, his Teslas would use only video. By preventing the use of radar or LIDAR, over the objections of his engineers, he has designed a suboptimal system that produces deadly results. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz6f1fk3t77vmqndmv0d1p55))
- metaphors matter (Lakoff & Johnson, 2006), so designers should be alert to how their belief that computers should communicate in natural language, just like people do, lead to their failure to use computer capabilities such as information abundant displays of visual information. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz6f298t97sd0wwwh7wx7q2v))
- Mumford describes how initial designs based on human or animal models are an obstacle that needs to be overcome in developing new technologies: “the most ineffective kind of machine is the realistic mechanical imitation of a man[/woman] or another animal.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz6f34wd7papfdc34b504tfm))
- Mumford’s point is that the distinctive capabilities of technology, such as wheels, jet engines, or high resolution computer displays may be overlooked if designers stick with the “bio-inspired” notions, such as conversational interfaces. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz6f3cv419vxfbbddsbnzhy4))
- it is understandable that anthropomorphic phrasing would be offered as an initial design for AI systems, but getting beyond this stage will enable designers to take better advantage of sophisticated algorithms, huge databases, superhuman sensors, information abundant displays, and superior user interfaces. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz6f45jfbpfhagdc24cddktm))
- How Can Humans Relate to Non-Human Intelligences?” For me, that is closer to the core issue, and anthropomorphism is a sub-question among many possible explorations of strange non-human entities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz6f5807enp9t0851zzr5x07))
- Anthropomorphism is one metaphorical approach to new ideas and new entities. In my view, metaphors become figures of thought, through which we can articulate some of that strangeness. (Following ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz6f5q9pjfwj52j8svcmqba5))
- while everyone is talking about LLMs and FMs, some of us (including you and I) are thinking hard about the UIs to those LLMs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz6f6e745c1jsnsbj6jwpnx8))
