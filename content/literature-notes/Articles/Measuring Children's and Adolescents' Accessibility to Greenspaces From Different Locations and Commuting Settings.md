- Document Note: This article introduces a novel method for measuring greenspace accessibility that takes into account access from different activity settings (i.e. homes, schools, and commuting), for children and adolescents, while accounting for the dependency of human access on the road network. Compared to conventional measures of greenspace accessibility, the results show that accounting for school and commuting settings in addition to residences captures previously untapped accessibility aspects. The article discusses four types of greenspace accessibility measures: travel cost, statistical index, buffer zone, and spatial interaction, and introduces the betweenness measure for greenspace accessibility. The study focuses on the three largest Dutch cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague), and calculates greenspace accessibility from home, educational facilities, and on-the-move from home to educational facility. The results suggest that measuring greenspace accessibility from educational or on-the-move settings often yields different scores relative to the ones calculated with conventional metrics, and provide new perspectives on greenspace accessibility.

## Highlights
- This article introduces a novel method to measure greenspace accessibility that considers access from different activity settings (i.e., homes, schools, and the commutes between them) for children and adolescents, while accounting for the dependency of human access on the road network.
