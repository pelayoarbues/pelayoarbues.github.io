## Highlights
- Over the last six months, we’ve launched our most capable models yet, including Gemini 1.5 Pro, and today we’re taking Gemini 1.5 Pro into public preview for our Cloud customers and developers. Gemini 1.5 Pro shows dramatically enhanced performance, and includes a breakthrough in long context understanding. That means it can run 1 million tokens of information consistently, opening up new possibilities for enterprises to create, discover and build using AI.

- When combined with Gemini’s multimodal capabilities (which can process audio, video, text, code and more), long context enables enterprises to do things that just weren’t possible with AI before. For example, a gaming company could provide a video analysis of a player’s performance, along with tips to improve. Or an insurance company could combine video, images and text inputs to create an incident report, making the claims process easier.
  We’re also expanding access to a new version of our open model Gemma, designed to help customers with code generation and other types of code assistance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1p3x9xwcp17zyq6e71ramy))
- Generative AI advances require strong underlying infrastructure. Our AI Hypercomputer combines our TPUs, GPUs, AI software and more to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models. Today, leading AI companies and Google Cloud customers like Anthropic, AI21 Labs, Contextual AI, Essential AI and Mistral AI are using our infrastructure.
  And now we’re announcing the general availability of TPU v5p, our most powerful, scalable and flexible AI accelerator for training and inference, with 4X the compute power of our previous generation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1p4jaz5mqnc40z8khd043g))
- Gemini for Cloud and cybersecurity
  We’re introducing new features that provide AI assistance to help customers work and code more efficiently, identify and resolve security threats, and more.
  Starting today, we’re upgrading Gemini Code Assist, which can generate and test code. One of the most exciting is the addition of Gemini 1.5 Pro (in private preview) — with the larger context window, it can deliver even more accurate code suggestions and deeper insights.
  We’re also providing more AI-driven tools to help organizations spot threats, summarize intelligence and take action against attacks. Gemini in Threat Intelligence, which is currently in preview, uses natural language to deliver deeper insights about how threat actors behave. Gemini’s larger context window enables us to analyze much larger samples of potentially malicious code and get more accurate results.

- We started to bring generative AI features to Google Workspace last year with “Help me write.” Today millions of people and businesses are using Gemini for Google Workspace features across Gmail, Docs, Sheets and more.
  We're now adding more enhancements to Gemini for Google Workspace across Gmail, Meet and Chat, and introducing Google Vids, an all-in-one video creation app for work that will sit alongside Docs, Sheets and Slides. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1p4vgfx8depm36ttp5ckkp))
- Another example is Uber, which is using AI agents to help employees be more productive, save time, and be even more effective at work. For customer service representatives, they’ve launched new tools that summarize communications with users, and surface context from previous interactions, so front-line staff can be more helpful and effective.
