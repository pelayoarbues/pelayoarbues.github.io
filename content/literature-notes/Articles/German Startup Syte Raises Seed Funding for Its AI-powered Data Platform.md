## Highlights
- Based on AI and in real time, syte already offers banks, estate agents, project developers, planners and authorities all the data and potential for any property – from property searches, construction potential and project calculations to energy and photovoltaic potential. The focus of the previous product is on the holistic digitalisation of the real estate sector at an early planning stage.
  The new product “syte Renovate” revolutionises renovation planning by calculating the optimal scenarios for each property without the need for time-consuming data input by the user. Pre-selected renovation measures can be modified to meet specific requirements, while cost restrictions, information on subsidies and savings as well as assessments of energy efficiency contributions help users to make optimal decisions. Sustainability thus becomes a relevant component in investment decisions. syte also makes it possible to create refurbishment roadmaps for entire property portfolios and to search for properties across Germany that can be refurbished particularly economically.
