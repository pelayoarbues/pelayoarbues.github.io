## Highlights
- Most data can’t be used for analytics and training machine learning models ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6f4vfvec1xacw7aqw958kwp))
- Most data has utility for digital use cases, but only data with context has utility for data and AI use cases. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6f4vxzhq4840ah5aee74gvr))
- A growing body of research supports the thesis that data quality and structure impact model reliability and generalization more than the quantity of data or model complexity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6f52a00dhx2ak0ebxh1kap6))
- Businesses that adopt a data and AI-centric approach to data engineering have faster delivery times and more opportunities to automate the data lifecycle/workflow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6f53fybb2620917qshchrwc))
- a data monetization catalog. It connects data sets and models to use cases. The data monetization catalog is my starting point for changing the assumption that all data is valuable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6f54q92vxmajxn43nj8zb0x))
- Just because data is used doesn’t mean that the data is a value creator. Usernames and passwords are common enterprise data types that support login functionality. For a login popup or screen, the digital functionality is the primary value creator, not the username and password. The data has digital utility and value.
