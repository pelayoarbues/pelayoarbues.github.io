## Highlights
- . Don’t ask AI, let AI ask youa) But I don’t know where to start
  Give ChatGPT an outline and let it write for you. Let’s turn the tables and have ChatGPT prompt *us*. Tell AI to ask you questions about what you’re writing. Push yourself to express in clear terms what you really want to say. Like this, for example:
  > I want to write [format] about [topic]. Ask me questions one at a time that force me to explain my idea. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja3v238yh6r9ze20n5a1qz76))
- Write for me: This is how AI is sold to us. But why write if you have nothing to say? Who would read it, and why?

  Ask me instead: Make AI ask *you* questions about your text. Copy-paste your answers. First draft done.
  Once you have enough to work with, paste *your* answers into your text editor. You have just written your first draft without cheating.
  ChatGPT may have asked or said some clever things along the way. Feeling tempted to steal it? Don’t. Rather use it as a chance to think and express what you feel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja3v3hnabxah0qqjmys58scr))
- . Don’t sell stolen goods—make your ownb) But I really like that ChatGPT sentence there
  *What if the ChatGPT generated something useful that I want to keep?* Paste it as a note *Marked as AI.* Use quotes, use markup, and note its origin. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja3v4k91n8fvndk5xmq0nv29))
- Don’t pretend. Createc) But I can’t say it better
  *What if Artificial Intelligence says exactly what I wanted to say?* Rethink and rewrite it to make it your own. Ask if what has been generated is really true. At first glance, it may look tight, but if you really think it through, you’ll find mistakes. Feel it, mean it, think it through. Say it your way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja3v4w3yd9wz7ntxycn2yvje))
- Continue working on your first draft by cutting and ordering your thoughts. Focus on what you want to say and get yourself into the flow. And you can forget ChatGPT for the next few hours. The story is yours now. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja3v532wqg3mcvkzhh5m8160))
- *Can’t find the right way to say something?* Tell ChatGPT to regenerate parts of your document, make it shorter and in the style of your favorite writer to help contrast your writing with somebody else’s. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja3v5hz9fmrm586x96xk9q40))

- *Worried you missed something obvious?* You can use ChatGPT as an editor to list potential flaws, like long words, clichés, or factual errors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja3v5wh4bk3wktw5cegynsnr))
- Use “list” rather than rewrite. Rewriting can lead to all sorts of unwanted changes. They can be hard to spot because ChatGPT seems so smooth, grammatically and orthographically. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja3v62avh6bh4xrpqe5x6ven))
- *But what if it’s really just commas or typos?* Then paste ChatGPT’s text over your own as edits. With Authorship enabled, iA Writer will show you what ChatGPT changed. This way you’ll make sure that it doesn’t rewrite things you said. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja3v6pnqr4geytwtdxdxx5n6))
- *What weaknesses have I missed in my writing?* Ask ChatGPT for progressively harsher critiques of your writing. That can be unpleasant, but that’s how you find and fix your blind spots, without the shame. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja3v6x194qjbgdchqsczmhgq))
- Enthusiasts present AI as a magic wand that can solve humanity’s biggest problems. In the meantime, it uses an exponential amount of energy to make everything the same. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja3v7pfm6n487hg8f4vfgkjh))
