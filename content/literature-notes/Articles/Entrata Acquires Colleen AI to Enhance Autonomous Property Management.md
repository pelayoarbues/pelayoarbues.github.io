## Highlights
- [Entrata](https://www.entrata.com/)®, a leading AI-enabled multifamily Operating System (OS), today announced its acquisition of Colleen AI, immediately furthering its ability to automate property operations. By incorporating Colleen AI into the Entrata OS, operators can take the next step towards autonomous property management, introducing a new era for the industry.
  Entrata’s vision of the future has Autonomous Property Management™ at its core, making workflows increasingly automated and portfolios more efficient while simultaneously delivering an elevated resident experience. With the unprecedented adoption of Entrata Layered Intelligence™ (ELI™), the acquisition of Colleen AI further bolsters AI capabilities across the Entrata OS.

- Through the acquisition of [Colleen AI](https://colleen.ai/), Entrata is introducing ELI+™, an elevated suite of AI products to power end-to-end workflows. ELI+ is for operators looking to harness the power of AI to transform their business through automation for even more efficiency. It’s designed to be modular and allows for swift enhancement utilizing modern AI and machine learning technology, giving operators the most up to date functionality. Operators will have immediate access to AI-powered collections and renewal modules, with additional modules, including leasing, in the coming months.

- Entrata’s new AI products sit across the OS to provide the ultimate automation, workflow management, and orchestration. There are thousands of data variables within the Entrata OS, and ELI+ leverages all of them to automate and contextualize every interaction — a clear advantage over other, non-native AI solutions. These data sources in Entrata are comprehensive and native to the OS to allow for high quality inputs. 
  This technology consolidation enables Conversational Context Switching™, which contextualizes each interaction through data and workflows for each resident, made possible by the single data source. For example, if a conversation begins for an amenity reservation, AI can easily satisfy the original request and then seamlessly shift the conversation to other priority tasks, such as beginning an early renewal process.
  In addition, by embracing an OS with a native AI layer, like ELI+, site teams don’t need to switch or become bogged down by disparate tech. Operating in one system that teams are f ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1pms8j1g36yt97wsq9eczde))
