## Highlights
- I’m guessing you *already* know that when you’re mentoring or coaching or managing someone, it’s important to bring lots of curiosity when you’re talking with them. This often looks like asking a bunch of good open questions, and then *actively listening* as the other person responds. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9h9c7pfy4nw3d73w3x29j5g))
- When I trained to become a coach through the Coach Training Institute, we learned about three levels of listening. I walk through these with my manager training attendees, to help them see the difference and begin to practice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9h9d83b4j4x7ypxa6md59j6))
- Level 1: Internal Listening
  Often, when we’ve asked a question and another person is responding, we are processing in our brain and getting ready to say the next thing: ask a follow up question, or provide some direction. This isn’t really listening. But we do it all the time!
  Level 1 listening is staying in your own head, processing how the information is relevant to you, how it might impact you, or what your own experience tells you about this thing they’re saying. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9h9dp2hbmyqxr0efesbwhk4))
- Level 2: Focused Listening
  In Level 2 listening, you’re genuinely focused on what the person is saying. You, to the best of your ability, block out all other thoughts going on in your brain. Level 2 listening is external to you; your own ideas don’t get in the way of hearing this person. You’re focused on the other person’s words and their meaning.

- Level 3: Global Listening
  In Level 3, you’re still focused on the other person, but you’re also aware of more things, like the person’s body language, tone, boredom, frustration, or their excitement. You’re aware of how they are reacting to you, or how they’re feeling. In group settings, Level 3 is the buzzing in the room when there’s lots of energy and enthusiasm, or quiet focus when the group is listening closely to a speaker, or when you can sense typing and distraction in the group.

- When you’re speaking with a teammate, aim to stay in Levels 2 and 3; you’ll be more effective at gaining a shared understanding, learning new information, supporting this other person, and making them feel seen and heard.

- Get comfortable with awkward silence.
  The natural outcome of active listening is silence.
  You’ve been listening intently, and paying attention to other signals like this person’s body language and tone. So when they’re finished talking, you’re going to need to switch your brain into processing mode—which means **awkward silence time** until you’re ready to say the next thing! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9h9g2kkj902kk1vzns118jx))
- **Silence does a lot of work**. Silence gives everyone in the room some more time to process and formulate thoughts. It creates an opening for others to participate (especially folks who aren’t comfortable interrupting or steamrolling others). It can communicate that you’re genuinely interested in hearing what others have to say. Silence and space are powerful tools in your management toolbox, and it’s time to get some practice creating them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9h9gdme5bghx5qg10jb0tqk))
- As you practice the skill of creating silence, watch for the effects it has on the people you’re talking to. What additional information do they end up providing? What questions do they start asking? How does their body language change during the silence? How much further do you get in your conversation? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9h9hnh1vwxayshq2vt02yzt))
- It can be really hard to come up with truly open questions on the spot. The best open questions prompt deep introspection and reflection, and I’ll be honest, it can be stressful to hone this skill in real time. So much pressure! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9h9hzcw7x9677hspzkq64e1))
- recommend coming up with a handy list of open questions you can ask in your one-on-one meetings. Some options to help you start this list:
  • Paloma Medina’s [Deeper Questions list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WWkvXQDhYcZoe_0Pcrmi9B19vmGJ8Uhtu4kMshDjkpk/edit) (Google Docs) which are great if you’re helping someone work through a conflict or amygdala hijack
  • My [First 1:1 Questions](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/) (blog post) which can help you get to know your direct report better
  • The [Plucky 1:1 Starter Pack](https://shop.beplucky.com/products/the-plucky-1-1-starter-pack) (card deck) lists handy coaching questions you can use in different one-on-ones, or leadership meetings, or team retreats—really anywhere! I love gifting these to new managers especially. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9h9jy5zwr6n931zv6ksas3j))
