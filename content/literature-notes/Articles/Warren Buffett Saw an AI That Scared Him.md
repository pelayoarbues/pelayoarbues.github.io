## Highlights
- In a [shareholder meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nWNeyeAYL8) over the weekend, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett admitted that he saw an AI doppelganger of himself that was so good, it impressed and terrified him.
  During a Q&A portion of the investor call, Buffett said that although he couldn't have explained how the deepfake was made, he was sure, from what he saw, that it's going to "be the growth industry of all time."
  "Based on the one I saw recently," the billionaire said, "I practically would send money to myself over and over in some crazy country." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxe3q3w5qwggkk8b5nqmpxv5))
- While it's unclear what deepfake of himself Buffett saw, there have been fairly recent reports about videos spoofing his likeness.
  As [*Media Matters* reported](https://www.mediamatters.org/tiktok/deepfake-warren-buffett-selling-bitcoin-scams-tiktok-users) in December, a video of the finance mogul taking to *Fox News* to promote to promote crypto — which he has quite publicly [come out against](https://futurism.com/the-byte/warren-buffett-bitcoin-crypto-scam) on [repeated occasions](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/22/bitcoin-is-rising-again-why-warren-buffett-remains-a-crypto-hater.html) — was indeed an AI fake.
  "I am watching a bitcoin giveaway take part [sic]," the spoofed Buffett said in the video, which has since been [flagged by Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6DlilIMvJU/) for being altered. "If you want to change your future, go to the website anloko.com, enter promo code 'gift' and enjoy your prizes, 0.3 BTC. Do not miss the opportunity that will change your life."
