## Highlights
- When ChatGPT came out, many people deemed it a perfect plagiarism tool. “AI seems almost built for cheating,” Ethan Mollick, an A.I. commentator, wrote in his book “[Co-Intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Co-Intelligence-Living-Working-Ethan-Mollick/dp/059371671X).” (He later predicted a “homework apocalypse.”) An agricultural-science professor at Texas A&M failed all his students when he became convinced that the whole class had used A.I. to write their assignments. (It turned out that his method of detection—asking ChatGPT whether it had generated the papers in question—was unreliable, so he changed the grades.) A columnist in *The Spectator* asked, “How can you send students home with essay assignments when, between puffs of quasi-legal weed, they can tell their laptop: ‘Hey, ChatGPT, write a good 1,000-word paper comparing the themes of *Fleabag* and *Macbeth*’—and two seconds later, voila?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9pw5a7hd0pnw6ky520apzfc))
- But “voilà” was not the word for whatever ChatGPT was doing for Chris. He was not outsourcing his exam to ChatGPT; he rarely made use of the new text or revisions that the chatbot provided. He also didn’t seem to be streamlining or speeding up his writing process. If I had been Chris’s professor, I would have wanted him to disclose his use of the tool, but I don’t think I would have considered it cheating. So what was it?

- I asked Chris to explain what he thought he was doing. “You could say that while my own role is a sort of orchestrator and guide, ChatGPT’s role is mainly the execution and supporting of the structure of my work,” he told me. This made sense in theory, but it didn’t seem to capture the chaotic transcript I had read. Chris then rattled off several additional contributions that ChatGPT had made to his process. He was struggling to explain how the tool had actually helped him; he seemed to lack the language to describe this new style of collaboration.

- For the writers Pigg studied and the students I interviewed for this article, ChatGPT was not so much a perfect plagiarism tool as a sounding board. The chatbot couldn’t produce large sections of usable text, but it could explore ideas, sharpen existing prose, or provide rough text for the student to polish. It allowed writers to play with their own words and ideas. In some cases, these interactions with ChatGPT seem almost parasocial. Chris told me that Chat—his nickname for ChatGPT—was a “good conversation partner.” Another student, who was [profiled in a recent paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461524000094) on the subject, nicknamed the chatbot Lisa and described “her” as “a partner and even a friend.” ChatGPT raises difficult practical issues about originality and plagiarism. But the binary question “Is it cheating?” hides the possibility that something new and inventive might be going on here. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9py4kdrwx82jkp9tjcvnw2z))
- Writing is hard. It requires us to use multiple parts of the brain in an improbable symphony of high-strain effort. Our hippocampus summons relevant facts; the prefrontal cortex tries to organize them. A brain region known as Broca’s area helps us to narrate in a familiar inner voice; our verbal working memory stores and manipulates the narration as we transfer it to the page. Meanwhile, our brain recruits our spatial working memory, which evolved to track our location in physical space, to orient our words within a whole. (In the lab, if you ask a person to trace a pattern with her free hand—a standard method to exhaust spatial working memory—her ability to structure an essay diminishes.)
