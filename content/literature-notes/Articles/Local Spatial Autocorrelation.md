## Highlights
- The degree of overlap can be visualized by means of a cardinality map (a special case of a unique values map), where each location indicates how many neighbors the two weights matrices have in common. In addition, different p-value cut-offs can be employed to select the *significant* locations, i.e., where the probability of a given number of common neighbors falls below the chosen p.
