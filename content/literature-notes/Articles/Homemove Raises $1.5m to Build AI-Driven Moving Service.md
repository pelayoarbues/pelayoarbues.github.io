## Highlights
- [Homemove](https://homemove.com/), a quiet rising star in the PropTech industry, has announced the close of a $1.5 million funding round, to re-imagine the way people move home. For home buyers and sellers who are currently mired in fragmented transactions, Homemove is a platform which brings everything together in a single place whilst leveraging innovative AI solutions at every part of the moving experience.
  Over the last 12 months, Homemove has rapidly grown its revenues and market share by offering customers a top-rated service. This success has attracted substantial interest amongst new and existing investors. As a result, the recent funding round diverged from typical seed stage raises: it was oversubscribed, drawing direct investments from angel investors and family offices without a lead Venture Capital investor.
  The platform is redefining the home moving process by integrating services such as estate agent valuations, mortgage comparisons, homebuyer surveys, conveyancing services, and removal bookings into a single, streamlined AI-driven digital experience which connects home buyers and sellers with the platform’s hand selected partners.
  The company currently collaborates with thousands of local, high quality independent partners, boosting their businesses by booking them directly with consumers through the scalable Homemove platform. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxgz2gnpbzdy3dndawtjc99k))
