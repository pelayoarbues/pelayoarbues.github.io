- Full Title: Don’t Build the Thing, Build the Thing That Builds the Thing!
- Document Note: Dev-GPT is an AI automation tool that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4 to build microservices. It replaces the traditional software development process with an AI-driven approach that eliminates tickets and scrums, so developers can focus on strategic questions that demand creativity. Dev-GPT generates microservices in minutes, saving time and reducing costs. Companies can bring new services online quickly in response to new needs and market changes.

## Highlights
- The focus of software development shifted from *building the thing we need*, to *building the thing that builds the thing we need*. The introduction of large language models moved software engineering to a higher level of abstraction ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4qnv3v8s3fmk94fm65cb6gn))
- The whole history of programming is a history of rising to higher levels of abstraction, letting software handle more and more of the details. As far back as the 1940s, assembly language abstracted from hand-coded 0’s and 1’s. Early programming languages abstracted from assembly language. Progressively higher-level languages took greater charge of the details that humans previously dealt with directly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4qnvfje67wk9jnpv7xsxxeh))
- Dev-GPT instantiates three AI agents:
  • **Product Manager**: The Product Manager interacts with you to clarify the requirements and make sure even the corner cases are well-defined.
  • **Developer**: The refined requirements are then handed over to the Developer agent, which writes code to implement the microservice, writes test cases, and debugs the code until the tests pass.
  • **DevOps**: Finally, the DevOps agent deploys the microservice and monitors it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4qnwjmyypy9q6w91jp85gw5))

- The way Dev-GPT uses AI models in programming signals a change of paradigm for software developers. It is a major break from traditional, labor-intensive coding processes. Instead, Dev-GPT deploys the power of the latest large language models to ensure that the microservices generated are robust and efficient ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4qnygxhfe6r4tze01jad9k4))
