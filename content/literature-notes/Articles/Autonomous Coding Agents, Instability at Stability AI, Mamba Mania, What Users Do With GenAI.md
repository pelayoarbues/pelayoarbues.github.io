## Highlights
- Planning is a key [agentic AI design pattern](https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW37MX7M6w0dW370nSM1tCLw8V_gMC15cML_ZN50kgPF3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3kPN8WTPV2yRZpmW5qgBrY80tNSNW82jMy57bZg_WW27MMdl59q72ZW4j8rRr4_Cf9bW4VHgbJ1dWcs-W8FF6NH5b40tgW7sJRfJ5-Sh0fW8zWgZ94wGzcHN7T2Rvw8CcYbW4g-CgG4vv9wvW33wyF95VlcffW3fhsNP9677BkW11brdP59sSX3W8-f0N23Rlx2pW1ZXhk047L3jRW4vxq4z4_cwnrN3smQnsbW3X7N8l3rQx15SlRW62T7X14KmH5FW6lmZ-k6WWFWvW7KGXWq11M1wdW5Xv5T12nHQHzW18fbr3759GMWW7j52-y6k2nr8W6K8BrK6LcPvSW7Pjgv95KrlcVW7t2Tsv8lkKs6d3lQ6j04) in which we use a large language model (LLM) to autonomously decide on what sequence of steps to execute to accomplish a larger task. For example, if we ask an agent to do online research on a given topic, we might use an LLM to break down the objective into smaller subtasks, such as researching specific subtopics, synthesizing findings, and compiling a report. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwnq56z4j01c25gpgftdm2ep))
- I had tested this agent multiple times privately, during which it consistently used a web search tool to gather information and wrote up a summary. During the live demo, though, the web search API unexpectedly returned with a rate limiting error. I thought my demo was about to fail publicly, and I dreaded what was to come next. To my surprise, the agent pivoted deftly to a Wikipedia search tool — which I had forgotten I’d given it — and completed the task using Wikipedia instead of web search. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwnq5cz9hdwhprhnc0j2ha4q))
- This was an AI Agentic moment of surprise for me. I think many people who haven’t experienced such a moment yet will do so in the coming months. It’s a beautiful thing when you see an agent autonomously decide to do things in ways that you had not anticipated, and succeed as a result! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwnq5mhjjbzgwtkp26kc95zf))
- Many tasks can’t be done in a single step or with a single tool invocation, but an agent can decide what steps to take. For example, to simplify an example from the HuggingGPT paper (cited below), if you want an agent to consider a picture of a boy and draw a picture of a girl in the same pose, the task might be decomposed into two distinct steps: (i) detect the pose in the picture of the boy and (ii) render a picture of a girl in the detected pose. An LLM might be fine-tuned or prompted (with few-shot prompting) to specify a plan by outputting a string like *"{tool: pose-detection, input: image.jpg, output: temp1 } {tool: pose-to-image, input: temp1, output: final.jpg}"*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwnq5yc70d1mj0wgfqws1xcn))
- This structured output, which specifies two steps to take, then triggers software to invoke a pose detection tool followed by a pose-to-image tool to complete the task. (This example is for illustrative purposes only; HuggingGPT uses a different format.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwnq6962gsjwac9047n00n3z))
- Admittedly, many agentic workflows do not need planning. For example, you might have an agent reflect on, and improve, its output a fixed number of times. In this case, the sequence of steps the agent takes is fixed and deterministic. But for complex tasks in which you aren’t able to specify a decomposition of the task into a set of steps ahead of time, Planning allows the agent to decide dynamically what steps to take. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwnq6c7tnt19nw5xe9ep688q))
- On one hand, Planning is a very powerful capability; on the other, it leads to less predictable results. In my experience, while I can get the agentic design patterns of [Reflection](https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW37MX7M6w0dW370nSM1tCLw8V_gMC15cML_ZN50kgPF3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3mYW74kMms1NW1qMW7pnbZF28Bq0JN7ZgktQFjfvjW5Y17N440stBZW8jK1Dg7g_DzDW78NcXq8G4xJhW4Z4KtJ2XkyhbW4jqy-L6tt1H3W3vJsZJ4YmQFpW4NJkth8MtWY4W5f8hC05hsBN8W3LYcft20Jf9vV5JHJM78KpyfW5klB746bryx1Vqn0Y32pJ-qcW7B6kc-5gVv5_W2Xzzrz4RP1L3F2zvs2TkPH4VXWcMD5tD4pQW5sz6bn3Y_-DyW4qWQjK35HpQbW6ZwkyH78VWLyW7zFRpD44GnC1VvVFXV7tYN5TVBJwX01wZK8hW4HvRzm6Q_ysSW3qllm07rNddSW1VMwH27TJkbQdt3yl804) and [Tool use](https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW37MX7M6w0dW370nSM1tCLw8V_gMC15cML_ZN50kgPF3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3l-W1ghvLT7Bv4KBW8PpzjG4xb046W8gJvLC50csPyW6q0ls05Ql2j1N8tycyGThW5HN8cW_S0B0FzrW5ZL-8G7nbQZLW4N_V4V6SPTyCW1WXjx76vqnDNW75s3Dc1XRbw9VGczSk25_vvwW4b9pTY1Q6T9FN26BWC6zhHLHVTySfS94bztXW4GgSGr62lbj7W26M8g388VfkBW5zjSBb5LDfDfW90N6qG6Jn-04W6XJgFV3glxgQW8wDwLl2ZvB1cW8H8J3p8MRbX3W5pTmVZ9cHc8LW3VKS5X1tgSN4VM1sF18yWRl-W92l3PG61Sdl0W7Zf3lg2bk0GwW2Q-3Np3xNkz7W3XLD4T5Jg4rYf4Gf7tq04) to work reliably and improve my applications’ performance, Planning is a less mature technology, and I find it hard to predict in advance what it will do. But the field continues to evolve rapidly, and I'm confident that Planning abilities will improve quickly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwnq6g4d604dg2m08j179qat))
- P.S. Making sure your RAG system has access to the data it needs to answer questions is an important, but often laborious, step for good performance. Our new short course “Preprocessing Unstructured Data for LLM Applications,” taught by Matt Robinson of Unstructured, teaches you how to build systems that can easily ingest data from a wide range of formats (like text, images, and tables) and from many different sources (like PDF, PowerPoint, and HTML). You’ll learn practical ways to extract and normalize content from diverse formats, enrich your content with metadata to enable more powerful retrieval and reasoning, and use document layout analysis and vision transformers to process embedded images and tables. Putting these components together, you’ll build a RAG bot that draws from multiple document types, demonstrating how high-quality data ingestion and preprocessing affect the quality of RAG output.

According to the Pew report, 20 percent of all Americans had used ChatGPT for work, and 17 percent had used it for entertainment, with younger and more educated users leading the way. 
  Why it matters: It’s clear that millions of people use generative AI but less clear how they use it. Understanding how and where they actually apply it is helpful for anyone who aims to develop new generative AI products and services or plans to integrate the tech into their organization.

- Structured State Space Sequence (S4) basics: [S4s](https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW37MX7M6w0dW370nSM1tCLw8V_gMC15cML_ZN50kgNM3qgyTW6N1vHY6lZ3kKW5LqKj078jdbpW8JQqpc12lrVZW4mpCHS7SxFtHN2t3nwJ6LqVrW97R1dx190cdQW5vgfcd6Hk4vqW8J0GHm82QRxyVQsq6G8B-R1qW4kGCFX78mm2qW4wJJcp5mdz2dW2N8PyH6NsJtJW1_ZPlz3zlsp0W5J8q5w93b-kBV5-m4f685k2cW3BggXk6XTH-BW32nn7Y53hnQxW9frBpd4jxmcJW6Sb3CP4Z200BW5B7LWJ4rsF_pW7CGRsq18NZMtW3c724J4s2qZLW1l9xkg8X47znf4kZ_xd04), also known as structured SSMs, can be functionally similar to recurrent neural networks (RNNs): They can accept one token at time and produce a linear combination of the current token and an embedding that represents all previous tokens. Unlike RNNs and their extensions including LSTMs — but like transformers — they can also perform an equivalent computation in parallel during training. In addition, they are more computationally efficient than transformers. An S4’s computation and memory requirements rise linearly with input size, while a vanilla transformer’s rise quadratically — a heavy burden with long input sequences. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwnqch3p4sa5n19z10a4420z))
- Key insight: S4s are more efficient than transformers but, while a transformer’s input length is limited only by processing and memory, an S4’s input length is limited by how well its hidden state can represent previously input tokens as new tokens arrive. A [gating mechanism](https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW37MX7M6w0dW370nSM1tCLw8V_gMC15cML_ZN50kgNM3qgyTW6N1vHY6lZ3lWW2YQ47173HKKqN5kQ-vxbjWJ4W1T5Dyl7V4byHVn6nZ-7bN9S2VZ9c3q5w85QyW5F4Khy5Fy3_FW1lVvLZ528k94W5-cj6d14v32nW2JXLcR5_qqZnW22BtlG3RRJbSW1f1mdH8NMwDlN3FfnQqZKrL1W1h4gsP12dR9xW1dlw-55DNVG9W3R8vYs4Gnj5GW3l25ZR98w5cYW774HKb2k7x5rW66lzQm3HPfZ-W3sdfCl7QPQXcW1JRckq1GPfstW985lc47jRmMbW71bylM3XnsnQf4vF_g804) that lets the model process the most important parts of an input and ignore the rest can enable it to process longer inputs. One viable gate: Typically S4s apply the same mathematical function to all input tokens, whose parameters consist of four learned matrices. Changing the matrices for each input enables the model to learn which tokens or parts of tokens are least important and can be ignored (set to zero). This condenses the input, enabling the modified S4 to process very long input sequences. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwnqcp4j03v6096371r9bb34))
