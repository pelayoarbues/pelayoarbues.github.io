## Highlights
- While having more data is helpful, large pretrained models make it practical to build viable systems using a very small labeled training set — perhaps just a handful of examples specific to your application. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1a1zw6137ztw0gqcnc4bjdq))
- With self-supervised learning, pretraining can happen on unlabeled data. So, technically, the model did need a lot of data for training, but that was unlabeled, general text or image data. Then, even with only a small amount of labeled, task-specific data, you can get good performance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1a20y66yw7ycd5j0k67zvvj))
- The 2010s were the decade of large supervised models, I think the 2020s are shaping up to be the decade of large pretrained models. However, there is one important caveat: This approach works well for unstructured data (text, vision and audio) but not for structured data, and the majority of machine learning applications today are built on structured data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1a22796sybsbfhtdb53cc45))
- diverse unstructured data found on the web generalize to a variety of unstructured data tasks of the same input modality. This is because text/images/audio on the web have many similarities to whatever specific text/image/audio task you might want to solve. But structured data such as tabular data is much more heterogeneous ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1a22t2qb69hjz02ga5g5ced))
- Why it matters: The EU is on the leading edge of regulating AI. As with many national-level efforts, Europe’s investigations into social media algorithms could reduce harms and promote social well-being well beyond the union’s borders. 
  We’re thinking: This is a welcome step. Governments need to understand technology before they can craft thoughtful regulations to manage it. ECAT looks like a strong move in that direction. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1a24j1km9pfa1fybsqw1ddg))
- We’re thinking: Custom models built by teams outside the tech sector are gaining steam. Bloomberg itself — which makes most of its money providing financial data — [trained](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17564?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=259713498&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9oC363_PJ6_iNNUmA0iCDVINuIwd2ug0s8F3MWDjxi3V2Q9QxIx3mmBe8WXTJglbCuqdlRiA04fiGl1_sWCBC-a1Njng) a BLOOM-style model on its corpus and found that it performed financial tasks significantly better than a general-purpose model.

- [TinyML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11267?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=259713498&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9oC363_PJ6_iNNUmA0iCDVINuIwd2ug0s8F3MWDjxi3V2Q9QxIx3mmBe8WXTJglbCuqdlRiA04fiGl1_sWCBC-a1Njng) shows promise for bringing deep learning to applications where electrical power is scarce, processing in the cloud is impractical, and/or data privacy is paramount. The trick is to get high-performance algorithms to run on hardware that offers limited computation, memory, and electrical power.
