## Highlights
- The real estate industry has long depended on human agents to match properties with potential buyers accurately. However, as markets expand and data proliferates, the need for more efficient and scalable solutions has become clear. By integrating AI-driven models with vector databases, we’re creating a digital agent that understands and responds to user needs with the precision and contextual awareness of a human agent—only faster and at a much larger scale.
  This project is not just about streamlining processes; it’s about transforming the entire industry. By automating and enhancing the property search and matching process, we’re empowering users with tools that make their property search experience more intuitive and satisfying. Picture a world where a digital agent can grasp your preferences, anticipate your needs, and guide you seamlessly through the complex real estate landscape. This is the future we’re building—a future that could redefine real estate transactions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6f3yed4x54zgkdhj8pk4n5c))
- This code is designed to simulate a conversation between a user and an AI-powered real estate expert to find properties that match the user’s specific requirements (and are stored in our database). The conversation begins with an initial prompt, which is structured according to the `system_template` that outlines how the AI should engage with the user. The AI then prompts the user with questions to gather information about their preferences. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6f3xsza0mdp97wev5teew7h))
- As the user responds, their inputs are processed, and the conversation continues until the AI detects an end sequence, indicating that all necessary details have been collected. Once this sequence is identified, the system retrieves relevant property data from a vector database (Qdrant) using the user’s last query. The top 5 matching properties are then processed into a format that the AI can use to generate a detailed response. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6f3zz1hap1gxhvqxea6v476))
- Our chatbot serves as a personal assistant that chats with you to gather all the information needed to find your ideal home. By asking relevant questions and collecting your preferences in a natural and interactive way, it ensures that the “HomeMatch” application can provide you with the best possible property matches. This approach simplifies the search process, making it easy and convenient for you to find your dream home. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6f3xkkhramvp51wa4wxsxy1))
