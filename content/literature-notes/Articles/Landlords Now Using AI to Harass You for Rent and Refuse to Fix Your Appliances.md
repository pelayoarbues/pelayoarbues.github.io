## Highlights
- It hasn't quite taken the real estate world by storm yet, but, as [*The New York Times* reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/business/ai-bots-property-managers.html), some property managers are using AI chatbots to handle the inquiries — and complaints — of their tenants, both existing and prospective ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1tdhvjx84awpf3xqv3sjbtr))
- Like any good landlord, these bot-barons also do the dirty work of harassing you to pay your rent — and whether it does that in the usual chirpy AI tone or a stern voice, is up to the client. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1tdj43ca52cfm0eyydk8k79))
- Such chatbots are provided by companies like EliseAI, based in New York, which serves the owners of some 2.5 million apartments across the US, according to the *NYT*. They're meant to be as humanlike as possible, CEO Minna Song told the newspaper — and are maybe a little too good at playing the part.
  "People come to the leasing office and ask for Elise by name," Song said. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1tdjke6g8r1h5e4kqg9ya9s))
- Some tenants aren't thrilled about their new intermediary overlords. For Ray Weng, a software programmer, it's made apartment-hunting even more soul-crushing than it already is. In many cases, he was forced to speak to an AI about renting a place, which would give vague and even repeated answers. Showing up in-person was no better: even the tours were self-guided.

- "I'd rather deal with a person," Weng told the *NYT*. "It's a big commitment to sign a lease." He added that "if it's all automated, it feels like they don't care enough to have a real person talk to me."
  At the very least, these AIs are on call 24/7. Gone are the days of getting ghosted by your landlord when there's a problem that needs fixing. On the other hand, a tenant might feel a little insulted, as in one example about EliseAI's capabilities *NYT* cited, when a bubbly chatbot simply sends them a video about how to find the water shut-off valve after complaining about leaky plumbing.

- An AI chatbot in any customer service role raises a bunch of thorny questions. What if it confidently tells a tenant wrong information, or makes a promise its human masters can't make good on? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1tdkm558434j5mc85rbemkx))
- "All things considered, it is better to have your bot announce at the beginning that it is a computer assistant," Alex John London, a professor of ethics and computational technologies at Carnegie Mellon, told the *NYT*.
