## Highlights
- Over time the world ceased to surprise me. I saw its machinations, and became increasingly unimpressed. I saw my own machinations, and became equally unimpressed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j18fkkfm30m5kqqy0ffyv5md))
- I thought becoming jaded was a natural part of growing up. Instead, becoming un-jaded is what happened when I finally did grow up, and it has *radically* improved my quality of life. It’s a revivification I think many parents experience (and is only [sometimes expressed](https://evashang.substack.com/p/a-case-for-reproductive-futurism)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j18fmftryne8qsejhqa78wrj))
- I write this, flirting with sappiness, because it’s become surprisingly easy to find prominent examples of parents arguing the exact opposite: that children have fundamentally worsened their lives. At least in that the “I regret becoming a parent, actually” genre of essay has become popular in high-profile outlets. Examples over the last few years include publications in *[Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephenlaconte/parents-who-dont-want-their-kids-reddit)*, *[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/08/why-parents-regret-children/619931/)*, *[TIME magazine](https://time.com/6966914/parental-regret-children-ro-kwon-essay/)*, *[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/common-reasons-people-regret-having-kids-2024-2)*, *[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/never-wanted-kids-moms-open-reasons-they-regret-children-1774075)*, *[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/regret-having-kids-abortion-roe-wade-b2123318.html)*, *[The Sydney Morning Herald](https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/having-a-kid-is-probably-my-biggest-life-regret-wife-concurs-20210525-p57v3b.html)*, *[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/11/breaking-taboo-parents-who-regret-having-children)*, etc. Many of the pieces in the genre have gone viral. E.g., the *TIME* piece from this year, “[The Parents Who Regret Having Children](https://time.com/6966914/parental-regret-children-ro-kwon-essay/)” was shared to the tune of [millions of views](https://x.com/rokwon/status/1782401451761037651) and included parents describing their new identities as “domestic gulag.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j18fmxqzw04m4zcsshryaa9y))
