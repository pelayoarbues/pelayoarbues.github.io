## Highlights
- Have you ever felt that parts of your life work against your natural instincts? Perhaps you commute to work in heavy traffic when you’d rather be walking. Or you’d love to enjoy more time with your children after school, but your boss won’t let you adjust your office schedule. Maybe you fear that spending more than 90 per cent of your time indoors and nine hours a day looking at screens of various sizes isn’t setting you up to live your best life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmmspm4kn1hc5t5hdz7e7cs))
- But I wasn’t seeing these benefits materialise, and I grew more miserable and unhealthy. Constantly fighting my instinct to direct my own actions, socialise with loved ones, and get outside eventually led to burnout. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmmtzw0gzyqkz8yz9w00nc8))
- I wasn’t alone. My peers were also sleep-deprived, anxious, self-medicating, and unable to enjoy the simple pleasures in life. Rates of stress-related illnesses and mental health problems were (and still are) increasing among my demographic. I grew sceptical about the supposed benefits of 21st-century technological progress that came at the cost of our physical and mental wellbeing. From my training as an anthropologist, I knew that most cultures throughout history had not lived this way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmmv8chaz28d2d3wxt495mm))
- As *Homo sapiens*, we evolved in an environment and social context aligned with our instincts to be outside, procreate, find food, and celebrate with our small clan. For the vast majority of our 300,000 years as nomadic hunter-gatherers, we relied only on simple, hand-made technology. We satisfied all needs directly from nature and face-to-face communities of fewer than 150 people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmmvmjcvtett0paf3vd5sec))
- This means that most of us today are experiencing a profound [discrepancy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7584376/) between how we evolved to live and how we now live. The unchanging material realities undergirding human life are food, clothing, shelter and fire – yet today most of us do not participate in directly providing these for ourselves or our families. In developed economies, less than 10 per cent of the labour force is [involved](https://ourworldindata.org/employment-in-agriculture) with food production, and in the US and western Europe it is less than 5 per cent. The number of hunters is [decreasing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10344-020-01410-0) every year across industrialised countries, with 5 per cent in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States, and only 1 per cent of Europeans currently pursuing game. It’s exceedingly rare for anyone to build their own shelter and, in the era of fast fashion, only the privileged few can afford to make their own clothing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmmw2s87ap759d3r7n5hqcw))
- In Western countries, most of us have also lost the benefits of a multigenerational, supportive clan because we live in isolated homes, paying for much of the care we used to get for free from our reciprocal relationships. We can hire others to provide childcare, education, medical treatment, therapy, entertainment, and spiritual ceremony. Those without resources often don’t get these essential human needs met. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmmw6pav1e5128jgr91zf3d))
- We used to achieve community healing through storytelling, dancing and ritual, rather than self-medicating stress with all kinds of addictions, endless shopping and digital entertainment. Unlike the hunter-gatherer, whose daily activities are crucial to survival and to supporting the community, many of us work at what the anthropologist David Graeber termed ‘[bullshit jobs](https://psyche.co/ideas/why-do-so-many-people-think-they-are-in-a-bullshit-job)’. These positions don’t contribute any measurable human benefit besides increasing GDP. Contrary to the self-sufficiency of a wild forager, many of us have very little autonomy over our life decisions, and navigate a labyrinth of laws, rules and regulations for every choice we make in a centralised, global economy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmmwnr5zawssgg2pw86qe5p))
- Yet the wild way of life is still ingrained in all of us because we share the same genetic blueprint (save for some small immune and diet-related adaptations) of existing hunter-gatherer societies and our ancient ancestors. Our brains and bodies are still built to live a Palaeolithic lifestyle: outside, exposed to the elements, getting plenty of exercise, and finding everything we need in nature. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmmwzfb3tv7ryf716brwkb7))
- Perhaps the discrepancy between modern life and our evolutionary past explains why so many people today suffer from a wide range of ailments that hunter-gatherers generally don’t experience, from [myopia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0271531714002863) and [metabolic](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30511505/) disease to mental illness and auto-immune disorders. ‘Knowing how genetic and cultural evolution over millennia shaped us helps explain today’s human predicament, how hard that predicament is to deal with, and underlines how abnormal human life is in the 21st century,’ [wrote](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9343229/) the biologists Paul Ehrlich and Anne Ehrlich of Stanford University in the journal *Bioscience* in 2022. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmmxcbcx54anyy2jq6rp2c6))
- Certainly, life is difficult for the wild forager – resources can be scarce, infections and parasites are commonplace, and enforced social taboos can make life occasionally socially stressful. These communities don’t escape violence, homicides, and high rates of infant mortality. Today, many of us living in developed economies experience a variety of improvements in quality of life, with easy access to food, water, climate-controlled shelter, advanced health care and, perhaps, way too much entertainment. Yet we can still be denied sufficient leisure time, supportive intergenerational social networks, and a life-long sense of purpose and relationship with nature. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmmxpm0karnep739y4ky646))
- So, what can you do to tap into your evolved human nature, short of moving back into a primordial cave? How can you be more wild while participating in modern life? It took me several years of experimentation and research, yet by learning about our hunter-gatherer origins and spending time with folks living close to nature, I found ways to minimise evolutionary mismatch and regain my health and happiness. The following steps provide proven strategies for better aligning your habits with your wild instincts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmmy43ry1072t3c4z045xgb))
- Integrating some ancestral practices into your daily life is called rewilding, and it can be done by anyone, anywhere. It involves recovering skills and benefits that modern industrialisation has taken away and can improve your quality of life, health metrics and personal satisfaction. At the deepest level, it is about becoming humans in direct relationship with nature once again, restoring our heritage as wild people who do not exploit each other or Earth’s resources. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmmy95tqw31b8rqgy1kzrev))
- In industrialised nations, more than 90 per cent of our time is spent [inside](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=9100LMBU.TXT) buildings and vehicles, many of them constructed with synthetic products. This statistic has entirely flipped during 300,000 years of *Homo sapiens*’ history – we once spent *at least* 90 per cent of our time outside. The modern indoor lifestyle has [adverse effects](https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(21)00811-3/fulltext) on our physiology, mood, circadian rhythms, and even our microbiome, because industrial building materials do not provide [exposure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674921008113) to the bacteria we co-evolved with. (A healthy, diverse microbiome is important for maintaining a healthy immune system and metabolism.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmmyp07ep0cfzs86vdy1tvp))
- It is easy to address this problem because any routine activity can be deliberately moved outside. Choose to sit on the café patio while getting coffee with a friend. Take phone calls while on a neighbourhood walk. If you work with a laptop, you can bring it anywhere. I’ve been known to work from a low-hanging tree branch! A park bench or picnic table near a local pond can be an attractive place to get your daily dose of vitamin D, fresh air, microbes and bird song, and will give you a live landscape to train your eyes on during breaks (this helps prevent myopia or worsening myopia). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmmz2713t3tvy828s2w3sr8))
- Wild foragers engage in low- to moderate-level activity that is integrated into daily tasks. There is no separation between work, exercise, socialisation and recreation – it’s all just daily life. In contrast, the average college-educated employee spends most of their time sitting; the movement necessary for providing their basic needs has been outsourced to other labourers who farm, harvest, manufacture, transport, deliver and stock the goods they order from phones. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmmzx34kvhm9s0cnqvm6d52))
- Modern humans have invested so much creativity and inventiveness in trying to reduce movement – from the coffee machine that begins the day to the remote control that concludes our nights – that we are deprived of opportunities to leave the couch, bed, car or desk. Exercise becomes an optional activity that [one in four](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity) people just don’t do enough. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn070vm8r8n34zd3w5arq1))
- To address this, deliberately add more movement into daily life by choosing to do some of the work of modern machines throughout your day. Unplug the food processor and mix up pancakes by hand. Put the Roomba away and sweep the floor with a broom. Always take the stairs, and park your car far away from your destination so that you have to walk a little bit for every journey. Leave the gym and take your exercising outside. Of course, you can also use your leisure time to get outside: go for a hike, explore a natural area, or learn orienteering. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn0h2why238dr896y36682))
- On a similar note, it is restorative to spend extended time in places that don’t feature human architecture, media and technology. These don’t have to be vast swaths of wilderness – even an undeveloped section of a riverbank, or a small patch of green can provide relief from stress in an environment of sunlight, fresh air, diverse microbes, aromatic compounds, and calming sights and sounds. Participants in a [study](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0051474) who spent four days in the wilderness without access to technology demonstrated improved cognitive skills and creativity. Numerous other [studies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12199-009-0086-9) have [demonstrated](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169204615000286?via%3Dihub) that time in natural settings improves mood, cortisol levels, blood pressure, pulse, immune response and overall happiness. So, spend free time regularly in the most wild natural settings you can find, especially if you live in an urban area, which tends to [increase](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10190) overall stress levels in residents. Research [suggests](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-44097-3) significant benefits can arise from spending just two hours per week in wild settings. I’m fortunate to live in the woods but, when I visit urban areas, I always make a point to go walking in nearby parks, or make stops at open spaces when travelling by car. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn14s70sjpsv124y2h7rcr))
- When you venture outside, it’s important to leave the bubble of comfort and convenience you are accustomed to in indoor environments and activities. Modern humans must accept that nature immersion will make them uncomfortable at some point. Maybe you’ll sit or climb on a rocky surface, deal with bug bites, prickly plants, the seasonal hazards of scorching sun, mud and rain, snow or ice, and exist in a general state of grime and sweat (which, incidentally, actually restores beneficial bacteria to your skin). Many of us have grown accustomed to eliminating all these outdoor discomforts with heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, cushioned floors and furniture, insect repellent, daily showers, sunglasses, thick down coats, and even heated blankets. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn1st23avy6j6w2z4m772b))
- By exposing yourself to nature’s discomforts, you strengthen your physiological systems, increase your resilience to persist through difficulty, and will feel more gratitude for the moments when you do experience comfort. Similarly, when you skip a meal, or exercise at high intensity, you provide a positive level of stress that allows your body to eliminate wastes and maintain fitness levels more efficiently. These discomforts and short-lived stresses are similar to what hunter-gatherers experience, and are what shaped our species during our long evolutionary period. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn21zr6ynxx56c3d59ywbs))
- If you are in good health, to reap the benefits of positive stress, also known as hormesis, you can try fasting intermittently, taking 15-18 hours between dinner and lunch the next day. Deliberately pushing your exertion for 20- to 30-second intervals several times during exercise [trains](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(17)30099-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413117300992%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) your mitochondria – the powerhouses of your cells – to deal with stress efficiently, increase energy production, and reduce cellular ageing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn281mmrev2agve187gqsh))
- Other forms of hormesis [include](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7520385/) increased heat and cold exposure practices such as cold showers, saunas, steam baths, swimming in natural water, and walking outside without a coat in freezing temperatures. Don’t overwhelm your body (certain cardiovascular and other illnesses preclude the safe practice of these activities – check with your physician if you are unsure), but try if you can to embrace the feeling of extreme temperature variation, not as something to be avoided, but as a natural force that strengthens and invigorates you for short periods of time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn2wbdwx4vzmagwgk7059c))
- Both heat and cold exposure can [improve](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00115.2017) your cardiovascular fitness and metabolism and there can be mood benefits as well. Build your tolerance by gradually increasing the time you spend in intense outdoor conditions, including exposure to sun (taking sensible precautions to avoid skin damage as needed in your part of the world), humidity, rain and snow. One way to introduce an easy hormetic practice is to end your showers with 15-30 seconds of cold water before turning off the tap. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn3axecwha0kbagrt1yage))
- All human cultures before modernisation walked barefoot or with minimal footwear, and they sat and reclined directly on the ground or on natural materials. Now, we rarely experience direct contact between the earth and our skin. We wear cushioned, structured shoes that deprive us of the sensations of walking and running, [weaken](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5829167/) our feet, and compress our toes. Always clothed, we deprive our bodies of healthy exposure to the elements, and we’ve dulled the capacity of our largest sensory organ – the skin. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn3v6v9tqzdxt9x40558xp))
- Of course, we need some covering for protection and warmth, but addressing such extreme disconnection from the natural environment will bring benefits. To start, going [barefoot](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19424280903386411) on bare ground for a few minutes every day will strengthen the musculature in your legs, feet and toes while reviving some of the sensory capacity of the soles of your feet. Choosing [minimal](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98070-0) footwear, with ample space for your toes, and without added cushioning or heel height, will also provide similar benefits. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn43nq8dvdndna1c4b4xqn))
- When you maintain friendships with a large group of loose contacts, your interactions are less satisfying because you cannot share the wide range of human emotions with so many. With fewer people, you can develop stronger emotional ties, which leads to greater feelings of support and emotional resilience. Culling my outings with friends to the people I truly trust and respect helped me shape my social life towards a more ‘tribal’ organisation of five to seven very close contacts. This strategy works even for online interactions. When I reduced my number of Facebook friends to around 100, this social network suddenly became a much more intimate venue where I felt that I could truly express myself and fully engage with others.

- **The cost of evolutionary mismatch.** Most of us today are experiencing a profound discrepancy between how we evolved to live and how we now live, with harmful consequences for our physical and mental health. Fortunately, there are several straightforward ways to address this mismatch. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn60ggnhzavh1x6wb616fp))
- **Spend more time outside.** Too much time inside has many adverse effects on human physiology, so look for ways to get outside – from coffee on the patio to working by a pond. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn62vrzjy6qesh82cx712m))
- **Integrate more movement into your day.** As well as spending most of their time outside, ancestral humans were also far more active than most people today. Look for opportunities to get moving, from cooking by hand to taking the stairs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn644jdgzswaqctz0r1y2e))
- **Spend extended time in wild settings.** Beyond spending more time outside, look for opportunities to be in nature. It doesn’t have to be a wilderness – even a small patch of green can reduce your stress levels. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn65km9729q1dv6gz6z829))
- **Positively stress your body with some discomfort.** Positive stress is known as hormesis and it brings many physical and mental benefits. Ways to experience it include fasting and cold-water immersion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn66z6gdqwy1fyzc83qmm9))
- **Go barefoot.** Opting for minimal footwear when possible will improve the musculature of your legs and feet and reinvigorate your skin. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn6a21fgb4ehd8mvgh9ds8))
- **Aim for autonomy in small social groups.** We evolved to interact in small, trusted groups. Prioritise socialising with people whom you truly trust and respect, and deliberately reduce the size of your online social networks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn6bjj0yvhk4ma17pp7k95))
- **Eat wild foods, learn to forage them yourself.** Learning to source some wild foods from your local environment is a fun and beneficial way to spend time in nature. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn6fhqb6wdecn3wv0zk86h))
- Rewilding doesn’t mean we must all try to recreate a purist, Palaeolithic lifestyle. This is impossible and impractical. Instead, think of rewilding as a path of deepening awareness of how we humans can satisfy our needs from nature. It requires new skills and may take generations to carry out. When we learn the survival methods of our ancient ancestors – such as [friction-fire making](https://aeon.co/videos/the-amazing-man-who-produces-iron-using-only-wood-bark-fibre-and-clay), foraging, [hunting](https://aeon.co/videos/trapped-boiled-devoured-how-to-eat-well-in-the-wild), animal processing, hide-tanning, flint-knapping, basket-weaving, [shelter building](https://aeon.co/videos/make-shelter-how-to-build-an-awesome-hut-only-with-naturally-occurring-materials) or leather working – we decrease our dependence on industrial goods and gain self-sufficiency that we have been deprived of during the past two centuries of technological development. When we teach these skills to younger generations, we ensure that they are not lost to humanity. If our centralised industrial systems fail to provide basic needs at any point in the future, those people who have mastered ancestral survival skills will fare better. In the parlance of the COVID-19 pandemic, you can become your own ‘essential worker’ in a time of crisis. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpmn6vjj9rgj9mc5sbf7r9tb))
- Yet practising these skills is also fun and brings immediate benefits. Working with your hands is strengthening; hunting and foraging provide sustenance and a dopamine reward; and providing for your needs from the outdoors boosts self-esteem, resilience and mindfulness.
