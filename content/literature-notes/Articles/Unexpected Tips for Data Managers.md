## Highlights
- Do musicians expect to be promoted to conductors? The question makes little sense: promotion implies ranking. In this case, there is none, musicians and conductors have different responsibilities. Harmony arises when these elements combine into a consistent and pleasing whole. A Data team behaves like an orchestra. Its performance comes from the interactions between the conductor (Manager) and the musicians (ICs). They are different jobs, so there‚Äôs no promotion between them.

- ‚ÄúA common misconception is that Managers and decision-makers are the same. The reality is richer. Teams make a lot of decisions. Some belong to the Manager. For instance, deciding a promotion or a pay rise. Most decisions are ICs‚Äô: from technical design to project delivery through project management.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jg17wjc53f1sydch6ncd3))

  Most decisions in a team are IC decisions. Both them and Manager‚Äôs decisions trigger Team actions. Which should lead to further need to make decisions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jg8z7fdy6h3m98h39xbbm))
- To ensure a well-functioning Data team, it‚Äôs crucial to recognize the distinct responsibilities of Managers and ICs. This clear division of responsibilities prevents overlap, which generates confusion. It allows each role to focus on its core functions, improving delivery. In BlaBlaCar‚Äôs Data teams, we‚Äôve implemented the following distinctions: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jgn93sst89n2tcecytxee))
- ‚Ä¢ **Managers create value by focusing on connections.** Inside the team, that‚Äôs people management; it connects people together, from projects to processes. These include decisions on staffing, performance management, career development, team dynamics. Outside the team, Managers nurture connections with the broader company ecosystem. They share information, represent their teams, or handle roadmap dependencies.
  ‚Ä¢ **ICs create value when leveraging expertise to implement high-quality solutions.** This requires decisions on designing and implementing data solutions, conducting analysis, and clarifying stakeholders‚Äô needs. ICs are like musicians: they perform technically demanding art. They decide how to play their part, in collaboration with the rest of the orchestra.

  Managers create value by nurturing the connections between teams. Abundant context leads to higher performing teams. They have more information, which enables them to make better decisions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jh4w3zwb2g9etr640b09s))

  Inside the team, Managers focus on connecting people together. They also create new connections ‚Äî through processes for instance ‚Äî to make ICs successful. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jhe0q049wbesawxrpw746))
- Making bad decisions leads to failure; so, try to avoid them. ICs typically possess the deepest technical expertise and hands-on experience. That makes them well-equipped to make informed decisions on the technical aspects of their work. For example, ask the Data Scientists and Engineers what their recommended AI architecture is vs. buying it off the shelf and telling them to ‚Äújust use it‚Äù. Don‚Äôt ask managers to build your stack. Instead, have them set constraints for solutions. Then, give ICs the autonomy to pick solutions based on their context, their expertise and these constraints. That limits bad decisions, and saves time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jhzbqkmgest54fzbda04v))
- In BlaBlaCar‚Äôs Data teams, we implemented this through our ‚ÄúData Stack Governance‚Äù and ‚ÄúChapters‚Äù forums. We copied existing, well-functioning forums from the broader Engineering department, which Data teams are part of. There are the ‚ÄúBlaBlaCar Architecture Team‚Äù ‚Äî codenamed ‚ÄúBAT‚Äù ü¶á ‚Äî to review architecture decisions, the Backend Guild, the soon-to-be Software Factory Guild, ‚Ä¶ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jjgjmqdsttz2n4z46h6ex))
- Shifting decision-making to ICs empowers them. That‚Äôs because in an organization, decision-making gives power. Empowerment fosters a culture of ownership and accountability. By empowering ICs to make decisions, organizations reduce bottlenecks, speed up delivery, and improve the quality of their data products. Shifting technical decision-making responsibilities to ICs also helps to develop their leadership and problem-solving skills. This prepares them for senior roles. By trusting ICs to make these decisions, organizations foster a culture of innovation and continuous improvement. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jjytzq64z5bw1aqyp7v01))
- **Internal mobility allows ICs to experiment with different roles and projects**. They capitalize on their tenure, while discovering new topics. Moving to a new team helps share knowledge; it gives Managers more staffing flexibility, including for promotions. By providing these opportunities, organizations kickstart a virtuous circle: reduced turnover means a well-rounded workforce, which is more impactful, creating new opportunities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jk8w9tc2v40nh9qcmdp25))
- **Chapter projects empower ICs with project ownership and leadership responsibilities within their skillset**. A Chapter is the forum for people using the same technology. In BlaBlaCar‚Äôs Data teams, we have four Chapters: Data Engineering, Data Analytics, Data Science, and Data Back-End. It‚Äôs a great avenue to improve technically and deliver impact transversally. This enables organizations to create new opportunities for ICs, like the Chapter Lead role. The Chapter Leads guide and mentor other ICs in their area of expertise, define standards, identify talent, and represent the Chapter‚Äôs interests. By establishing these positions, organizations foster a sense of community, provide valuable mentorship, and increase job satisfaction and team performance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jkkr8ccp20sp0aj4mp03y))
- **Career Ladder gives ICs perspective on future responsibilities**. It sets expectations for how to grow. In the Data teams, we saw a significant change in behavior when we started promoting ICs to Senior roles. This created concrete role models to look up to. An added benefit of building a career ladder: it makes Managers‚Äô assessments more objective. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jmbxx5g4rc0bhmjw3zwk9))

  ICs can grow through acquiring experience in their team, through Chapter projects, and sometimes by switching to another team. This accumulated experience move them up in the career ladder. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jmt8venj6w410d4btb8dy))
- *Beware: ICs don‚Äôt buy promises.* They want real opportunities; organizations must walk the talk. Measure how many internal mobility moves your organization delivers. Report on the time dedicated to Chapter topics. List which decisions ICs are making vs. Managers. These are yardsticks measuring the impact of your growth strategy for ICs. The last and most important point: compensation must support this strategy. This means that some ICs will earn more than their Managers. It happens in our Data teams. Failing to align compensation and opportunities dooms the effort! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jv99qpw00b3d3xfnc9rcj))
- Managers make mistakes and these mistakes are costly. That‚Äôs because they impact people, and are typically not reversible. Training helps avoid these errors. Deciding when to start management training is difficult: too early, it‚Äôs very theoretical; too late, and mistakes pile up. My recommendation is to train Managers after 6 months. At BlaBlaCar, all managers take the same training program. Beyond this initial training, I support organizing recurring sessions for continuous improvement. Within BlaBlaCar‚Äôs Data teams, we set up a 1h co-development session every 6 weeks. In this session, 5‚Äì6 people collaboratively solve one participant‚Äôs problem. We found this [framework](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1jOR3gICPnnDjNmnqO5er4ejIYf7rsk4VCr5hBURHtuc/edit) very efficient, both in terms of continuous improvement and team building. Data Managers are also part of the broader ‚ÄúEngineering Management Monthly Meeting‚Äù. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jvr6pecvk7bbpmvqqnmzn))
- Training is indispensable for new managers. It‚Äôs valuable for tenured managers as well, contributing to building a consistent management culture throughout the company. Management training has a side benefit: clarifying managerial skill sets. This proves useful for ICs‚Äô career development, clarifying the key factors of success in the managerial track. This knowledge equips them to make more informed decisions when considering a move into management. Below are three managerial skills that are often overlooked:
  1. *Exemplarity, composure under pressure*. Managers keep their team‚Äôs and company‚Äôs interest in mind, even through challenging times.
  2. *Self-awareness and versatility in interactions*. Managers cultivate self-awareness to compartmentalize form from content. They should master active listening and various communication channels.
  3. *Courage*. Managers must have the courage to make tough decisions, and to carry them out. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jwk4jffkqz1bked2xavrf))
- Management is more than a job title. You need to learn how to do that well. You are not born a manager, you painstakingly become one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jxc1wf5d5tjhjbe8k4n8r))
- When scaling a team, managers must anticipate decisions they‚Äôll make in two or three years. This perspective ensures that staffing includes future needs and growth, not only immediate ones. Staffing decisions are similar to buying a house: you don‚Äôt decide to buy a house looking 6-month ahead. If a 6-month time horizon is the maximum you can get, consider renting‚Ä¶ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jy1qk6k6jm78mxfp9vt12))
- One exercise I run systematically when we open a position in the Data team is to project our seniority distribution in 2 years. That identifies where we‚Äôll have bottlenecks or competition for promotions I then walk backwards to today. This exercise ensures I manage growth opportunities for ICs. It frontloads difficult conversations, which I find useful; we can anticipate them. An example is when we backfill Senior roles with Junior ones. We bet on other Confirmed profiles growing into Senior roles within a 2‚Äì3 year horizon. That bet triggers ownership, mentorship, and deliver discussions. That‚Äôs also when we kickstart internal mobility moves. By taking a proactive approach in anticipating future challenges, organizations protect themselves against known unknowns.

- ‚ÄúYou make wildly different staffing decisions depending on the team‚Äôs context. A 6-month vs. 2-year staffing perspective yields specific dynamics and teams.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jyzqynkcp63k1yqr82khf))
- Why do ICs declare they want a managerial position? Too often, that‚Äôs the only way they think they can grow. When you break that mental barrier, you see ICs staying on their track longer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz5jzpmatvsdnmqx8dydnb73))
