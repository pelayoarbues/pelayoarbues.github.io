## Highlights
- Gendo can take 2D drawings, sketches or text prompts and turn them into intricate, realistic visualisations. Each prompt generates a range of options for users to choose from and, unlike mainstream generative image platforms, the visualisations generated on the platform can be edited. Sections can be masked and tweaked, as well as specific details such as colours, lighting, or structural features added or taken away. 
  It is transforming how architects and designers visualise projects. Through a unique combination of generative AI models and machine learning techniques, the proprietary platform can turn designs into stunning visualisations in seconds, as well as add and edit details from scratch based on text prompts.

- Already, Gendo is used in beta by a range of global architecture practices, including Zaha Hadid Architects, KPF, David Chipperfield Architects, and Benoy.
  George Proud, CEO & co-founder at Gendo said: “Mainstream generative image platforms can be really impressive, but they simply aren’t fit for purpose when it comes to a sector like architecture and design. In our industry, detail and precision is everything. Gendo has been designed specifically for these professionals; we’ve built an AI platform that speeds up design work and allows creativity to flourish.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j28v703bhd4wv7rn3anq17yk))
