- Data manipulation and analysis can be challenging and involve working with large datasets. Thankfully, a widely used Python library known as Pandas has become the go-to tool for processing and manipulating data. Pandas recently got an update, which is version 2.0. This article takes a closer look at what Pandas is, its success, and what the new version brings, including its ecosystem around Arrow, Polars, and DuckDB.
