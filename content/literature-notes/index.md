I love learning. 

This is a door to what I am currently learning. Lately I have been using [Reader by Readwise](https://readwise.io/read) quite a lot. It allows me to read, highlight and take notes of almost anything.  It has a great integration with Obsidian that blends seamlessly with my workflow.
