- Mal McCallio, founder of primelocation.com, then worked propert, and then helped setting up zoopla.  
- Portals are in a phase of experimentation in 4
	- Copiloting
	- Discovering, using AI to help users to find listing
	- List enhancements, floor plans. Currenlty lots of info is missing, AI may help filling the gaps from text or images. Write better content. Virtual Home Staging on the fly.
	- Internal processes
- JITI, speak to it and get to an answer about the kind of property the consumer is looking for, attention spans are low, consumers want to save time on looking through all the properties. Before, those were the filters you got and that is it.
- AI changing the search experience, from search to discovery and recommender. Interesting challenge for advertising model, because it is how portal monetize. 
- If portals were about show what the consumer is interested in, they would not make as much money.
