I'm a little brother, so I learned to lose as soon as I learned to crawl. I played in a youth futsal team and there was one year when we lost ALL our games. This over-exposure to defeat made me realise that I don't need to win to be happy, but I do need a context that allows me to chase victory. 

> Don't take yourself too seriously. 

I have never taken myself too seriously. This way of thinking has made me very aware of my failures. I used to be aware of them and I didn't hide them, but I didn't broadcast them either. Now I'm at a stage where I think I have to be proud of those failures. Maybe it's because I've started listening to punk again, maybe it's because I reject the false perfection that's on display on social networks. Punk is, after all, a cultural response to the social context, so maybe the two are very much linked.

I wrote this post a while ago, but I recently discovered the concept of the [failure resume](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/a-failure-resume/), so I've changed the title from My biggest fuck-ups to My Failure Resume, and I'm going to start with my most resounding failures both as a data scientist and in my most recent management position. Here they are:

Top DS Failures:
- Inability to reproduce the code and get the same results in a research paper as part of my thesis. I learnt the importance of using version control, saving intermediate results and managing development environment dependencies well.
- Negative valuations in a production property valuation model. Yes, I could do that! That was a big relief for the people in my team. I learned the importance of model monitoring, how to analyse model behaviour when inputs take extreme values, and how to be wary of tree models.
- Putting the engineering team in a sweat. I had to cluster users' geolocations and thought DBScan was a good fit. I did not think about the production release and availability of the library in Spark. As a consultant, I was asked to solve a problem and didn't ask about the technical context, volumetrics or anything else.
- Business intrusion. In more than one project, I didn't know how to deal with business constraints. We delivered data of dubious quality, which reduced our credibility, and also created a huge technical debt because we were not allowed to version the reports, so you had to carry one of them around with you historically.


Top management failures:
- Giving too much responsibility without enough support. Asking junior people in certain roles to take on responsibility without giving them enough support. Setting them up for failure almost by design.
- Not making sure they got the message. One of the most important things you can do as a manager is to give feedback. On a number of occasions I have sinned by not making sure that the message I was sending was fully understood.
- I make jokes when I shouldn't. Sometimes I've been a loudmouth and made team jokes that didn't go down well with certain people.

This is my CV of mistakes so far, I'm sure I'll soon be able to add more `medals` to wear on my lapel.
