Every aspiring Data Scientist should get started by getting a solid background in Statistics. There are two books that can work as great 101 materials:

- Introduction to Probability by Joe Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang. It is now available at [http://probabilitybook.net](http://probabilitybook.net/), with [videos](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/youtube) and other [resources](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110).
- [Probability and Statistics by Morris H. DeGroot and Mark J. Schervish](http://bio5495.wustl.edu/Probability/Readings/DeGroot4thEdition.pdf). It is called the Bible by some stats teachers.
