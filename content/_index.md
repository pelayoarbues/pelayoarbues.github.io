Hi there!

I am Pelayo Arbués. I am Head of Data Science at idealista. Previously, I worked as an Applied Economics researcher on various projects at the University of Oviedo. During three of those years, my main focus was to write a Ph.D. in Transport Economics, Spatial Econometrics, and Regional Science. In 2015 I left Academia to pursue a career in Data Science. Initially, I worked for a small startup in the Telecommunications sector and then moved to a consultancy firm where I successfully developed a Recommender System for a large retail company. Currently, I lead the Data Science initiative for idealista, the leading real estate portal in Southern Europe.
