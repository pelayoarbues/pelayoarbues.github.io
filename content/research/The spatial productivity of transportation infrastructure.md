# Abstract

Transportation infrastructure services may cause an impact on the economy of the region in which they are located and, additionally, they are likely to have an impact on other regions. This effect has been labeled the spillover effect. In this study, the existence of direct and spillover effects of road, railway, airport and seaport infrastructure projects is tested by estimating a production function. Together with this primary objective, two common concerns in the literature are addressed: the lack of theoretical foundations for spatial econometrics models and the likely endogenous relationship between transport infrastructure and economic development. The estimated production function takes the form of a Spatial Durbin Model and is estimated using panel data from the 47 peninsular Spanish provinces by alternatively applying a Maximum Likelihood estimator and Instrumental Variables/Generalized Method of Moments estimators. According to the estimates, road transport infrastructure positively affects the output of the region in which the infrastructure is located and its neighboring provinces, while the remaining modes of transportation projects cause no significant impacts on average.
