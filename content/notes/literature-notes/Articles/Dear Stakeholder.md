## Highlights
- **When you ask us for help, tell us what you’re trying to achieve.** Don’t just say “I need this piece of data”… tell us that you’re trying to achieve this higher level goal that you believe will be enhanced or achieved by X outcome, where you could use data to make a more optimal decision or enrich your product.

- **Data infra work can, should and often does have a long-term positive ROI in being a multiplier on future capacity or capability.** It also increases work satisfaction in the data team - in my experience, data folks are neat creatures… they want their repos and workspaces to be as clean as possible. Ignoring data infra work for the long-term is perilous, as it results in lower efficiency, lower satisfaction in the data team… a recipe for turnover and failure.
