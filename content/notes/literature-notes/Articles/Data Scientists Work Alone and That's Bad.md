- Document Note: This essay discusses the importance of code review in software engineering and the challenges of data science, where the norm is for data scientists to work alone. The author highlights the benefits of code review and collaboration, such as receiving feedback and learning more quickly, and explains the risks of data scientists working alone, such as the difficulty of collaborating and maintenance becoming a massive burden. The author also proposes solutions to make data science more collaborative, such as sharing Jupyter notebooks or setting up regular pair programming sessions.

## Highlights
- many data scientists like myself who start with scientific programming and then find their way into software engineering are particularly dangerous. We have the ability to pretty much program whatever we want. This makes us prolific which is a terrible trait to combine with sloppy code.

- The norm is that of a lonely life for the data scientist. Whether they lie near analytics, machine learning, or elsewhere in the large latent space that spans this ill-defined role, just like in the curse of high-dimensionality, they are likely alone.

- Analyses, models, one-off-scripts: all of these endeavors are usually built solo. Itâ€™s just hard to collaborate on training a machine learning model. And so, we often work alone. Each project is a [one-bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) project. Beyond the inherent business risks that this represents, this kinda sucks for learning and development.
