## Highlights
- Backlogs *never* shrink. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5he241dvcqw5sga298pz06))
- Important tasks never go into the backlog. We create them, we work on them, and we ship them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5heh4bz19ppj7ew9ec93cz))
- The truth is, we always know what task is most important, and we work on it until it’s done. Everything else is fluff. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5hf3tzdhqzbqpw1x133e13))
- Backlogs exist because they’re a great way to avoid difficult conversations and shift blame away from product to engineering. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5hg2qb6mkf2x8ysrzk7ssh))
- it’s much easier to say “you’ll add it to the backlog,” than to spend an hour explaining why the suggestion is irrelevant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5hn4a23341f8b14sq8qv49))
- product manager’s job is *not* to create as many tickets as possible but to *delete* as many as they can and avoid unnecessary work at all costs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5hp5rhxm7tw1ms7k4231qs))
- a product manager creating more tasks than its engineers can deliver is also producing waste. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5hqmd5ha46ye9wn2sjzt7v))
- The only way to make a backlog even more harmful is to require engineers to “refine” the tasks there. That way, you’ll be wasting time from product managers *and* engineers, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5hr7zdng61j6sfeby8jn9s))
- Do not maintain a backlog unless it’s the backlog for your next few weeks of work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5kms7fynmw46929fkpyde4))
- If you’d need more than two or three weeks to get rid of everything on your backlog, you’re planning too far ahead, at the wrong level of abstraction. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5kn1j5n1yswqjzfjrtz21n))
- Everything further away than two or three works of work should go into a high-level roadmap. You should revisit that roadmap regularly, and product managers should share it with engineers and explain why each item is important ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5kne440rn1hv4q8bf2cp2q))
- If a bug’s been in the backlog for more than three months, it’s already a feature. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5kp25ahxxmntavqdbqw615))
