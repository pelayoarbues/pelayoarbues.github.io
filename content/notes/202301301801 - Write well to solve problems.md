According to [Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1460660779309572105?s=20&t=7dRAEzZ4YbsG8TvkblNYoA), in order to write well, one must read well. Similarly, to think well, particularly when dealing with ill-defined problems, one must write.

I've been consistently writing for some time now. I take notes on the books I read and then process them by applying lessons I've learned from various sources, particularly from "How to Take Smart Notes". From the connections between these ideas, I generate new texts.

I also write meeting minutes to keep a record of the decisions made and the actions to be taken for those who weren't present at the meeting, and to identify the [Directly Responsible Individual](https://medium.com/@mmamet/directly-responsible-individuals-f5009f465da4) who is responsible for carrying out those tasks.

Additionally, I write process documentation to standardize our team's expectations on a project.

Furthermore, I write about problems that I encounter and for which I have yet to find a solution. When attempting to tackle these problems, I write my thought process down.

I intend to make more of these writings public. While newsletters are currently trending, I prefer to create a digital garden for now. Anyone who wishes to do so can subscribe to the RSS feed, observe my learning process in real-time, and participate in discussions.
