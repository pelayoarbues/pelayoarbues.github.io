I'm a little brother so I learned to lose as soon as I learned to crawl. I played in a youth futsal team and there was one year when we lost ALL our games. The next year we came second. This overexposure to defeat has made it very clear to me that to be happy I don't need to win, but I need a context that allows me to be able to chase a win. 

> Don't take yourself too seriously. 

I have never taken myself seriously. This way of thinking has led me to be very aware of my failures. I used to be aware of them and I didn't hide them, but I didn't air them either. Now I'm in a period where I think I also have to be proud of those failures. Maybe it's because I've started listening to punk again, maybe it's because I reject the false perfection that's exposed on social networks. Punk is ultimately a cultural response to the social context, so maybe the two issues are very much linked.

I wrote this post a while ago, but I recently discovered the concept of [failure resume](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/a-failure-resume/), so I've changed the title from My biggest fuck-ups to My Failure resume and I'm launching into my most resounding failures both as a Data Scientist and in my most recent managerial position. Here they go:

Top DS screw-ups:
	- Inability to reproduce the code and get the same results in a research paper as part of my thesis. I learned the importance of using version control, saving intermediate results and managing development environment dependencies well.
	- Negative valuations in a production real estate valuation model. Yes, I was able to do that! Which is a major release of fear from the people in my team. I learned about the importance of model monitoring, how to analyse model behaviour when inputs take extreme values and to be wary of tree models.
	- Making the engineering team sweat sanger. DBScan, development of a clustering algorithm without thinking about the production release and availability of the library in Spark. As a consultant I was asked to solve a problem and I didn't ask any more about the technical context, nor volumetrics, nor anything else.
	- Business intrusions. In more than one project I didn't know how to manage business pressures. We delivered data with a dubious quality that reduced our credibility and also generated a huge technical debt because they did not allow us to version the reports, so you had to carry one of these with you historically.

Top managerial screw-ups:
- Giving too much responsibility without enough support. Asking junior colleagues in certain functions to take responsibility without giving them sufficient support. This set them up for failure almost by design.
- Not making sure they got the message. One of the most important jobs as a manager is to give feedback. On a couple of occasions I have sinned by not making sure that the message I was sending was being fully understood.
- I make jokes when I shouldn't. Sometimes I've been a big mouth and followed up on team jokes that didn't sit well with certain people.

This is my CV of mess-ups so far, I'm sure I'll soon be able to add more "medals" to wear on my lapel.
