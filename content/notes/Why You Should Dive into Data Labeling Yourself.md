Recently, I've been immersing myself in projects that necessitate data labeling, a task often seen as mundane. However, I willingly take on this task for several reasons.

Firstly, my schedule is often packed with back-to-back meetings, leaving me with short 15 to 30-minute breaks in between. Instead of idling away this time, I use it to decompress and clear my [headspace](notes/Headspace%20for%20managers.md). This could involve taking notes from the previous meeting or preparing for the next one. But more often than not, I find solace in tasks that don't require intense mental effort - such as tagging data. 

I also value my team's time immensely. Their focus should remain undeterred on problem-solving. If I can eliminate any hindrances or blockages by taking up tasks like these, I consider it time well spent.

However, the primary reason that drives me towards hand-labeling data is the wealth of knowledge you can gain from it. It gives you an estimate of how challenging a problem might be for a human to solve. Having spearheaded numerous Data Science projects, I've developed an instinctive understanding of how human difficulty translates into challenges for an automated system.

Labeling also helps identify those pesky corner cases - the outliers that can make or break your project's success. While analyzing a project and estimating its potential risks and complexities, it's easy to overlook these corner cases and focus on the average inference call instead. But remember - devil lies in the details! By annotating data yourself, you gain a vivid understanding of how vague these corner cases can be if they overlap between different classes and what types of corner cases you might encounter in real-world scenarios (production). 

Now let's address another aspect: convincing your team about the importance of data labeling. They may agree or disagree with you, but when they see you diving headfirst into the task, they're more likely to follow suit. The question then arises - how many instances should you label yourself before delegating the task to a labeling team? There's no one-size-fits-all answer as it largely depends on the problem at hand. My rule of thumb is to label until you start feeling monotonous. For instance, in one of our recent projects involving a text classifier, I tagged over 10k instances but found that I stopped gaining new insights after about 7k text bodies.

So, the next time you or your Data Science team embarks on a new project, don't shy away from getting your hands dirty with data labeling.
