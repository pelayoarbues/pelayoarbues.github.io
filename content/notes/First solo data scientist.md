I've walked in those shoes - the solitary data scientist at a startup. Despite my six years of experience as an applied econometrician, I came to realize that I was essentially a novice data scientist. I had significant skill gaps in areas such as technology, computation, data engineering, software development, and everything beyond statistics and econometrics. This included the much-needed soft skills.

If you're a junior data scientist about to embark on your first solo gig at a company, prepare yourself for the journey ahead. The company is likely trying to navigate the unexplored territory of data potential without a solid business case for this venture. If this initiative was truly central to their value proposition, they would likely have brought on board a more experienced professional. Regardless, you'll probably be responsible for running Proof of Concepts, addressing data quality issues, conducting product analysis and managing anything else related to data - including some outlandish ideas.

However, it's not all doom and gloom - working on real-life projects provides an invaluable opportunity to test your skills under pressure. You'll learn so much! But remember that you won't have any references or even a co-pilot who might spot glaring errors in your work. You'll be learning on the job through trial and error - which can sometimes be tough to swallow. In my case, I was lucky enough to work alongside fantastic software developers and an amazing CTO; so I wasn't completely alone and gained significant insights about engineering and technology. But boy did I make some big mistakes.

The main challenge is that you'll also bear all advanced analytics decisions, processes and workflows related to Data Science projects. This situation sets the stage for potential failure. Even for an experienced professional, balancing everyday projects while making strategic decisions is no easy feat. As a result, there's a high chance you might not meet the company's needs and expectations.

There will come a time when you grow tired of working solo and feel the need to move on. For me, that time arrived when I felt the need to learn from data engineers and other senior data scientists. I left my job at the startup and joined a 400 people consultancy firm, which was rapidly expanding its data science team. There, I found what I needed - a fast-paced atmosphere with top-notch data engineers, cloud architects, and a diverse group of data scientists.

So, my general advice is not to take on a job position as a junior person founding a Data Science department. If you're as daring as I was, good luck and feel free to reach out if I can assist you.
