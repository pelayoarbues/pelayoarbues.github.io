According to [Carol Dweck](literature-notes/Articles/Carol%20Dweck%20A%20Summary%20of%20Growth%20and%20Fixed%20Mindsets.md) the ability to learn is not fixed, it can change with your effort as intelligence, or any other quality, are treats that can be developed. Your basic qualities can be cultivated with attitude and work. In this setting failure does not define you, it is a sparkle or a starting point that might allow you to grow.
