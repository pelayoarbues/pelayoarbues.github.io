During my [PhD](notes/10%20Years%20Later.%20Lessons%20from%20My%20PhD%20Experience.md), I attended numerous conferences. Some were purely for learning purposes, but often, as part of my training, I was required to present my ongoing research. This experience significantly improved [my public speaking skills](mocs/moc-public-appearances.md) and helped me realize that presenting in front of others is an excellent way to meet new people.

Fast forward a few years to when I was living in Madrid. My university friend, [Alex Gonzalez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-gonzalez-diez-9a610930/), would often introduce me to the trending meetups. Back in 2015, we attended [Machine Learning Spain](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/machinelearningspain/) and R group [Grupo de Usuarios de R de Madrid](https://madrid.r-es.org/) along with Databeers. We particularly enjoyed [Databeers](https://www.tumblr.com/databeers); it had a great atmosphere and engaging talks. Through these events, we met many people - some of whom remain my friends today - and I've even had the opportunity to work with a few at different companies.

In both chapters of my life - as an academic researcher and a data professional - I discovered it's much easier to converse with diverse groups of people when you're the one giving the talk. It's logical; some attendees may be curious about your topic and want to learn more. Additionally, as a speaker, you're more visible; people already know your name and what you do, making it easy for them to approach you with questions.

Public speaking is an effective way to expand your network - not only with attendees but also with other meetup organizers. Many organizers struggle to find speakers who have unique insights or stories to share; hence, it's quite likely that you'll receive invitations asking for your collaboration. What's truly amazing is how some individuals remember you long after your talk has ended; on occasion, these connections have led me to new job opportunities.

So if it isn't obvious by now: **I wholeheartedly encourage everyone - especially young professionals - to embrace public speaking**. Not only does it enhance communication skills but it can also positively impact your personal life by introducing you to interesting individuals and creating new professional opportunities.
