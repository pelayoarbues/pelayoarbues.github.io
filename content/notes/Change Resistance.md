Change Resistance refers to the natural tendency of individuals, teams, and organizations to resist changes to the status quo. This resistance can stem from various sources, such as fear of the unknown, lack of understanding about the change, perceived loss of control, or concerns about increased workload or job loss. Change resistance can slow down or even halt the implementation of new ideas or processes, making it a significant barrier to innovation and progress.
