In the chemistry industry, [Verbund](Verbund.md) refers to an integrated production process where by-products from one process are used as inputs in another process, resulting in a more efficient and sustainable overall system.

In data science, a similar concept can be applied to the use of by-products from one analysis or modeling process as inputs for another analysis or modeling process, leading to a more efficient and effective overall data science workflow. For example, the features generated for a machine learning model can be used as input for another model, that is what feature stores are all about. 

This approach can help reduce data waste, increase efficiency, and improve overall data-driven decision-making. In this way you may create a network of intertwined processes. It also reminds me of the way stitch fix presented the [organic connection of its projects](https://cultivating-algos.stitchfix.com/).
