In [Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity](literature-notes/Books/Radical%20Candor%20Be%20a%20Kick-Ass%20Boss%20Without%20Losing%20Your%20Humanity.md), an Apple leader discusses the importance of balancing stability and growth within a team to ensure its proper functioning. To illustrate this, she categorizes team members based on their current career aspirations into rock stars and superstars.

> Rock stars are individuals who consistently deliver exceptional results but are on a gradual growth trajectory. They are like the Rock of Gibraltar in a team, providing stability and contentment with their current roles.

> Superstars, on the other hand, are those who are on a steeper growth trajectory and would go crazy if they were still doing the same job in a year's time.
