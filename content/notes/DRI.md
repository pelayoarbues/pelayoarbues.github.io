> DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) is the term used to indicate the person who holds ultimate responsibility for ensuring a project or task is completed.

The DRI concept aims to address issues related to ambiguity and [Deferred Responsability](notes/Deferred%20Responsability.md). In situations where a group of people are deciding what needs to be done, whether through a meeting or email exchange, the larger the group size, the more likely it is for individuals to dodge ownership. This issue can be resolved by designating a DRI.

The role of a DRI becomes particularly crucial in the context of cross-functional teams and when initiating new projects. As shared by former employees, DRIs played significant roles at Apple:

Each important piece of work had a single person charged with seeing to it that the work got done. 1/</p>&mdash; Ken Kocienda (@kocienda) <a href="https://twitter.com/kocienda/status/1563917075189358593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 28, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
