Bayesian-style belief updating involves changing probabilistic beliefs in response to evidence. [Bayes' rule]((https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule/?l=1zq)) is the theorem that indicates how much we should change our minds when we learn a new fact or observe new evidence.

Bayes' rule also tells us how strong a piece of evidence has to be in order to support a given hypothesis. [Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence](https://arbital.com/p/bayes_extraordinary_claims/). The theorem lets us see whether a piece of evidence is sufficient, or insufficient, to drive the probability of a hypothesis to over 50%. That is: an "[extraordinary claim](https://arbital.com/p/extraordinary_claims/)" is one with a low [prior probability](https://arbital.com/p/prior_probability/) in advance of considering the evidence, and "extraordinary evidence" is evidence with an extreme [likelihood ratio](https://arbital.com/p/relative_likelihood/) favoring the claim over its alternatives.

A corollary to extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence is "ordinary claims require only ordinary evidence".
