> Deferred Responsability (a.k.a. Diffusion of Responsability) is a sociophysiological phenomenon whereby a person is less likely to take responsibility for action or inaction when other bystanders or witnesses are present. The individual assumes that others either are responsible for taking action or have already done so.

The diffusion of responsibility refers to the decreased responsibility of action each member of a group feels when they are part of a group.
