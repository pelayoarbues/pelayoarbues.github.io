In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, companies face constant disruption and new challenges that can threaten their very existence. Generative AI and large language models are just the latest in a series of disruptions, and it is certain that they are just the beginning of new technologies related to data.

As Andrew Grove, former CEO of Intel, famously wrote in his book "Only the Paranoid Survive", a "paranoid" mindset is essential for companies to survive and thrive in this environment.

Being data paranoid means constantly monitoring the latest developments and applications of artificial intelligence and data techniques that may disrupt the market in which your company operates. This involves questioning assumptions, being willing to pivot strategies as needed, and seeking out new sources of data to inform decision-making and drive innovation. Companies that embrace a data paranoid mindset are better equipped to adapt and thrive in today's rapidly changing business landscape.
