Drawing an owl is no longer a daunting task. It's as simple as sketching a few circles, creating a prompt on [krea.ai](https://www.krea.ai/), Stable Diffusion, or any similar service. And voila, you're done!

Just as drawing an owl involves mastering the use of a pencil to achieve correct proportions, sensible shadows and lights, and intricate details, so too does 'Generating a dataset' present its own overlooked challenges.

It appears that [DALLÂ·E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3) has been trained successfully using captions by GPT (as per [LLMs, OpenAI Dev Day, and the Existential Crisis for Machine Learning Engineering - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTJHvgJtynU)).

However, the misconception lies in assuming that a powerful GPT is sufficient to generate synthetic datasets independently without needing further refinement. The brilliant team at [Argilla](https://argilla.io/) consistently [demonstrates](https://argilla.io/blog/notus7b) that high-quality, human-curated datasets are the key to success. 

This brings us to an intriguing question: what exactly constitutes good synthetic data?
