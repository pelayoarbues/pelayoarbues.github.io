Before making a decision we should analyse it and meta-decide whether that decision is reversible or not irreversible.

It is a mental model [proposed by Bezos at Amazon]([inc.com](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-this-is-how-successful-people-make-such-smart-decisions.html)) to know when a decision should be made quickly or if a deeper analysis is needed. 

Many irreversible decisions are made irrationally driven by necessity [having a sense of being in control of your life]([Quitting your job is the new divorcing your partner at 40 and becoming a 'runner'](https://www.elconfidencial.com/cultura/2022-05-01/dejar-trabajo-divorciarte-gran-renuncia_3416531/)).
