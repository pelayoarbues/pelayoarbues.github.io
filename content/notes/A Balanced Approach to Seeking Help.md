It's a common struggle for [new or recently onboarded employees](Data%20Science%20job%20crafting.md) to effectively navigate workplace roadblocks. When you first join a new role, it's easy to encounter obstacles - from troubleshooting tools to finding crucial information or tackling unfamiliar problems. However, how you respond to these challenges can make all the difference.

Typically, individuals tend to respond in one of two ways: either they hesitate to ask for help, or they seek assistance before trying to resolve the issue themselves. Both approaches can lead to issues down the line. 

Firstly, let's consider the pitfalls of not asking for help. As a newcomer, you're likely keen to [prove your worth and demonstrate your capabilities](Taming%20Impostor%20Syndrome.md). You may feel that showing any sign of weakness could undermine your credibility and you might be reluctant to spend your initial interactions with colleagues seeking assistance.

However, this mindset can be counterproductive. By refusing help, you're likely wasting valuable time and potentially delaying the moment when you become as efficient as your more experienced colleagues. This in turn affects them by not alleviating their workload. Moreover, you're missing an opportunity to engage with your team members and foster transparency – a key ingredient for any successful [team dynamic](Glue%20work.md). In essence, you're forfeiting an opportunity to truly integrate into your team.

On the flip side of this coin are those who immediately seek help upon encountering any issue. While less common, this too can cause problems as it undermines the principle of autonomy – an essential element for efficiency and speed in the long term. Colleagues also expect you to make a genuine effort to resolve minor issues on your own before seeking assistance.

So how do we strike a balance between these two extremes? The answer is simple: create a time budget when faced with a problem.

For instance, let's say you're having trouble getting CUDA working on a machine and are encountering some unusual errors. Instead of disappearing down a rabbit hole on Stackoverflow or spinning your wheels with your AI copilot, set yourself a deadline: "I'll spend the next two hours trying to solve this. If I'm still stuck, I'll seek help from my colleagues."

This self-imposed deadline helps you stay focused and often leads to a solution. When you do reach out, be sure to provide context - share the steps you've already taken and the errors you've encountered. This will help your colleagues quickly identify the root of the problem and provide more targeted assistance. They'll appreciate your proactive efforts and [feel like they're truly helping](Be%20helpful.md) to unblock you, rather than simply handing you the solution.

So next time you're faced with a challenge, make a pact with yourself to solve it within a set timeframe. If you're unsure how long to spend trying to figure it out on your own, don't hesitate to ask your manager or colleagues for guidance. They'll likely be more than willing to help remove that roadblock for you.
