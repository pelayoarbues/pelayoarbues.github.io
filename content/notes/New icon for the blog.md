I just designed a fresh icon for the blog using Midjourney 5.2, where I combined an obsidian rock and a neural network representation. This serves as a simple yet fitting depiction of how this site comes to life: by utilizing [Obsidian](notes/My%20workflow%20for%20my%20public%20second%20brain.md) and delving into data and Artificial Intelligence topics.

I must say, it turned out beautifully!
