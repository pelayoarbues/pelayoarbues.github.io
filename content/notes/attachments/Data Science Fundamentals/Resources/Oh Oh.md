Competence: Business Understanding
Level: Foundation

I guess this is one of the most difficult topics to teach and learn without being actually working at a company. And I also guess that you can only gain domain expertise in a sector by working on it.

I am afraid that I have only found bullshit content in this regard. I will keep on searching and keep you updated.

Meanwhile, if you are going to an interview or you have just recently started working on a new sector, make yourself a favor and start reading about data projects made by similar companies and read some general news about the industry. It will help you understand what fellow DS in similar businesses are trying to optimize ðŸ˜‰
