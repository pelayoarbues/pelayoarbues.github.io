I've noticed that, at times, the general public may find it challenging to grasp the concepts of precision and recall. The Covid pandemic has accustomed us to testing and, consequently, to news discussing prevalence, false positives, and false negatives. Although there was a time when this provided a fitting example for explaining these concepts, I no longer find it as engaging.

A few days ago, I stumbled upon an explanation on Twitter that cleverly used a narrative involving a detective, a village, innocent people, and criminals. I believe this game-like setting is an effective way to elucidate these concepts.
