As data professionals, we have a unique perspective on the company as a whole. From our position, we can see how all the departments and systems interconnect, which allows us to discover new opportunities. This is because companies are complex systems, and narrow, siloed views can prevent us from seeing the full potential of combining products and solutions.

However, this does not mean that we are smarter than other departments. Rather, we are in a good position to provide valuable insights that can benefit everyone in the company. For this reason, we should not keep this perspective exclusively to ourselves. Instead, we should provide discovery tools that allow other people to see the company from our vantage point, and benefit from the insights that we can offer.
