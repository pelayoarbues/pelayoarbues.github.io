The lack of clarity around the role of a data scientist can be a dangerous situation for candidates. This situation can make it difficult for candidates to know what is expected of them in their new role. Without a clear understanding of their role, they may struggle to perform their job to the best of their abilities, which can be frustrating for both the employee and the employer.

However, it can also be an opportunity for them to take control of their role and create a job that aligns with their values, interests, and skills. They can become the architects of their own job.

Choose your own adventure. You can rethink your job.
