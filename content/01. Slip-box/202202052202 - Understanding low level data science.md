Being able to understand the deep roots of the techniques allows you to truly grasp an idea of when to use them and even break the technique in pieces and use what you need. For instance I majored in spatial econometrics, a set of techniques to deal with spatial autocorrelation. I have not been able to use them at scale but they provide me the intuition to do spatial feature engineering in some of the projects I worked.

The risk of a superficial knowledge is becoming a library practitioner that just plugs libraries without too much thought. In some ocassions this might be ok. But in the long run it will cause that in some projects you take longer by adapting the library usage instead of just getting what you need and in the complex ones it won

However this does not guarantee a short term fast rise to the top. You need that those deep skills match your context. For instance, you might be an expert in deep learning in a company not applying it.
