Currently I am focused on:
- Devoting time to my wife and daughter.
- Learning about #management and how to apply Complex Problem Solving for leading change in organizations.
- Sharing publicly [my thoughts and learning path](digital-garden.md) in the Data Science field. 
- Learning about LLMs, [langchain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) and agents. 
- Using generative AI to revisit master photographers' work [instagram.com/somekindalovesomekindahate](https://www.instagram.com/somekindalovesomekindahate/)
- Staying fit by going at least three times a week to the gym.
