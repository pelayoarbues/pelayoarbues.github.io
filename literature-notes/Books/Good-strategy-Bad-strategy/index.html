A good strategy focuses energy and resources on very few pivotal objectives.</p><p>Another form of bad strategic objectives is to pursue unattainable objectives no one knows how to tackle with current resources and skills.</p><p><code>When a leader characterizes the challenge as underperformance, it set the stage for bad strategy. Underperformance is a result. The true challenges are the reasons of underperformance.</code></p><a href=#why-so-much-bad-strategy><h1 id=why-so-much-bad-strategy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Why so much bad strategy?</h1></a><p>Bad strategy is the result of:</p><ul><li>Unwillingness to choose: avoidance of taking decisions facing opportunity costs. Strategy requires focus and setting aside some goals. Universal buy-in might indicate the absence of choice. In organisations the older the inertia the larger resistance to change. See Arrow decision theory and Condorcet&rsquo;s paradox</li><li>Template style strategy. Max Weber&rsquo;s charismatic Vs formal leaders. Peter Drucker did not agree on the need of charisma to be an effective leader. Charismatic, transformational leadership has led to Template style strategic planning which usually involves things like vision, mission, values. This frees people to think on the true challenges they are trying to csolve.</li><li>Positive thinking displaces critical thinking and good strategy</li></ul><a href=#the-kernel-of-good-strategy><h1 id=the-kernel-of-good-strategy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The kernel of good strategy</h1></a><p>Elements</p><ul><li>Diagnosis: Describes the challenge. Answers the question &ldquo;What is it going on here?&rdquo;. So diagnosis is a judgement of facts, a simplified model that allows us to tackle complexity and advance in problem solving. This model focuses in factor that can be addressed with policy. **It is the why.</li><li>Guiding policy: Overall approach to face the challenge. Provides direction without explicitly defining what to do. Many people call strategy to guiding policy, but stating a diagnosis you can find alternative guiding policies. A good guiding policy tackles the challenge in the diagnosis by leveraging sources of advantage. It can be in itself an advantage, for instance by reducing the uncertainty of what to do, how to compete how to organise. It also helps focusing resources on specific set of challenge. **It is the what.</li><li>A set of coherent actions that carry out the guiding policy in a coordinated way. Strategy must decide priorities, and a great way to sharpen strategy is the necessity to act. We always hope that with a great design we can accomplish several conflicting objectives but the truth is that we need strategy to choose what to do and what to abandon. The coordination and coherence of action acts as a prominent source of advantage. Coherence imposed by a system by design, not adhoc, the kind of unnatural coordination that would not exists if it weren&rsquo;t without strategy. Centralization has many caveats (coordination interrupts and de specialized people, among others) but some benefits only appear if decisions are properly coordinated. **It is the how.</li></ul><a href=#part-ii-sources-of-power><h2 id=part-ii-sources-of-power><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part II Sources of power</h2></a><a href=#using-leverage><h1 id=using-leverage><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Using leverage</h1></a><p>Concentrate force, focus, energy and minds in pivotal objectives.</p><ul><li>Anticipation of market demand and competitors behaviour and reactions.</li><li>Pivotal objectives magnify the effects of focused energy and resources.</li><li>Concentration means that sometime focusing on a limited number of objectives you reach a threshold level (a critical level of effort necessary to affect the system). It is also wise to increase perceived effectiveness by concentrating on targets that catch attention.</li></ul><a href=#proximate-objectives><h1 id=proximate-objectives><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Proximate objectives</h1></a><p>Create feasible objectives with the skills and resources at hand. Sending man to the moon Vs the war on drugs.</p><ul><li>Solving ambiguity. Proximate objectives does wonders to organizational energy and focus. Challenges usually appear impossible because of complexity and uncertainty. A good leader can pass the organisation a simpler and solvable problem.</li><li>Taking a strong position and creating options. The more dynamic the situation the poorer your forecast. In uncertain scenarios make moves that improve your position and create opportunity.</li><li>Hierarchies of objectives. Your goal when you know how to crawl, must be to learn to walk. Once you learn to walk you can aim at running.</li></ul><a href=#chain-link-systems><h1 id=chain-link-systems><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chain-link systems</h1></a><p>Chain link systems are those limited by its weakest link. Once there exists a weak link ain&rsquo;t no point in strengthening the rest of the system.</p><ul><li>Getting stuck. Higher quality in a link that is not matched with higher quality in other links may cause worse results.</li><li>Getting unstuck. Quality matching in chain link systems requires working without inmediate returns.</li><li>Excellence. A well designed chain linked system is really difficult to replicate. For instance many IKEA policies are different from the norm (traditional furniture retailers does no carry large inventories, normal retailers don&rsquo;t do own designs or use catalogs instead of sales people) and work coherently in a chain like logic.

Prior guidance with design and planning in advance.</li><li>Anticipation. Of the thoughts and behaviours by others.</li><li>Design of coordinated action. Choreography of a designed plan. Strategists are designers working to solve a problem not decision makers that choose among different options that are presented to them.</li></ul><p>Design must find sweet spots which must balance with coordination among activities to make the whole strategy effective. Each part of the system must be reconsidered to the needs of the rest of the system. This means that design has to optimise performance while keeping in mind tradeoffs between capabilities and tight integration. The greater the challenge the greater need of resources or the greater the need for coherent, integrated, design-type strategy. Resources and integration are partial substitutes of each other. Integration costs are related to the difficulty to create tight integrations, narrower focus, more fragile and less responsiveness to change..</p><p>Potent resource position can eventually lead to produce profit without great effort.</p><blockquote><p>Easy life breed laxity: success leads to laxity that leads to decline</p></blockquote><p>Current profit is usually thought to be the result of current actions but it may be the harvest of planting seasons long past.</p><p>The challenger usually faces the incumbent by leveraging a tight design -type strategy.</p><blockquote><p>Most incumbent will loosen their tight integration and begin to rely more on accumulated resources and less on clever design. They will lose the discipline of tight integration, allowing independent fiefdoms to flourish and adding so many products and projects that integration becomes impossible. Faced with the natural slowing of growth over time, they will try to create the appearance of youthful vigor with bolt-on acquisitions. Then, when their resource base eventually becomes obsolete, they, too, will become prey to another generation of upstarts. It is the cycle of life.</p></blockquote><a href=#focus><h1 id=focus><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Focus</h1></a><p>In order to identify a company&rsquo;s strategy byou have to do your own analysis you cannot fully buy what HBR is telling.</p><p>To begin you usually start by examining the competitive environment.</p><p>Then look at each policy of the company and notice those that are different from the norm in the industry. We then try to distinguish the target they are trying to accomplish.</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">IMG_20220708_091247.jpg</a></p><p>Focus is the coordination of policies that produces extra power by interacting and overlapping effects. It denotes the application of that extra power to the right target.</p><p>Real world has an inner logic that is no secret but usually is under the radar. To spot the real strategy you must work hard analysing qualitative information.
Truth is that not all companies have a strategy. Strategy requires focus and many large companies pursue multiple goals at once without taking the max out of them.</p><a href=#growth><h1 id=growth><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Growth</h1></a><p>Growth by acquisition to ramp up KPIs without thoughtful strategy eventually leads to worse performance. Moreover when you buy a company, specially a public one you pay way too much.</p><p>Healthy growth it is the outcome of growing demand for special capabilities. It is the outcome of better products and services. The correct innovation processes usually leads to higher market share and a superior rate of profit.</p><a href=#using-advantage><h1 id=using-advantage><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Using advantage</h1></a><p>Advantage results from asymmetries from competition. No company or organisation can have advantages at everything. You must exploit where you have advantages and avoid situations you are weak.</p><p>You might be great at running 1500 meters, and you can do a good job running 10k, but probably you cannot wrestle a gorilla.</p><p>Porter&rsquo;s competitive advantage is either lower costs than your competitors, or greater perceived value for your customers or a combination of the two.</p><p>Sustainable competitive advantage requires that competitors cannot duplicate it. Isolating mechanisms are patents, reputation, network effects, huge economies of scale&mldr;</p><p>Competitive advantage is interesting when it can be updated, engineered and improved.</p><p>Wealth increases when competitive advantage increases and for that you need:</p><ul><li>Deepening advantages. This could be achieved by cutting costs via improving processes a la Taylor or by increasing value by improving products via product development.</li><li>Broadening the extent of advantages by applying them to new markets. Extending a competitive advantage requires building on your strengths. Extensions based on proprietary know how might even enhance knowledge. Extensions based on brand reputation are risky because they can damage the core. For instance, pirates of Caribbean extend Disney brand to adventure movies.</li><li>Creating higher demand for advantaged products or services. That higher demand might be because we add more users or because each buyer demands more. The process of engineering higher demand</li><li>Block easy replication by competitors. The value of your business can be increased by reducing the risk of imitative competition. Patents, copyrights and brand recognition are entry barriers. Also creating a moving target, a product that is constantly evolving (not saying improving, just moving) makes it more difficult to be imitated.</li></ul><a href=#using-dynamics><h1 id=using-dynamics><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Using dynamics</h1></a><p>Dramatical technical inventions and business model innovations create competitive advantages.</p><p>Another way is to exploit exogenous changes such as technology shifts, competition, politics and buyer perceptions. These changes might erode old advantages weakening existing leaders or enabling new ones.</p><p>The role of a leader is to ride waves of change and ensure the resources and innovation are channeled toward positions that will become advantages.</p><p>The importance is not in forecasting but in understanding past and present and to be able to take advantage of a wave of change. For instance, the basis of success lately is related to software written by small teams.</p><p>In order to really challenge the experts you need to deep dive into the details and understand the fundamentals.</p><p>In order to ride the waves of change you do not need to understand them completely right, just to do it better than your competitors.</p><p>Ways to understand industry transitions:</p><ul><li>Rising fixed costs: Growing fixed costs forces the industry to consolidate.</li><li>Deregulation: Changes in the rules that govern a market cause heavy modifications in the competitive landscape. Deregulated players and former monopolists are myopic of their actual costs so they might chase for years unprofitable market segments once the subsidies are gone.</li><li>Predictable biases: People usually do not see that surges in demand peak and the decline to normal levels.</li><li>Incumbent response: incumbents resist change and transition.</li><li>Attractor states: Potential efficient equilibrium that might be reach by the market.</li></ul><a href=#inertia-and-entropy><h1 id=inertia-and-entropy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Inertia and entropy</h1></a><p>Inertia is the inability to adapt to changing circumstances. Understanding the inertia of rival can create windows of opportunity to win a market.</p><ul><li>Inertia of routine. Standard routines define how an organisation process information and deal with change. You can overcome obsolete routines by hiring managers with better methods, or redesigning processes.a</li><li>Cultural inertia. Simplification helps breaking organizational culture inertia.</li><li>Inertia by proxy. Inertia created by old streams of profit when customers are too slow to replace products despite relative price or quality differences.</li></ul><p>Entropy affects weekly managed organizations that tends to become less organised and focused.</p><p>Organizational renewal helps reducing risks associated to inertia and entropy.</p><a href=#the-science-of-strategy><h1 id=the-science-of-strategy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The science of strategy</h1></a><p>A new strategy is a hypothesis and it&rsquo;s implementation, an experiment.</p><p>Functional knowledge is created by experimenting with different strategies.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://pelayoarbues.github.io/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Pelayo Arbués using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://pelayoarbues.github.io/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/pelayoarbues>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://sigmoid.social/@pelayoarbues>Mastodon</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/pelayoarbues/>Linkedin</a></li><li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WaC-GcIAAAAJ&hl">Scholar</a></li><li><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/wonderfulhorriblelife/>Flickr</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/pelayoarbues>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
