Once we see clearly what’s going on in the moment, we can then choose whether and how to act on what we’re seeing. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=260" rel=noopener>Location 260</a>)</li><li>whatever gets our attention flourishes, so if we lavish attention on the negative and inconsequential, they can overwhelm the positive and the meaningful. But if we do the opposite, refusing to deal with or acknowledge what’s difficult and painful, pretending it doesn’t exist, then our world is out of whack. Whatever doesn’t get our attention withers—or retreats below conscious awareness, where it may still affect our lives. In a perverse way, ignoring the painful and the difficult is just another way of feeding the wolf. Meditation teaches us to open our attention to all of human experience and all parts of ourselves. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=282" rel=noopener>Location 282</a>)</li><li>the feeling of having your attention fractured by job and family, the enticement of electronic diversions, or the chatter of your mind—that morning’s spat with your mate replaying in your head, a litany of worries about the future or regrets about the past, a nervous endless-loop recitation of the day’s to-do list. Parts of that mental soundtrack may be old tapes that were instilled in childhood and have been playing so long we’ve nearly tuned them out of conscious awareness. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=287" rel=noopener>Location 287</a>)</li><li>Meditation teaches us to focus and to pay clear attention to our experiences and responses as they arise, and to observe them without judging them. That allows us to detect harmful habits of mind that were previously invisible to us. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=300" rel=noopener>Location 300</a>)</li><li>All forms of meditation strengthen and direct our attention through the cultivation of three key skills—concentration, mindfulness, and compassion or lovingkindness. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=306" rel=noopener>Location 306</a>)</li><li>The practice entails paying attention to each in-and-out breath, and when your mind wanders (it will, that’s natural), noticing whatever has captured your attention, then letting go of the thought or feeling without berating yourself for it. You then return to focusing on your breathing. In this way meditation trains us to stay in the moment before us instead of reliving the past or worrying about the future. And it teaches us how to be gentle with ourselves and others, to forgive our lapses and move (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=310" rel=noopener>Location 310</a>)</li><li>But if we apply mindfulness to the experience of anger, we can safely draw close to the emotion instead of fleeing, and investigate it instead of stonewalling. We notice it without judging it. We can gather more information about what happens when we get mad—what sets off the anger, where it lodges in the body, and what else it also contains, like sadness, fear, or regret. This pause for nonjudgmental acknowledgment creates a bit of peaceful space within which we can make new, different choices about how to respond to something like anger. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=324" rel=noopener>Location 324</a>)</li><li>Mindfulness helps us get better at seeing the difference between what’s happening and the stories we tell ourselves about what’s happening, stories that get in the way of direct experience. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=331" rel=noopener>Location 331</a>)</li><li>If you meditate regularly, you also get certain results. I’ve already mentioned some of them, including greater calm, and improved concentration and more connection to others. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=395" rel=noopener>Location 395</a>)<ul><li>Tags: <a class="internal-link broken">favorite</a></li></ul></li><li>You’ll begin to spot the unexamined assumptions that get in the way of happiness. These assumptions we make about who we are and the way the world works—what we deserve, how much we can handle, where happiness is to be found, whether or not positive change is possible—all greatly influence how and to what we pay attention. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=398" rel=noopener>Location 398</a>)</li><li>Assumptions block direct experience and prevent us from gathering information that could bring us comfort and relief, or information that, though saddening and painful, will allow us to make better decisions. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=406" rel=noopener>Location 406</a>)</li><li>You’ll stop limiting yourself. When we practice meditation, we often begin to recognize a specific sort of conditioned response—previously undetected restrictions we’ve imposed on our lives. We spot the ways we sabotage our own growth and success because we’ve been conditioned to be content with meager results. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=414" rel=noopener>Location 414</a>)</li><li>You’ll weather hard times better. Meditation teaches us safe ways to open ourselves to the full range of experience—painful, pleasurable, and neutral—so we can learn how to be a friend to ourselves in good times and bad. During meditation sessions we practice being with difficult emotions and thoughts, even frightening or intense ones, in an open and accepting way, without adding self-criticism to something that already hurts. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=421" rel=noopener>Location 421</a>)</li><li>You’ll rediscover a deeper sense of what’s really important to you. Once you look beneath distractions and conditioned reactions, you’ll have a clearer view of your deepest, most enduring dreams, goals, and values. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=429" rel=noopener>Location 429</a>)</li><li>You’ll have a portable emergency resource. Meditation is the ultimate mobile device; you can use it anywhere, anytime, unobtrusively. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=431" rel=noopener>Location 431</a>)</li><li>You’ll be in closer touch with the best parts of yourself. Meditation practice cultivates qualities such as kindness, trust, and wisdom that you may think are missing from your makeup but are actually just undeveloped or obscured by stress and distractions. You’ll have the chance to access these qualities more easily and frequently. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=435" rel=noopener>Location 435</a>)</li><li>You’ll recapture the energy you’ve been wasting trying to control the uncontrollable. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=438" rel=noopener>Location 438</a>)</li><li>Though we can affect our physical and emotional experiences, we can’t ultimately determine them; we can’t decree what emotions will arise within us. But we can learn through meditation to change our responses to them. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=447" rel=noopener>Location 447</a>)</li><li>Recognizing what we can’t control (the feelings that arise within us; other people; the weather) helps us have healthier boundaries at work and at home—no more trying to reform everyone all the time. It helps us to stop beating up on ourselves for having perfectly human emotions. It frees energy we expend on trying to control the uncontrollable. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=449" rel=noopener>Location 449</a>)</li><li>You’ll understand how to relate to change better—to accept that it’s inevitable and believe that it’s possible. Most of us have a mixed, often paradoxical attitude toward change. Some of us don’t think change is possible at all; we believe we’re stuck forever doing things the way we’ve always done them. Some of us simultaneously hope for change and fear it. We want to believe that change is possible, because that means that our lives can get better. But we also have trouble accepting change, because we want to hold on permanently to what’s pleasurable and positive. We’d like difficulties to be fleeting and comfort to stick around. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=452" rel=noopener>Location 452</a>)</li><li>Everything is impermanent: happiness, sorrow, a great meal, a powerful empire, what we’re feeling, the people around us, ourselves. Meditation helps us comprehend this fact—perhaps the basic truth of human existence, and the one we humans are most likely to balk at or be oblivious to, especially when it comes to the biggest change of all: Mortality happens, whether we like it or not. We grow old and die. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=458" rel=noopener>Location 458</a>)</li><li>Following our breath while observing how thoughts continually ebb and flow can help us realize that all elements of our experience are in constant flux. During a meditation session, you’ll find it’s natural to go through many ups and downs, to encounter both new delights and newly awakened conflicts that have bubbled up from the unconscious mind. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=464" rel=noopener>Location 464</a>)</li><li>We can’t control what thoughts and emotions arise within us, nor can we control the universal truth that everything changes. But we can learn to step back and rest in the awareness of what’s happening. That awareness can be our refuge. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=475" rel=noopener>Location 475</a>)</li><li>“I’ve been through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened,” Mark Twain once said. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=601" rel=noopener>Location 601</a>)</li><li>Meditation—training our attention—allows us to find an essential cohesiveness. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=637" rel=noopener>Location 637</a>)</li><li>Thoughts and feelings will inevitably arise and claim your attention, but you’ll practice repeatedly noticing and letting go of these distractions, then returning your awareness to the in and out of your breath. Breathing, discovering you’ve been distracted, and starting over: simple and manageable. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=694" rel=noopener>Location 694</a>)</li><li>Some of these thoughts and feelings may be fascinating and delightful; some may make you uncomfortable; some may be deadly dull. You’ll practice letting them all go, without taking the time to judge them. This is a crucial first step in learning how to be more centered and present. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IARYIY&location=696" rel=noopener>Location 696</a>)</li><li>Everyone who meditates, beginners and longer-term practitioners alike, gets hijacked at times by thoughts and feelings; it’s impossible not to be. But once you see how doable it is to start over, you won’t judge your efforts so harshly. And you’ll learn that starting over and not fruitlessly berating yourself are skills you can bring into your everyday life when you’ve made a mistake or lost sight of your aspirations.

But every time he put down his foot, there was another step, and his shadow kept up with him without the slightest difficulty. He thought he must not be running fast enough. So he ran faster and faster and faster, without stopping, until he finally dropped dead of exhaustion. He failed to realize that if he merely stepped into the shade, his shadow would vanish, and if he sat down and stayed still, there would be no more footsteps. (

We sometimes call meditation non-doing. Instead of being swept away by our usual conditioned reactions, we’re quiet and watchful, fully present with what is, touching it deeply, being touched by it, and seeing what is happening in the simplest and most direct fashion possible.

I like to quote Thich Nhat Hanh: “To dwell in the here and now does not mean you never think about the past or responsibly plan for the future,” he says. “The idea is simply not to allow yourself to get lost in regrets about the past or worries about the future. If you are firmly grounded in the present moment, the past can be an object of inquiry, the object of your mindfulness and concentration. You can attain many insights by looking into the past. But you are still grounded in the present moment.” (

Whatever doesn’t get our attention withers—or retreats below conscious awareness, where it may still affect our lives. In a perverse way, ignoring the painful and the difficult is just another way of feeding the wolf. Meditation teaches us to open our attention to all of human experience and all parts of ourselves. (

Some of us simultaneously hope for change and fear it. We want to believe that change is possible, because that means that our lives can get better.

But every time he put down his foot, there was another step, and his shadow kept up with him without the slightest difficulty. He thought he must not be running fast enough. So he ran faster and faster and faster, without stopping, until he finally dropped dead of exhaustion. He failed to realize that if he merely stepped into the shade, his shadow would vanish, and if he sat down and stayed still, there would be no more footsteps. (

We sometimes call meditation non-doing. Instead of being swept away by our usual conditioned reactions, we’re quiet and watchful, fully present with what is, touching it deeply, being touched by it, and seeing what is happening in the simplest and most direct fashion possible.

I like to quote Thich Nhat Hanh: “To dwell in the here and now does not mean you never think about the past or responsibly plan for the future,” he says. “The idea is simply not to allow yourself to get lost in regrets about the past or worries about the future. If you are firmly grounded in the present moment, the past can be an object of inquiry, the object of your mindfulness and concentration. You can attain many insights by looking into the past. But you are still grounded in the present moment.” (

Whatever doesn’t get our attention withers—or retreats below conscious awareness, where it may still affect our lives. In a perverse way, ignoring the painful and the difficult is just another way of feeding the wolf. Meditation teaches us to open our attention to all of human experience and all parts of ourselves. (

Some of us simultaneously hope for change and fear it. We want to believe that change is possible, because that means that our lives can get better. But we also have trouble accepting change, because we want to hold on permanently to what’s pleasurable and positive. We’d like difficulties to be fleeting and comfort to stick around. (

So he ran faster and faster and faster, without stopping, until he finally dropped dead of exhaustion. He failed to realize that if he merely stepped into the shade, his shadow would vanish, and if he sat down and stayed still, there would be no more footsteps. (

Whatever doesn’t get our attention withers—or retreats below conscious awareness, where it may still affect our lives. In a perverse way, ignoring the painful and the difficult is just another way of feeding the wolf. Meditation teaches us to open our attention to all of human experience and all parts of ourselves. (

Most of us have a mixed, often paradoxical attitude toward change. Some of us don’t think change is possible at all; we believe we’re stuck forever doing things the way we’ve always done them. Some of us simultaneously hope for change and fear it. We want to believe that change is possible, because that means that our lives can get better. But we also have trouble accepting change, because we want to hold on permanently to what’s pleasurable and positive. We’d like difficulties to be fleeting and comfort to stick around. (
