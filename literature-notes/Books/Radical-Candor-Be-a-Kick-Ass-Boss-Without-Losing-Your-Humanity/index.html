(Location 26)</li><li>In an effort to create a positive, stress-free environment, I sidestepped the difficult but necessary part of being a boss: telling people clearly and directly when their work wasn’t good enough. I failed to create a climate in which people who weren’t getting the job done were told so in time to fix it. (Location 30)</li><li>he knew his work wasn’t good, and so my false praise just messed with his mind. It allowed him to deceive himself into thinking that he could continue along the same course. Which he did. By failing to confront the problem, I’d removed the incentive for him to try harder and lulled him into thinking he’d be fine. (Location 50)</li><li>It’s brutally hard to tell people when they are screwing up. You don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings; that’s because you’re not a sadist. (Location 52)</li><li>kept making the same mistake over and over for ten months. As you probably know, for every piece of subpar work you accept, for every missed deadline you let slip, you begin to feel resentment and then anger. You no longer just think the work is bad: you think the person is bad. This makes it harder to have an even-keeled conversation. You start to avoid talking to the person at all. (Location 56)</li><li>the impact of my behavior with Bob didn’t stop with him: others on the team wondered why I accepted such poor work. (Location 59)</li><li>Covering for people is sometimes necessary for a short period of time— say, if somebody is going through a crisis. But when it goes on too long it starts to take a toll. People whose work had been exceptional started to get sloppy. We missed key deadlines. Knowing why Bob’s colleagues were late, I didn’t give them too hard a time. Then they began to wonder if I knew the difference between great and mediocre; perhaps I didn’t even take the missed deadlines seriously. As is often the case when people are not sure if the quality of what they are doing is appreciated, the results began to suffer, and so did morale. (Location 61)</li><li>Lack of praise and criticism had absolutely disastrous effects on the team and on our outcomes. (Location 74)</li><li>You can draw a straight line from lack of guidance to a dysfunctional team that gets poor results. (Location 74)</li><li>Silicon Valley, you don’t fall down; you fall up.” (Location 84)</li><li>Rather than focus on “giving feedback” to my team, I encouraged them to tell me when I was wrong. I did everything I could to encourage people to criticize me, or at least simply to talk to (Location 97)</li><li>We were obsessive about efficiency, and we managed to shrink headcount in North America even as revenue grew dizzyingly— the definition of scaling. (Location 108)</li><li>Apple U’s mandate like this: “We want to defy the gravitational pull of organizational mediocrity.” (Location 119)</li><li>Then a leader at Apple pointed out to me that all teams need stability as well as growth to function properly; nothing works well if everyone is gunning for the next promotion. (Location 126)</li><li>She called the people on her team who got exceptional results but who were on a more gradual growth trajectory “rock stars” because they were like the Rock of Gibraltar on her team. These people loved their work and were world-class at it, but they didn’t want her job or to be Steve Jobs. They were happy where they were. The people who were on a steeper growth trajectory— the ones who’d go crazy if they were still doing the same job in a year— she called “superstars.” They were the source of growth on any team. She was explicit about needing a balance of both. (Location 127)</li><li>Apple made room for people with all sorts of different ambitions. You had to be great at what you did and you had to love your work, but you did not have to be promotion-obsessed to have a fulfilling career at Apple. (Location 132)</li><li>“At Apple we hire people to tell us what to do, not the other way around.” (Location 144)</li><li>a boss’s ability to achieve results had a lot more to do with listening and seeking to understand than it did with telling people what to do; more to do with debating than directing; more to do with pushing people to decide than with being the decider; more to do with persuading than with giving orders; more to do with learning than with knowing. (Location 146)</li><li>“You need to do that in a way that does not call into question your confidence in their abilities but leaves not too much room for interpretation &mldr; and that’s a hard thing to do.” He went on to say, “I don’t mind being wrong. And I’ll admit that I’m wrong a lot. It doesn’t really matter to me too much. What matters to me is that we do the right thing.” (Location 152)</li><li>My point is not that you need to cuss or shout or be rude to be a great boss. In fact, I wouldn’t recommend it, because even if your relationship evolves to the point where you think mutual respect is understood, as boss you sometimes just misread signals. The point is, rather, that if you are someone who is most comfortable communicating in that way, you have to build relationships of trust that can support it, and you have to hire people who can adapt to your style. (Location 168)</li><li>the reason why Silicon Valley turned out to be a good place to study the relationships between bosses and the people who report to them is that the war for “talent” there is intense. (Location 177)</li><li>the relationships you have with your direct reports will impact the relationships they have with their direct reports. The ripple effect will go a long way toward creating— or destroying— a positive culture. Relationships may not scale, but culture does. (Location 184)</li><li>at the very heart of being a good boss— at Apple, at Google, or anywhere else on earth— is a good relationship. The term I found that best describes this relationship is Radical Candor. (Location 191)</li><li>no matter how supportive the environment, bosses often feel alone. (Location 196)</li><li>you might occasionally feel overwhelmed by the number of things I’m suggesting you do as a manager. Take a deep breath. My goal is to save you time, not to litter your calendar with meetings. You do need to spend time with your direct reports to be a great boss, but you don’t need to spend ALL your time with them. If you implement every single idea, tool, and technique in this book, the time you dedicate to managing your team will come to approximately ten hours a week, and those ten hours should save you enormous lost time and headaches later. I’ll also suggest you block out about fifteen hours a week for you to think and execute independently in your area of expertise. That leaves another fifteen hours in a forty-hour work week. Hopefully you can claim them as your own, though if you’re like me you’ll have to use most of them to deal with the unpredictable. (Location 205)</li><li>managers typically make the same mistakes over and over again. Despite the predictability, successful intervention proved dishearteningly elusive. (Location 212)</li><li>“This is not babysitting,” she said. “It’s called management, and it is your job!” (Location 246)</li><li>Every time I feel I have something more “important” to do than listen to people, I remember Leslie’s words: “It is your job!” (Location 247)</li><li>We undervalue the “emotional labor” of being the boss. That term is usually reserved for people who work in the service or health industry: psychiatrists, nurses, doctors, waiters, flight attendants. But as I will show in the pages to come, this emotional labor is not just part of the job; it’s the key to being a good boss. (Location 249)</li><li>many people feel they aren’t as good at management as they are at the “real” part of the job. Often, they fear they are failing the people who report to them. (Location 261)</li><li>most people don’t like the words for their role: “boss” evokes injustice, “manager” sounds bureaucratic, “leader” sounds self-aggrandizing. I prefer the word “boss” because the distinctions between leadership and management tend to define leaders as BSers who don’t actually do anything and managers as petty executors. (Location 264)</li><li>management and leadership are like forehand and backhand. You have to be good at both to win. (Location 269)</li><li>bosses are responsible for results. They achieve these results not by doing all the work themselves but by guiding the people on their teams. Bosses guide a team to achieve results. (Location 273)</li><li>three areas of responsibility that managers do have: guidance, team-building, and results. (Location 275)</li><li>Guidance is often called “feedback.” People dread feedback— both the praise, which can feel patronizing, and especially the criticism. (Location 276)</li><li>Building a cohesive team means figuring out the right people for the right roles: hiring, firing, promoting. But once you’ve got the right people in the right jobs, how do you keep them motivated? (Location 282)</li><li>results. Many managers are perpetually frustrated that it seems harder than it should be to get things done. (Location 287)</li><li>Guidance, team, and results: these are the responsibilities of any boss. This is equally true for anyone who manages people— CEOs, middle managers, and first-time leaders. (Location 293)</li><li>establishing a trusting relationship with each person who reports directly to you. If you lead a big organization, you can’t have a relationship with everyone; but you can really get to know the people who report directly to you. Many things get in the way, though: power dynamics first and foremost, but also fear of conflict, worry about the boundaries of what’s appropriate or “professional,” fear of losing credibility, time pressure. (Location 302)</li><li>If you think that you can do these things without strong relationships, you are kidding yourself. (Location 308)</li><li>You strengthen your relationships by learning the best ways to get, give, and encourage guidance; by putting the right people in the right roles on your team; and by achieving results collectively that you couldn’t dream of individually. (Location 311)</li><li>When you fail to give people the guidance they need to succeed in their work, or put people into roles they don’t want or aren’t well-suited for, or push people to achieve results they feel are unrealistic, you erode trust. (Location 313)</li><li>Your relationships with your direct reports affect the relationships they have with their direct reports, and your team’s culture. Your ability to build trusting, human connections with the people who report directly to you will determine the quality of everything that follows. (Location 317)</li><li>The first dimension is about being more than “just professional.” It’s about giving a damn, sharing more than just your work self, and encouraging everyone who reports to you to do the same. It’s not enough to care only about people’s ability to perform a job. To have a good relationship, you have to be your whole self and care about each of the people who work for you as a human being. It’s not just business; it is personal, and deeply personal. I call this dimension “Care Personally.” (Location 325)</li><li>The second dimension involves telling people when their work isn’t good enough— and when it is; (Location 328)</li><li>Challenging people generally pisses them off, and at first that doesn’t seem like a good way to build a relationship or to show that you “care personally.” And yet challenging people is often the best way to show them that you care when you’re the boss. This dimension I call “Challenge Directly.” (Location 332)</li><li>“Radical Candor” is what happens when you put “Care Personally” and “Challenge Directly” together. Radical Candor builds trust and opens the door for the kind of communication that helps you achieve the results you’re aiming for. (Location 334)</li><li>It turns out that when people trust you and believe you care about them, they are much more likely to 1) accept and act on your praise and criticism; 2) tell you what they really think about what you are doing well and, more importantly, not doing so well; 3) engage in this same behavior with one another, meaning less pushing the rock up the hill again and again; 4) embrace their role on the team; and 5) focus on getting results. (Location 337)</li><li>The most surprising thing about Radical Candor may be that its results are often the opposite of what you fear. You fear people will become angry or vindictive; instead they are usually grateful for the chance to talk it through. (Location 346)</li><li>I realized the question that led me to study Russian literature— why some people live productively and joyfully while others feel, as Marx put it, alienated from their labor— was central to a boss’s job.

(Location 376)</li><li>Part of the reason why people fail to “care personally” is the injunction to “keep it professional.” That phrase denies something essential. We are all human beings, with human feelings, and, even at work, we need to be seen as such. When that doesn’t happen, when we feel we must repress who we really are to earn a living, we become alienated. That makes us hate going to work. To most bosses, being professional means: show up at work on time, do your job, don’t show feelings (unless engaged in “motivation” or some such end-driven effort). The result is that nobody feels comfortable being who they really are at work. (Location 379)</li><li>Bringing your whole self to work is one of those concepts that’s hard to define precisely, but you develop a feel for it when you start to open up to it. This often means modeling the behavior yourself by showing some vulnerability to the people who report to you— or just admitting when you’re having a bad day— and creating a safe space for others to do the same.

That’s why I detest the word “superior” as a synonym for “boss.” I also avoid the word “employee.” (Location 392)</li><li>Caring personally is the antidote to both robotic professionalism and managerial arrogance. Why do I say “caring personally” instead of just “caring”? Because it’s not enough to care about the person’s work or the person’s career. Only when you actually care about the whole person with your whole self can you build a relationship. (Location 396)</li><li>It’s about acknowledging that we are all people with lives and aspirations that extend beyond those related to our shared work.

(Location 409)</li><li>Challenging others and encouraging them to challenge you helps build trusting relationships because it shows 1) you care enough to point out both the things that aren’t going well and those that are and that 2) you are willing to admit when you’re wrong and that you are committed to fixing mistakes that you or others have made. (Location 418)</li><li>being responsible sometimes means pissing people off. 1 You have to accept that sometimes people on your team will be mad at you. In fact, if nobody is ever mad at you, you probably aren’t challenging your team enough. (Location 421)</li><li>When what you say hurts, acknowledge the other person’s pain. Don’t pretend it doesn’t hurt or say it “shouldn’t” hurt— just show that you care. Eliminate the phrase “don’t take it personally” from your vocabulary— it’s insulting. Instead, offer to help fix the problem. But don’t pretend it isn’t a problem just to try to make somebody feel better. (Location 424)</li><li>The hardest part of building this trust is inviting people to challenge you, just as directly as you are challenging them.

Go deep into the details. (Location 762)</li><li>There are several reasons why it makes sense to begin building a culture of Radical Candor by asking people to criticize you. First, it’s the best way to show that you are aware that you are often wrong, and that you want to hear about it when you are; you want to be challenged. Second, you’ll learn a lot— few people scrutinize you as closely as do those who report to you. Maybe it will prevent you from sending out ill-conceived emails like the one I sent to Larry. Third, the more firsthand experience you have with how it feels to receive criticism, the better idea you’ll have of how your own guidance lands for others. Fourth, asking for criticism is a great way to build trust and strengthen your relationships. (Location 770)</li><li>If you see somebody criticizing a peer inappropriately, say something.

Wanting to combat the cultural taboos against criticizing management, Toyota’s leaders painted a big red square on the assembly line floor.

(Location 792)</li><li>Balance praise and criticism Worry more about praise, less about criticism— but above all be sincere We learn more from our mistakes than our successes, more from criticism than from praise. Why, then, is it important to give more praise than criticism? Several reasons. First, it guides people in the right direction. It’s just as important to let people know what to do more of as what to do less of. Second, it encourages people to keep improving. In other words, the best praise does a lot more than just make people feel good. It can actually challenge them directly. (Location 799)</li><li>When I am criticizing, I try to be less nervous, and focus on “just saying it.” If I think too much about how to say it I’m likely to wimp out and say nothing.

It’s not about becoming a manager— plenty of individual contributors remain on a steep growth trajectory their entire careers, and plenty of managers are on a gradual growth trajectory.

This was directly tied to the company’s efforts to limit the power of managers to quash rather than accelerate the careers of people on a steep growth trajectory. (Location 1229)</li><li>Bosses at Google can’t simply promote people on their teams at their own discretion. In engineering, managers can encourage or discourage a person from pursuing another job, and they can lobby for the person or not, but people nominate themselves for promotion, and a committee makes the decision. Once a “promotion packet” consisting of a list of accomplishments and recommendations has been assembled, a committee reads it and decides if the promotion should go through. The manager is not on that committee. The manager can appeal a decision, but the manager is not the decider. This prevents managers from curbing the ambition of their direct reports or from offering promotions to reward personal loyalty rather than great work.

This has been great for the growth of these engineers; it’s also good for the people whom they would otherwise have been managing. When people become bosses just to “get ahead” rather than because they want to do what bosses do, they perform, at best, a perfunctory job and often become bosses from hell.

If their work still continued to be mediocre, we began encouraging these people to look for jobs elsewhere.

Have you demonstrated to Peggy that you care personally about her work and her life, and have you been crystal clear when you have challenged her to improve? Has your praise been substantive and specific about what she has done right, rather than simply a salve to her ego? Have you been humble as well as direct in your criticism, offering to help her find solutions rather than attacking her as a person? And have you done these things on multiple occasions over the course of time? If the answer is yes and you have not seen improvement, or have seen only flickers of improvement, it’s time.

As a manager, it’s your job to make sure you understand everyone else’s perspective, as well, and how her poor performance affects other members of the team. Generally, by the time one of your direct report’s poor performance has come to your attention, it’s been driving their peers nuts for a long time.

If you don’t have a pretty precise answer to those questions, it probably won’t get better. (Location 1326)</li></ol></li><li>Somebody is better than nobody. Another common reason why bosses are reluctant to fire a poor performer is that they don’t want a “hole” on the team. If you fire “Jeffrey,” who will do the work he was doing? How long will it take you to find a replacement? The fact is that poor performers often create as much extra work for others as they accomplish themselves, because they leave parts of their job undone or do other parts sloppily or behave unprofessionally in ways that others must compensate for. Steve Jobs put it succinctly, if harshly, when he said, “It’s better to have a hole than an asshole.” (Location 1329)</li><li>A transfer is the answer. Because firing people is so very hard, it’s often tempting to instead pass them off to an unsuspecting colleague at your company, even if they don’t have skills your colleague needs or are a poor cultural fit. It feels “nicer” than firing them. This is obviously not so nice for the unsuspecting colleague and is generally a mistake for the person you’re trying to be “nice” to as well. (Location 1334)</li><li>It’s bad for morale. It’s also tempting to tell yourself that you’re not firing somebody because doing so would discourage the team. But keeping someone on who can’t do the job is far worse for morale— yours, the person who’s doing a crummy job, and everyone else who’s doing a great job. Again, this comes down to having built a good relationship with the person you’re firing, and the rest of the team. It comes back to having demonstrated that you care personally. (Location 1338)</li><li>The way you fire people really matters, and to do this hard job well, it’s important not to distance yourself from the person you’re about to fire. If you try to avoid feeling the pain that is inherent in the situation, especially for the person you’re firing, you’ll make a hash of it.

As my grandmother once said to me, “There’s a lid for every pot.” Just because the person is not good at the job they do for you doesn’t mean there isn’t another job out there they could be great at. I know that this can sound very Pollyanna-ish, so before our meeting, I try to imagine specifically what that job might be. I also try to reframe the problem, for both me and the person I’m firing: it’s not the person who sucks, it’s the job that sucks— at least for this person.

Since not everyone will have been involved in the listen-clarify-debate-decide part of the cycle for every idea, the next step is to bring the broader team along. You have to persuade those who weren’t involved in a decision that it was a good one, so that everyone can execute it effectively.

When they ask, “Why are we doing this, it makes no sense to us, didn’t you argue?” you can reply, “I understand your perspective. Yes, I did have an opportunity to argue. Here’s what I said. And here is what I learned about why we are doing what we are doing.” If they insist on knowing whether you agree, you can tell them in all honesty that your boss listened to your point of view, that you were given an opportunity to challenge the decisions, and that now it’s time to commit to a different course of action than the one you were arguing for.

(Location 2949)</li><li>if your company doesn’t require a 360 process so that you learn what other people think of your direct report’s performance, you can still do a sanity check. One manager I know does this by simply asking each person on the team to give their peers a √ −, √, √ +. Most people get a √, and if they do that’s the end of the conversation. If one person gives a peer a √ − or a √ +, he asks a couple more questions.

The main advantage here was that it made the review feel more like a two-way conversation and less like an arrogant one-way judgment.

But it’s happened to me dozens of times that writing things down changes the review. I think I know what I want to say during a review, and then when I start to write it down, I realize that the situation is much more nuanced, upon reflection. Taking the time to articulate your thinking on paper beforehand can spare you the awkwardness of having to backpedal in the middle of a review, or after you’ve delivered it.

The idea was to get people from the team to stand up and talk about some extraordinary work they’d seen somebody else do. The winner of the whale the previous week decided who deserved the whale this week. Next, people nominated themselves for “Whoops the Monkey.” If anyone screwed up that week, they could stand up, tell the story, get automatic forgiveness, and help prevent somebody else from making the same mistake. (Location 3021)</li><li>What if, instead of suing doctors who made honest mistakes we gave them immunity, collected and shared the information, and came up with ways to help other doctors avoid making the same mistakes? If we made it safer for doctors to give each other guidance, and to learn from each other’s mistakes, the impact could be enormous. (Location 3043)</li><li>Another good way to get people talking to each other is to explain the Radical Candor framework to your team. (Location 3046)</li><li>“skip level meetings.” In these meetings, which need to happen only once a year to be effective, you will meet with the people who work for your direct reports, without your direct reports in the room, and ask what they could do or stop doing to be better bosses. (Location 3050)</li><li>The best way to lower the barriers that hierarchy puts between us is to admit that it exists and think of ways to make sure everyone feels they are on an equal footing at a human level despite the structure. To make sure everyone feels free to “speak truth to power.” (Location 3054)</li><li>that most people are very reluctant to criticize their boss. Plus, managers, especially new managers, will consciously or unconsciously seek to repress criticism rather than to encourage it. (Location 3057)</li><li>You have to be really careful with skip level meetings. They can turn into gripe sessions, and it must be clear that you aren’t automatically presuming that the boss, your direct report, is guilty, or that you’re unwilling to hear any criticism of your direct report. The intent of these sessions is to be supportive of the managers who report to you, not to undermine them. And part of being supportive is knowing when they are screwing up, and helping them address the situation. (Location 3059)</li><li>Explain it. Show it. Explain it again. Explain to each of your direct reports that you have two goals: 1) to help each of them become better bosses and 2) to make sure people on their team feel comfortable giving them feedback directly. (Location 3065)</li><li>Never have a skip level meeting without prior consent of your direct report. Instead, ask the managers who report to you to explain the whole thing to their teams beforehand. (Location 3068)</li><li>It’s vital that everyone understands that the meeting with you is in support of, not an attack on, their boss. Then, when you begin the meeting, reiterate that the goal of the meeting is to help the boss get better. (Location 3069)</li><li>never have skip level meetings for some of the people who work for you but not others. It must be clear that this is a routine process undertaken for anyone who has direct reports. If you have skip level meetings only when there are problems on a team, then they will become a punishment rather than a welcome tool to help people develop their management skills. (Location 3073)</li><li>everything of import will be shared with their boss, but not who said it. (Location 3077)</li><li>Project the notes you take during the meeting, and let people know that you will share them with the manager. (Location 3079)</li><li>It is important to take the notes yourself, rather than asking somebody else to do it. First, it shows you are listening and engaged. Second, it’s a great way to learn when you misunderstand something. (Location 3081)</li><li>The first of these meetings is often incredibly awkward. You’ll have to work hard to earn the trust of everyone in the room. Generally, it’s easiest to start with praise to get people talking, “What is your manager doing well?” Then, “What could your manager be doing better?” Then, “What really sucks?” (Location 3083)</li><li>When there are about eight minutes left in the meeting, ask everyone to look at the notes, reminding them that you’ll be sharing the document with their boss momentarily. (Location 3090)</li><li>This has a way of focusing the conversation and making people feel accountable for their suggestions. The immediacy— you’re going to share this with the person you were talking about eight minutes from now!— makes the conversation feel less like it is happening behind the person’s back. (Location 3091)</li><li>Ensure that your directs make and communicate changes. Once your direct reports have read the notes you’ve gathered, work with each to come up with one or two specific things they can immediately change. It mustn’t be something big and vague like, “Improve my relationships.” Much better if it’s something smaller but more tangible like, “I will disagree in person, not over email.” (Location 3097)</li><li>Encourage each of your direct reports to send an email out to their teams explaining what they have learned and what they are going to do differently as a result, and to cc you on the note. (Location 3099)</li><li>The more visible the change, the better. Review these changes in a follow-up to the skip level meeting, and encourage the team to tell you whether or not they made a difference. If people feel that no changes were made, or that the meeting didn’t make a difference, treat this very seriously. (Location 3102)</li><li>Have these meetings once a year for each of your direct reports. The biggest problem with skip level meetings is that when they start going well, everybody wants them all the time, and you can get skip level proliferation. (Location 3105)</li><li>Remind people that personality transplants are not available. (Location 3121)</li><li>Be careful not to judge or defend the manager about whom you are soliciting feedback. If it feels as though you are fishing for reasons to punish the boss in question, either people will clam up or a gripe session will ensue. Make it clear that your role is not to judge but to pass along the feedback. If you encounter a really big problem, promise to look into it more deeply.

(Location 3139)</li><li>you want a balance, so that you have both people who push for change and those who offer stability. And to understand what motivates the different people you work with, you need to have Radically Candid relationships with each. (Location 3142)</li><li>You’ll get the biggest bang for your buck spending time with the people who are doing the best work, but you still need to figure out how to manage everybody else. (Location 3145)</li><li>all people have their own growth trajectories, and it’s a mistake to push everyone to be either a “superstar” or a “rock star.” You need to balance growth and stability. (Location 3149)</li><li>it’s important to have career conversations in which you get to know each of your direct reports better, learn what their aspirations are, and plan how to help them achieve those dreams. (Location 3150)</li><li>He knew his first step was to show them that the company cared about them. But of course it’s bosses who give a damn— companies can’t care personally any more than governments or any other institution can. (Location 3162)</li><li>“You need a long-term vision and an eighteen-month plan,” she advised. (Location 3168)</li><li>By the end of the conversation, he understood much better what motivated Sarah at work. He then wrote down each of her motivators (e.g., “financial independence,” “environmentalism,” “hard work,” “leadership”) and explained how the stories she’d told him about her life had led him to choose these words. This was an important check for understanding. (Location 3187)</li><li>he’d ask people about their past before moving on to their future. (Location 3192)</li><li>he asked Sarah what skills she thought were most important to achieve each dream. Finally, he asked Sarah what skills she felt she had the most competence in. (Location 3194)</li><li>While making the plan, it also became evident that Sarah could get the management experience faster by staying at Google than by leaving. (Location 3202)</li><li>The work she was doing, which had seemed so separate from what she really wanted out of life, now made a lot more sense to her. (Location 3204)</li><li>for having career conversations, Russ held an off-site and taught his managers how to talk to their direct reports not just about their career goals or how to get promoted but also about their life stories and dreams. He taught every manager on his team to have a succession of three forty-five-minute conversations with each direct report over the course of three to six weeks. (Location 3206)</li><li>Conversation one: life story (Location 3211)</li><li>The first conversation is designed to learn what motivates each person who reports directly to you. Russ suggested a simple opening to these conversations. “Starting with kindergarten, tell me about your life.” (Location 3211)</li><li>he advised each manager to focus on changes that people had made and to understand why they’d made those choices. (Location 3213)</li><li>“You dropped out of graduate school after two years to work on Wall Street— please tell me more about that decision.” (Location 3214)</li><li>you’re not looking for definitive answers; you’re just trying to get to know people a little better and understand what they care about. (Location 3221)</li><li>It seemed like a boundary violation to ask people about their lives outside of work. Russ explained two things. One, most people are happy to have this conversation, as long as it takes place in an environment of trust and respect. (Location 3222)</li><li>there may be times when you touch on something that is too personal. If a person signals discomfort at a question, you have to respect that. (Location 3225)</li><li>When you understand what motivates a person and why, you’re much better able to understand their dreams. (Location 3243)</li><li>The second conversation: dreams (Location 3245)</li><li>The second conversation moves from understanding what motivates people to understanding the person’s dreams— what they want to achieve at the apex of their career, how they imagine life at its best to feel. (Location 3245)</li><li>Giving space for people to talk about dreams allows bosses to help people find opportunities that can move them in the direction of those dreams. This makes work more satisfying and more meaningful and ultimately improves retention. (Location 3257)</li><li>“What do you want the pinnacle of your career to look like?” (Location 3261)</li><li>Russ suggests encouraging people to come up with three to five different dreams for the future. This allows employees to include the dream they think you want to hear as well as those that are far closer to their hearts. (Location 3262)</li><li>Ask each direct report to create a document with three to five columns; title each with the names of the dreams they described in the last conversation. Then, list the skills needed as rows. Show how important each skill is to each dream, and what their level of competency is in that skill. Generally, it will become very obvious what new skills the person needs to acquire. Now, your job as the boss is to help them think about how they can acquire those skills: what are the projects you can put them on, whom can you introduce them to, what are the options for education? (Location 3264)</li><li>The final part of Russ’s second conversation involves making sure that the person’s dreams are aligned with the values they have expressed. (Location 3268)</li><li>For example, “If ‘hard work’ is a core value, why is one of your dreams to retire early?” Inquiring about the dreams people describe is an important way to push for candid, meaningful conversations. (Location 3269)</li><li>Conversation three: eighteen-month plan (Location 3277)</li><li>Russ taught managers to get people to begin asking themselves the following questions: “What do I need to learn in order to move in the direction of my dreams? How should I prioritize the things I need to learn? Whom can I learn from?” How can I change my role to learn it? (Location 3277)</li><li>Once people were clear on what they wanted to learn next, it was much easier for managers to identify opportunities at work that would help them develop skills in the next six to eighteen months that would take them in the direction of at least one of their dreams. (Location 3279)</li><li>make a list of how the person’s role can change to help them learn the skills needed to achieve each dream; whom they can learn from; and classes they could take or books they could read. Then, next to each item, note who does what by when— and make sure you have some action items. (Location 3282)</li><li>Thoreau said it best in Walden: “If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary &mldr; If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.” (Location 3286)</li><li>It’s scary to move confidently in the direction of one’s dreams. Part of your responsibility as the boss is to help people find the courage to do just that. If you do it well, there are few more rewarding jobs. (Location 3290)</li><li>GROWTH MANAGEMENT Figure out who needs what types of opportunities, and how you’re going to provide them (Location 3298)</li><li>Once a year, you need to put together a growth-management plan for each person on your team. Take a look across your whole team and make sure that you understand how each individual’s aspirations and growth trajectory is lining up with the collective needs of the team. Then, unless everyone on your team is both where they want and where they need to be, you’re going to have to have some pretty challenging conversations. (Location 3303)</li><li>The first step is to identify your rock stars and superstars. Write their names in the correct boxes. Next, identify the people on your team who are doing good, but not exceptional, work. This will probably be the majority of people. Then, identify the people who are performing poorly but whom you believe should do much better, either because they are demonstrating signs that they can improve or because their skills and ambitions suggest improvement is possible. Finally— and this is usually the hardest part— identify the people who are not doing good work and not getting any better. (Location 3307)</li><li>Then, (Location 3312)</li><li>Find someone who is familiar with the work of the people on your team but not as emotionally attached as you are— your boss, a peer, an HR person. If they would put your people in different boxes, make sure you understand why, even if you disagree. Especially if you disagree. (Location 3313)</li><li>come up with a three- to five-bullet-point growth plan for each person. Make sure that you have projects or opportunities that will stretch the superstars. Make sure that you’re giving the rock stars what they need to be productive. (Location 3316)</li><li>Think of ways to push people who are doing good work to do exceptional work. What kind of new projects or education or help can you offer them? For the people who are doing bad work but show signs of improving: have you put these people in the wrong roles? Are expectations clear? Do they need additional training? (Location 3318)</li><li>And that brings us to the people who are doing bad work and not getting any better. At some point, you have to initiate the process of firing these people— most bosses understandably wait too long for this. If you’re at a big company, you’ll probably need to talk to HR about a formal Performance Improvement Plan. (Location 3320)</li><li>If you are regularly thinking about personal growth, as you should be, you shouldn’t need to spend more than five to fifteen minutes per direct report jotting down growth plans. This should feel more like a disciplined sanity check than an arduous process. It’s a way to make sure you have the whole team’s growth trajectory in your head. (Location 3325)</li><li>If a lot of your peers are also doing growth-management plans, it’s a good idea to compare notes. When you’re part of a broader team, it’s important to have a shared understanding of what exceptional work is, what good work is, and what bad work is. (Location 3329)</li><li>These are hard conversations, but worthwhile because they encourage more consistency among managers. Making sure that all managers are treating the different types of high performers similarly is important to making sure everyone feels the system is fair. It will also give your team the opportunity to be explicit about what they feel the right ratio of people on a steep versus gradual growth trajectory ought to be. (Location 3335)</li><li>Because you care so much about your direct reports, you tend to see the best in them. This is a good thing, but it can turn into a form of unconscious bias on a really big team. (Location 3339)</li><li>If you’re the leader of a team of five hundred people, you’ll naturally tend to think most highly of your direct reports. And these direct reports think most highly of their direct reports. So if you’re not careful, a disproportionate percentage of the people considered rock stars or superstars will be the most senior people in a hierarchy, even though that kind of grade inflation may not reflect reality. (Location 3340)</li><li>Too often, the people who have the most senior roles are given the highest ratings when in fact they are surfing on the productivity of the people working for them. (Location 3344)</li><li>one would expect there to be the same distribution of excellent performance throughout, as well as a higher ratio of more senior people on a gradual growth trajectory and a higher ratio of more junior people on a steep growth trajectory. (Location 3345)</li><li>In practice, most management teams respond in the reverse manner— a greater percentage of senior rather than junior people get put in the superstar box. If this happens, ask some hard questions and make sure there’s an identifiable, justifiable reason for it. (Location 3347)</li><li>All hiring is flawed and subjective, and these drawbacks cannot be fixed; they can only be managed. (Location 3356)</li><li>Job description: define team “fit” as rigorously as you define “skills” to minimize bias. (Location 3359)</li><li>The hiring person— not a recruiter!— should write the job description, basing it on the role, the skills required for the role, and the team “fit” criteria. Defining team fit can be hard, which makes it tempting to leave out. Try to describe your culture in three to four words. It could be “detail-oriented,” “quirky,” and “blunt.” Or maybe it’s “big picture,” “straightlaced,” and “polite.” (Location 3360)</li><li>if you take the time to define the growth trajectory required for the role, it can help the interviewers avoid one kind of hiring bias: hiring people who share your ambitions, which may not be desirable for the role. (Location 3364)</li><li>Interviewing takes time, filling out interview feedback reports takes time, and so it’s important to be very selective about who gets invited to interview. (Location 3367)</li><li>An example of a good prescreen is a skills assessment: ask potential candidates to do a project or solve a problem related to the job they’re applying for. This will weed out a number of candidates who look good on paper but can’t actually do the work. It will also give candidates who’d be great at the job but look bad on paper the opportunity to interview. (Location 3369)</li><li>Use the same interview committee for multiple candidates, to allow for meaningful comparisons. (Location 3378)</li><li>don’t make unilateral hiring decisions. Because interviewing is so subjective and prone to bias, you’ll improve your odds of making good decisions by getting multiple perspectives. However, this means you need to be consistent and thoughtful about who interviews with whom. (Location 3379)</li><li>Four people is about the right size for an interview committee. Ideally, the interviewing committee is diverse. (Location 3382)</li><li>It’s also helpful if at least one of the interviewers is on another team. This prevents “desperation hiring.” When there’s a “hole” on a team, people become so eager to fill the position that they ignore warning signals. Somebody who isn’t feeling the pain of the hole on the team as acutely is more likely to point out these danger signs. (Location 3384)</li><li>Casual interviews reveal more about team fit than formal ones. (Location 3387)</li><li>interviewing is a learning-by-doing skill. (Location 3388)</li><li>Another good practice is to have people intentionally create more casual moments— take candidates to lunch, walk them to the car. Ask the receptionist and schedulers if they had any reaction to the candidate. In unguarded moments, candidates will do or say revealing things. An important part of my team’s culture was Bob Sutton’s “No Assholes” rule. (Location 3390)</li><li>Write down your interview feedback; doing that is as clarifying for you as it is for the rest of the committee, and it will result in better hiring decisions. Write down your thoughts on each of the skills, if you’re interviewing for skills, as well as for each of the team fit criteria identified. (Location 3397)</li><li>schedule an hour, interview for forty-five minutes, and write for fifteen. This arrangement will force you to have a more focused interview and to make a better recommendation about whom to hire. (Location 3405)</li><li>In-person debrief/ decision: if you’re not dying to hire the person, don’t make an offer. (Location 3407)</li><li>The best advice I ever got for hiring somebody is this: if you’re not dying to hire somebody, don’t make an offer. And, even if you are dying to hire somebody, allow yourself to be overruled by the other interviewers who feel strongly the person should not be hired. In general, a bias toward no is useful when hiring. (Location 3408)</li><li>Once three to four candidates have been interviewed for a role, the hiring committee should meet to discuss each one. These in-person conversations take real discipline to schedule, but if you believe that it makes sense to have multiple people interview each candidate, then talking about your assessments face to face is the fastest and soundest way to make a good decision. (Location 3410)</li><li>Making all feedback visible to all interviewers after they’ve submitted theirs will help these hiring-committee meetings go more quickly, but it will require more prep from each person. (Location 3413)</li><li>A good way to ensure that everyone is on the same page is to schedule a one-hour meeting with a fifteen-minute “study hall” time at the beginning so everyone can read everyone else’s feedback. (Location 3414)</li><li>SOME COMPANIES DON’T invest much time in the hiring process, on the theory that it’s easy to fire people. This is a big mistake. Firing people is not easy, either emotionally or legally. (Location 3419)</li><li>Firing people is hard, and it ought to be hard. But if you do three things, you can make it far, far easier on the person you are firing— as well as on yourself and your team. (Location 3428)</li><li>Virtually all managers I’ve ever worked with have been far too slow to admit when somebody on their team is starting to underperform. They don’t admit it to themselves, let alone to their bosses or to HR. (Location 3431)</li><li>There are four very good reasons to push yourself to identify underperformance early. One, to be fair to the person who’s failing. If you identify a problem early, you give the person time to address it. You also reduce the shock if they can’t or won’t address it and you wind up having to fire the person. Two, to be fair to your company. If you identify and address problems early enough, you dramatically reduce the risk of getting sued or the chance that you’ll have to keep them on the payroll for months of painful legal documentation. Three, to be fair to yourself. When you give somebody a good rating one quarter and fire them the next, word gets around, and it undermines trust with everyone else. Not to mention that you risk being sued by the fired employee. Although it is time-consuming and unpleasant to address performance problems, it takes a lot more time and is far more unpleasant to deal with a lawsuit. Four, and most importantly, you want to address underperformance early to be fair to the people who are performing really well. (Location 3437)</li><li>Once you’ve identified performance issues, take the time to get advice from your boss, to calibrate with your peers (if appropriate), and to get help from HR. Don’t take the attitude that this is your decision alone. (Location 3446)</li><li>Many people get lost in their own heads around this highly charged issue; your boss and your peers can help you think more clearly. Good HR people can not only help you think more clearly but also make sure you do it in a way that won’t get you or the company sued. (Location 3448)</li><li>I’ve seen dozens of cases where a manager has been advised how to write a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). They are told to make it fair but not too easy, to make sure that it really addresses the performance issue. The managers hear the “fair” part but ignore the “not too easy” part. The person passes the PIP without addressing the core issue, and the performance problem drags on for another three or six months. (Location 3452)</li><li>You have a relationship with the person you’re about to fire. You still give a damn about this person. Think hard about how to do it in a way that will make it easiest on them— even if it makes it harder on you, or if you have to take some risks. (Location 3459)</li><li>When you have to fire people, do it with humility. Remember, the reason you have to fire them is not that they suck. It’s not even that they suck at this job. It’s that this job— the job you gave them— sucks for them. (Location 3467)</li><li>usually email people about a month after I’ve fired them to check in. I try to keep my ear to the ground about jobs they might be well-suited for. But even if I don’t have anything to offer, I will reach out. (Location 3469)</li><li>when a few managers get together to make sure their promotions are fair, the politics can get ugly very quickly. Disagreements can become overly personalized, silent disagreement can become toxic, and bizarre backroom bartering occurs—“ I’ll support your undeserving person if you’ll support mine.” (Location 3478)</li><li>promotion committees, which were assembled off-site for one day twice a year. They debated the promotions of other people’s direct reports, not their own, based on a packet of relatively objective information about each person’s accomplishments. (Location 3482)</li><li>Google’s system is perfect. It tends to reward people who do the most visible projects rather than those who make important breakthroughs behind the scenes. And recommendations from some people go further than they ought to. (Location 3487)</li><li>Prepare. Ask everyone on your team to send in a list of people they are planning to promote, together with a justification. If you have an HR partner, ask that person to organize all names and justifications by level and pull together a presentation that makes the information easy to grasp and absorb. (Location 3493)</li><li>Get enough sleep the day before, exercise that morning, and eat a good breakfast. You are going to need to be calm and, if possible, funny that day. (Location 3500)</li><li>If neither your company nor your boss seem concerned with making sure that promotions are fair, you can always propose to your peers that you get together and calibrate. If they won’t, you can still look at the people you’re planning to promote, look at other people who are at the company, and do a sanity check. (Location 3504)</li><li>Announcing promotions breeds unhealthy competition for the wrong things: documentation of status rather than development of skill. (Location 3511)</li><li>But when there are big public celebrations of promotions, the costs in terms of the organization’s focus on hierarchy often outweigh the benefits of publicly recognizing those being promoted. (Location 3514)</li><li>What about public praise? Yes, by all means, praise in public. But think carefully about what you are praising. Praise the things you want more of: high-quality work, mind-boggling innovation, amazing efficiency, selfless teamwork, and so on. Do you really want such a focus on promotions? If not, then don’t make such a big deal of them. (Location 3519)</li><li>The importance of the simplest things, like thank-yous, are most often forgotten by bosses— even good bosses. A thank-you goes beyond praise. Praise expresses admiration for great work. A thank-you expresses personal gratitude. In the case of a thank-you, you are explaining not just why the work matters, but why it matters to you. (Location 3524)</li><li>Another great way to highlight how great people are at a job is to acknowledge them as gurus in their area of expertise. You might acknowledge their mastery by putting the person in charge of teaching others the skill. (Location 3529)</li><li>one of the most common complaints from people who do excellent work and are on a gradual growth trajectory is that they feel invisible. (Location 3534)</li><li>THERE ARE FEW pleasures greater than being part of a team where everyone loves their job and loves working together. You can build a team like that if you have career conversations with each of the people on your team, create growth-management plans for each person who works for you once a year, hire the right people, fire the appropriate people, promote the right people, and reward the people who are doing great work but who shouldn’t be promoted, and offer yourself as a partner to your direct reports. It’s absolutely within your power to build a team that looks forward to coming to work every day. Together you will accomplish things that you could never do individually, while each of you individually takes a step in the direction of your dreams. (Location 3570)</li><li>Your role will to be to encourage that process of listening, clarifying, debating, deciding, persuading, and executing to the point that it’s almost as if your team shares one mind when it comes to completing projects, and then learning from their results. (Location 3586)</li><li>“Don’t start by bossing people. They’ll just hate you. Start by listening to them.” (Location 3589)</li><li>One of your most important responsibilities to keep everything moving smoothly is to decide who needs to communicate with whom and how frequently. (Location 3590)</li><li>The purpose of a 1: 1 meeting is to listen and clarify— to understand what direction each person working for you wants to head in, and what is blocking them. (Location 3607)</li><li>found that when I quit thinking of them as meetings and began treating them as if I were having lunch or coffee with somebody I was eager to get to know better, they ended up yielding much better conversations. (Location 3618)</li><li>1: 1s should be a natural bottleneck that determines how many direct reports a boss can have. I like to meet with each person who works directly for me for fifty minutes a week. But I can’t bear more than about five hours of 1: 1 time in my calendar. Listening is hard work, and I don’t have an endless capacity for it every day.

(Location 3641)</li><li>When your direct reports own and set the agenda for their 1: 1s, they’re more productive, because they allow you to listen to what matters to them. (Location 3643)</li><li>Whether you want a structured agenda or you prefer a more free-flowing meeting, the agenda itself should be directed by your direct report, not you. (Location 3647)</li><li>Encourage new ideas in the 1: 1. It’s worth keeping Jony Ive’s quote, “new ideas are fragile,” top of mind before a 1: 1. This meeting should be a safe place for people to nurture new ideas before they are submitted to the rough-and-tumble of debate. (Location 3671)</li><li>Here are some questions that you can use to nurture new ideas by pushing people to be clearer: “What do you need to develop that idea further so that it’s ready to discuss with the broader team? How can I help?” “I think you’re on to something, but it’s still not clear to me. Can you try explaining it again?” “Let’s wrestle some more with it, OK?” “I understand what you mean, but I don’t think others will. How can you explain it so it will be easier for them to understand?” (Location 3675)</li><li>1s are valuable meetings for your direct reports to share their thinking with you and to decide what direction to proceed with their work. (Location 3686)</li><li>If they never criticize you, you’re not good enough at getting guidance from your team. (Location 3695)</li><li>No agenda. If they consistently come with no topics to discuss, it might mean that they are overwhelmed, that they don’t understand the purpose of the meeting, or that they don’t consider it useful. Be direct but polite: “This is your time, but you don’t seem to come with much to talk about. Can you tell me why?” (Location 3697)</li><li>Although bloated staff meetings can be a drain on people’s time and energy, the opposite is also true; a well-run meeting can save you time by alerting you to problems, sharing updates efficiently, and getting you all on the same page about what the week’s shared priorities are. (Location 3704)</li><li>An effective staff meeting has three goals: it reviews how things have gone the previous week, allows people to share important updates, and forces the team to clarify the most important decisions and debates for the coming week. That’s it. It shouldn’t be the place to have debates or make decisions. (Location 3706)</li><li>agenda that I’ve found to be most effective: ■ Learn: review key metrics (twenty minutes) ■ Listen: put updates in a shared document (fifteen minutes) ■ Clarify: identify key decisions & debates (thirty minutes) (Location 3710)</li><li>put updates in a shared document during a “study hall” (15 minutes). One of the most challenging aspects of managing a team is how to keep everyone abreast of what everyone else is doing so that they can flag areas of concern or overlap without wasting a great deal of time. (Location 3721)</li><li>“We need to change our goals for this project,” “I am thinking of doing a re-org,” “I’m starting to think I need to fire so-and-so,” or “I have to have surgery next month and will be out for three weeks.” (Location 3724)</li><li>Almost everybody hates long meetings, so some go the other direction and set up a public document where everyone jots down the key things they did last week and what they plan to do next week. Google did this and called these updates “snippets.” (Location 3726)</li><li>is easy to use and avoids interminable staff meetings; after all, it just takes a few minutes to write your own snippets and a few minutes more to read everyone else’s. (Location 3728)</li><li>I found that although I was all for avoiding an endless staff meeting, I was also one of those people who find it disproportionately burdensome to take the five minutes to input my snippets. For a while, I forced myself to do it anyway, but when I realized I wasn’t alone, I decided to find a different solution. (Location 3730)</li><li>Have everybody take five to seven minutes to write down the three to five things that they or their team did that week that others need to know about, and five to seven minutes to read everybody else’s updates. Don’t allow side conversations— require that follow-up questions be handled after the meeting. This simple rule will save enormous amounts of wasted time in your staff meeting. (Location 3734)</li><li>What are the one or two most important decisions and the single most important debate your team needs to take on that week? If your team is fewer than twenty or so people, you can probably just list them and decide/ debate in an ad hoc way. (Location 3744)</li><li>YOU’VE JUST READ about adding 1: 1 meetings and a staff meeting to your calendar. You’ll probably have to attend some “big debate” and “big decision” meetings. (Location 3755)</li><li>My advice is that you schedule in some think time, and hold that think time sacred. Let people know that they cannot ever schedule over it. (Location 3767)</li><li>“BIG DEBATE” MEETINGS are reserved for debate, but not decisions, on major issues facing the team. They serve three purposes: (Location 3771)</li><li>At least part of the friction and frustration in a lot of meetings results from the fact that half the room thinks they are there to make a decision, the other half to debate. The would-be deciders are furious that the debaters don’t seem to be driving toward an answer. (Location 3772)</li><li>To avoid this, teams sometimes rush into a decision before they have really thought it through or gotten sufficient input. Putting a topic like that on the debate agenda forces a team to keep wrestling with it, digging up needed information, getting expert input, or just thinking more deeply. (Location 3778)</li><li>Debate should occur constantly on a well-functioning team. (Location 3781)</li><li>Having regular debates— arguments, even— also lowers tension because it prevents explosive fights. The principle of “self-organizing criticality”— a lot of little corrections create stability but one huge correction creates catastrophe— applies to human relationships as much as it does to markets. (Location 3784)</li><li>Make it clear that everyone must check egos at the door of this meeting. The goal of debate is to work together to come up with the best answer. There should be no “winners” or “losers.” A good norm is to ask participants to switch roles halfway through each debate. This makes sure that people are listening to each other, and helps them keep focused on coming up with the best answer and letting go of egos/ positions. The sole product of the debate should be a careful summary of the facts and issues that emerged, a clearer definition of the choices going forward, and a recommendation to keep debating or to move on to a decision. (Location 3792)</li><li>“BIG DECISION” MEETINGS typically but not always follow a big debate meeting. They serve two important roles. The first is obvious: to make important decisions. The second, though, is subtler. It can be hard to figure out when to stop debating and start deciding. (Location 3798)</li><li>The product of “big decision” meetings is a careful summary of the meeting distributed to all relevant parties. It’s important that the decisions are final, otherwise they’ll always be appealed and will really be debates, not decisions. (Location 3806)</li><li>It’s shocking how fast the decisions that some people make start to seem mysterious or even nefarious to people who weren’t close to the process. If your team is one hundred or more people, a regular all-hands meeting can really help to get broad buy-in on the decisions being made— and also to learn about dissent. (Location 3815)</li><li>presentations to persuade people that the company is making good decisions and headed in the right direction, and Q& As conducted so leaders can hear dissent and address it head-on. (Location 3819)</li><li>When handled well, the answers the leaders give to the questions, which are often quite challenging, are usually more persuasive than the presentations. (Location 3821)</li><li>The presentations typically focus on one or two initiatives that are especially exciting and important. They are meant to inform everyone of broader priorities, and to get their buy-in. The presentations are generally done by the team working on the initiative. This practice at Google was important; it built the “persuade” muscle throughout the company. (Location 3826)</li><li>Q& A is usually handled by the CEO/ founders and allows them to learn what people really think, and so it generally falls to them to answer these often unpleasant, challenging, or awkward questions. The way that these questions get answered is enormously important to persuading a lot of people at once that the right decisions are being made the right way. (Location 3830)</li><li>Being ruthless about making sure your team has time to execute is one of the most important things you can do as a boss. (Location 3841)</li><li>blocked off think-time in calendar; I also found it necessary to block off time in my calendar to be alone and execute. (Location 3849)</li><li>To Do, In Progress, and Done. You can quickly see who’s the bottleneck. It’s a great way to drive personal accountability but also for everyone on a team to see who needs help and to give it to them. (Location 3856)</li><li>When it’s clear to everyone where the bottlenecks are, resources flow to the places where they are most needed, without intervention from management. (Location 3860)</li><li>measuring activities and visualizing workflows is important is that when a business is doing really well, it’s hard to tell from the results who’s along for the ride and who’s actually making things happen. Similarly, when the economy is tanking due to factors beyond anyone’s control, if you just measure results it’s hard to know who’s doing a great job bailing out your boat and who’s simply panicking or making the situation worse. (Location 3863)</li><li>Measuring activities will also create more respect between teams. It’s always surprising how quick one team is to assume that another team sits around doing nothing, and how much resentment builds up over this. When you can see from a Kanban board what people are doing, respect tends to flow pretty naturally. (Location 3876)</li><li>LISTENING TO THE people who report directly to you is relatively straightforward, even if it requires time and discipline. But if you are a manager of managers, listening “deep” in your organization is much harder. You can’t listen to everybody. You can’t have 1: 1s with hundreds or thousands of people. (Location 3886)</li><li>Notice the things you don’t notice when you’re buried in work at your desk or racing, head down, from one meeting to the next. Ask people who catch your attention— ideally, people you haven’t talked to in a while— what they’re working on. Find some small problems and treat them like “the universe through a grain of sand.” Awareness of these small problems can be useful in several ways. (Location 3894)</li><li>Too often a boss is the last to know when something is going wrong. The reason is generally not because people are intentionally hiding problems, but because they only want to bring the important things to your attention. But a problem may be more important than they realize. (Location 3898)</li><li>being aware of small problems and maybe even rolling up your sleeves and fixing them yourself is the best way to kill the “it’s not my job” or, worse, the “that’s beneath me” mentality on your team. (Location 3900)</li><li>when you show that you care about the small things that contribute to customer happiness or the quality of life on your team, suddenly everybody cares more about them, and some of the big things start working better, too. (Location 3902)</li><li>create a culture at Twitter in which people would fix small processes and annoyances rather than just complaining about them. (Location 3904)</li><li>“CULTURE EATS STRATEGY for lunch.” 1 A team’s culture has an enormous impact on its results, and a leader’s personality has a huge impact on a team’s culture. Who you are as a human being impacts your team’s culture enormously. (Location 3911)</li><li>worried the company’s culture reflected his own personality too much. (Location 3915)</li><li>The culture of the team often reflected me, but not always in the way I would have chosen. (Location 3917)</li><li>People are listening. Like it or not, you’re under the microscope (Location 3925)</li><li>When you become the boss, you are under the microscope. People do listen to you in an intense way you never experienced before (Location 3926)</li><li>becoming a boss is like getting arrested. Everything you say or do can and will be used against you. (Location 3927)</li><li>Given the level of scrutiny you’re under as the boss, it’s important to clarify what you’re saying— even when you think you’re not saying anything. (Location 3943)</li><li>“ask for forgiveness not permission” culture in which people felt free to challenge the rules, this worked. (Location 3947)</li><li>Don’t let things that pervert your culture “just happen” (Location 3950)</li><li>When you pay attention to seemingly small details, it can have a big impact on persuading people that your culture is worth understanding and adapting to. (Location 3963)</li><li>It’s surprising how a small action from you can impact your team’s culture, even after you’re no longer around. (Location 3971)</li><li>Shit happens. When you’re the boss and shit happens, it’s your responsibility to learn from it and make a change. If you don’t, you create a culture that doesn’t learn from its mistakes. (Location 3980)</li><li>The most amazing thing about a culture is that once it’s strong, it’s self-replicating. Even though you’ve taken a number of conscious actions to impact it, you’ll know you’ve succeeded when it truly is no longer about you.
