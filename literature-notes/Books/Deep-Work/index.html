What are the reasons that make knowledge workers lose their familiarity with it? What is the consequence of spending too much time on shallow work?</p><p>Deep work is a professional activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that pushes cognitive capabilities to their limit. It creates new value, improves skills, and is hard to replicate. Knowledge workers are losing their familiarity with deep work due to network tools. These tools, combined with easy access to them through smartphones and networked office computers, have fragmented most knowledge workers&rsquo; attention. This state of fragmented attention cannot accommodate deep work, which requires long periods of uninterrupted thinking. Spending enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness can permanently reduce one&rsquo;s capacity to perform deep work.</p><p>Indeed, the concept of deep work and its relationship to satisfaction and meaning in one&rsquo;s work and life is a recurring theme in the book. The idea that cultivating focus and immersion in challenging tasks can lead to a state of flow and deep satisfaction is supported by the research of Fredrickson and Csikszentmihalyi, among others.</p><p>Moreover, there is a connection between craftsmanship and this sense of sacredness and meaning in one&rsquo;s work. The idea that any pursuit that supports high levels of skill can generate a sense of sacredness is a powerful one, and it reminds us that the specifics of the job we choose are not necessarily what matter most for our career satisfaction.</p><p>In short, a deep life, one in which we engage in meaningful and challenging work that requires our full attention and skill, is a good life, regardless of the specifics of the work itself.</p><p>The author describes four different philosophies for incorporating deep work into one&rsquo;s life: the monastic philosophy, the bimodal philosophy, the rhythmic philosophy, and the journalistic philosophy. Each approach has different ways of scheduling time for deep work and achieving a state of unbroken concentration. Additionally, the author suggests creating rituals to support deep work sessions, including specific locations, time frames, and rules for working. Finally, the author emphasizes the importance of minimizing decision-making during deep work sessions to conserve willpower.</p><p>The first discipline of the Four Disciplines of Execution is to focus on the wildly important, which means identifying a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours. The second discipline is to act on lead measures, which measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures. For an individual focused on deep work, the relevant lead measure would be time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward their wildly important goal. The third discipline is to keep a compelling scoreboard to create a sense of competition and drive focus on lead measures. The fourth discipline is to create a cadence of accountability with regular and frequent meetings where team members confront their scoreboard, commit to specific actions, and describe what happened with their commitments from the last meeting.</p><p>The 4DX framework focuses on execution over strategizing and isolates a few basic disciplines that work well. Idleness is necessary for the brain like vitamin D is for the body, and it is required for deep work. To get deep work done, individuals should regularly include idleness into their day. It is important to shut down work thinking completely at the end of the workday to allow the unconscious mind to sort through the most complex professional challenges. Attention restoration theory (ART) suggests that spending time in nature can improve concentration, and individuals should avoid interrupting their evening with work-related tasks to restore their directed attention centers.</p><p>Deliberate practice is the activity required to get better at something, and it overlaps substantially with deep work. To succeed with deep work, individuals should hit their daily deep work capacity during their workday and implement a strict shutdown ritual at the end of the day. Regularly resting the brain improves the quality of deep work, and the ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained. Finally, individuals must wean their minds from a dependence on distraction to deepen their focus.</p><p>In summary, to succeed in deep work and increase concentration, one should schedule time for distraction-free work, practice resistance to distractions, and use artificial deadlines to increase productivity. Additionally, productive meditation can help focus on a specific professional problem during physical activities, but one should be aware of the mind&rsquo;s tendency to loop over known information and distract from the task at hand.</p><p>In order to structure your deep thinking process, start by identifying the relevant variables and defining the specific next-step question. Once the next-step question is identified, focus your attention on solving it and consolidate your gains by reviewing the answer.</p><p>There are two approaches to selecting network tools: the Any-Benefit Approach and the Craftsman Approach. The Craftsman Approach requires that the positive impacts of a tool outweigh the negative impacts on factors that are important to you.</p><p>The Law of the Vital Few states that in many cases, 80% of an effect is due to just 20% of the possible causes.</p><p>A strategy for limiting social media and to improve your leisure time, dedicate some advance thinking to how you want to spend it and plan out what you will do with your evenings and weekends in advance. Another strategy involves banning yourself from using all social media services for thirty days and then asking whether the last thirty days would have been better if you had used them and whether people cared that you weren&rsquo;t using them.</p><p>The typical person needs to learn that their mental faculties do not tire like an arm or a leg, but rather want change, not rest, except during sleep. Working a few good hours in a typical workday is lucky due to interruptions, meetings, web surfing, and personal business.
Fewer official working hours can help people spend their time more wisely. 37signals gave employees the entire month of June off for deep work, resulting in new ideas. Shallow work can be dangerous if it begins to crowd out deep efforts. Scheduling every minute of the day can increase productivity and ensure significant blocks of time for deep work or brainstorming. If an important insight arises, it&rsquo;s okay to abandon the schedule for the day. With structure, innovation is more likely to occur, and being willing to abandon the plan allows for creative follow-up.</p><p>This text provides several strategies to prioritize deep work over shallow work, which can be detrimental to productivity. One of the strategies is to quantify the depth of every activity and bias time towards the deeper ones. Another suggestion is to ask your boss for a shallow work budget, which is the amount of time allowed for shallow tasks. The text also suggests implementing a fixed-schedule productivity strategy, where you set a goal to finish work by a certain time and work backwards to find productivity strategies to achieve that goal. Additionally, the author recommends being cautious with saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to shallow work obligations and being clear in refusal but ambiguous in explanation. These strategies can help individuals focus on deep work and increase productivity.</p><p>In this section, the author discusses the problem of being constantly accessible through email and offers tips for becoming harder to reach. One strategy is to make people who email you do more work by setting up a sender filter, which requires them to answer specific questions or meet certain criteria before you&rsquo;ll respond. The author also suggests adopting a process-centric approach to email, which involves taking time to think through the project represented by a message and identifying the most efficient process for bringing it to a successful conclusion. Additionally, the author notes that many successful academics have a default behavior of not responding to emails unless the sender makes a convincing case and minimizes the effort required to respond. Ultimately, the author argues that a commitment to deep work requires letting go of the artificial busyness of rapid email messaging and social media posturing.</p><a href=#highlights><h2 id=highlights><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Highlights</h2></a><ul><li>Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.

This task requires deep work. If you don’t cultivate this ability, you’re likely to fall behind as technology advances. (Location 148)</li><li>To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you’re capable of producing— a task that requires depth. (Location 154)</li><li>The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive. (Location 166)</li><li>I build my days around a core of carefully chosen deep work, with the shallow activities I absolutely cannot avoid batched into smaller bursts (Location 188)</li><li>Tyler Cowen summarizes this reality more bluntly: “The key question will be: are you good at working with intelligent machines or not?” (Location 252)</li><li>Once the talent market is made universally accessible, those at the peak of the market thrive while the rest suffer. (Location 264)</li><li>As digital technology reduces the need for labor in many industries, the proportion of the rewards returned to those who own the intelligent machines is growing. (Location 285)</li><li>In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital. (Location 293)</li><li>I just identified two groups that are poised to thrive and that I claim are accessible: those who can work creatively with intelligent machines and those who are stars in their field. (Location 302)</li><li>Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy 1. The ability to quickly master hard things. 2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed. (Location 305)</li><li>The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work. If you haven’t mastered this foundational skill, you’ll struggle to learn hard things or produce at an elite level. (Location 343)</li><li>we argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.” (Location 363)</li><li>deliberate practice actually requires. Its core components are usually identified as follows: (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive. (Location 371)</li><li>science of performance argues that you get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around the relevant neurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and effectively. To be great at something is to be well myelinated. (Location 381)</li><li>The reason, therefore, why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination. (Location 386)</li><li>If you’re comfortable going deep, you’ll be comfortable mastering the increasingly complex systems and skills needed to thrive in our economy. (Location 393)</li><li>High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus) (Location 426)</li><li>when you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn’t immediately follow— a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task. (Location 442)</li><li>By working on a single hard task for a long time without switching, Grant minimizes the negative impact of attention residue from his other obligations, allowing him to maximize performance on this one task. (Location 452)</li><li>the common habit of working in a state of semi-distraction is potentially devastating to your performance. (Location 456)</li><li>To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. (Location 462)</li><li>other ideas are being prioritized as more important than deep work in the business world, including, as we just encountered, serendipitous collaboration, rapid communication, and an active presence on social media. It’s bad enough that so many trends are prioritized ahead of deep work, but to add insult to injury, many of these trends actively decrease one’s ability to go deep.

(Location 1092)</li><li>the monastic philosophy of deep work scheduling. This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations. (Location 1105)</li><li>the bimodal philosophy of deep work. This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically— seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. This division of time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales. (Location 1151)</li><li>The bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can produce extreme productivity, but only if the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavors to reach maximum cognitive intensity— the state in which real breakthroughs occur. This is why the minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day. To put aside a few hours in the morning, for example, is too short to count as a deep work stretch for an adherent of this approach. (Location 1156)</li><li>the rhythmic philosophy. This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit. The goal, in other words, is to generate a rhythm for this work that removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you’re going to go deep. The chain method is a good example of the rhythmic philosophy of deep work scheduling because it combines a simple scheduling heuristic (do the work every day), with an easy way to remind yourself to do the work: the big red Xs on the calendar. (Location 1188)</li><li>Another common way to implement the rhythmic philosophy is to replace the visual aid of the chain method with a set starting time that you use every day for deep work. In much the same way that maintaining visual indicators of your work progress can reduce the barrier to entry for going deep, eliminating even the simplest scheduling decisions, such as when during the day to do the work, also reduces this barrier. (Location 1192)</li><li>The rhythmic philosophy provides an interesting contrast to the bimodal philosophy. It perhaps fails to achieve the most intense levels of deep thinking sought in the daylong concentration sessions favored by the bimodalist. The trade-off, however, is that this approach works better with the reality of human nature. By supporting deep work with rock-solid routines that make sure a little bit gets done on a regular basis, the rhythmic scheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours per year. (Location 1210)</li><li>I call this approach, in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule, the journalist philosophy.

(Location 1240)</li><li>This approach is not for the deep work novice. As I established in the opening to this rule, the ability to rapidly switch your mind from shallow to deep mode doesn’t come naturally. Without practice, such switches can seriously deplete your finite willpower reserves. This habit also requires a sense of confidence in your abilities— a conviction that what you’re doing is important and will succeed. (Location 1243)</li><li>In the final accounting, the journalistic philosophy of deep work scheduling remains difficult to pull off. But if you’re confident in the value of what you’re trying to produce, and practiced in the skill of going deep (a skill we will continue to develop in the strategies that follow), it can be a surprisingly robust way to squeeze out large amounts of depth from an otherwise demanding schedule.

This location can be as simple as your normal office with the door shut and desk cleaned off (a colleague of mine likes to put a hotel-style “do not disturb” sign on his office door when he’s tackling something difficult). If it’s possible to identify a location used only for depth— for instance, a conference room or quiet library— the positive effect can be even greater.

For example, you might institute a ban on any Internet use, or maintain a metric such as words produced per twenty-minute interval to keep your concentration honed.

(Location 2199)</li><li>this strategy asks that you perform the equivalent of a packing party on the social media services that you currently use. Instead of “packing,” however, you’ll instead ban yourself from using them for thirty days. All of them: Facebook, Instagram, Google +, Twitter, Snapchat, Vine— or (Location 2238)</li><li>After thirty days of this self-imposed network isolation, ask yourself the following two questions about each of the services you temporarily quit: 1. Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service? 2. Did people care that I wasn’t using this service?

(Location 2280)</li><li>The “great and profound mistake which my typical man makes in regard to his day,” he elaborates, is that even though he doesn’t particularly enjoy his work (seeing it as something to “get through”), “he persists in looking upon those hours from ten to six as ‘the day,’ to which the ten hours preceding them and the six hours following them are nothing but a prologue and epilogue.” This is an attitude that Bennett condemns as “utterly illogical and unhealthy.” (Location 2300)</li><li>with the rise of the Internet and the low-brow attention economy it supports, the average forty-hour-a-week employee— especially those in my tech-savvy Millennial generation— has seen the quality of his or her leisure time remain degraded, consisting primarily of a blur of distracted clicks on least-common-denominator digital entertainment. If Bennett were brought back to life today, he’d likely fall into despair at the lack of progress in this area of human development.

In other words, this strategy suggests that when it comes to your relaxation, don’t default to whatever catches your attention at the moment, but instead dedicate some advance thinking to the question of how you want to spend your “day within a day.” (Location 2330)</li><li>figure out in advance what you’re going to do with your evenings and weekends before they begin. (Location 2335)</li><li>One of the chief things which my typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change— not rest, except in sleep. (Location 2346)</li><li>If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughout all your waking hours, you’ll end the day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed, than if you instead allow your mind to bathe for hours in semiconscious and unstructured Web surfing. (Location 2348)</li><li>Drain the Shallows (Location 2355)</li><li>Very few people work even 8 hours a day. You’re lucky if you get a few good hours in between all the meetings, interruptions, web surfing, office politics, and personal business that permeate the typical workday. (Location 2369)</li><li>Fewer official working hours helps squeeze the fat out of the typical workweek. Once everyone has less time to get their stuff done, they respect that time even more. People become stingy with their time and that’s a good thing. They don’t waste it on things that just don’t matter. When you have fewer hours you usually spend them more wisely. (Location 2371)</li><li>37signals implemented something radical: The company gave its employees the entire month of June off to work deeply on their own projects.

(Location 2403)</li><li>The implication is that once you’ve hit your deep work limit in a given day, you’ll experience diminishing rewards if you try to cram in more. Shallow work, therefore, doesn’t become dangerous until after you add enough to begin to crowd out your bounded deep efforts for the day. At first, this caveat might seem optimistic.

(Location 2420)</li><li>Schedule Every Minute of Your Day (Location 2423)</li><li>Schedule every minute of your day. Here’s my suggestion: At the beginning of each workday, turn to a new page of lined paper in a notebook you dedicate to this purpose. Down the left-hand side of the page, mark every other line with an hour of the day, covering the full set of hours you typically work. Now comes the important part: Divide the hours of your workday into blocks and assign activities to the blocks. (Location 2440)</li><li>There might be time blocks for lunch or relaxation breaks. To keep things reasonably clean, the minimum length of a block should be thirty minutes (i.e., one line on your page). This means, for example, that instead of having a unique small box for each small task on your plate for the day— respond to boss’s e-mail, submit reimbursement form, ask Carl about report— you can batch similar things into more generic task blocks. You might find it useful, in this case, to draw a line from a task block to the open right-hand side of the page where you can list out the full set of small tasks you plan to accomplish in that block. (Location 2446)</li><li>Cross out the blocks for the remainder of the day and create new blocks to the right of the old ones on the page (I draw my blocks skinny so I have room for several revisions). On some days, you might rewrite your schedule half a dozen times. Don’t despair if this happens. (Location 2457)</li><li>In my own daily scheduling discipline, in addition to regularly scheduling significant blocks of time for speculative thinking and discussion, I maintain a rule that if I stumble onto an important insight, then this is a perfectly valid reason to ignore the rest of my schedule for the day (Location 2480)</li><li>With structure, on the other hand, you can ensure that you regularly schedule blocks to grapple with a new idea, or work deeply on something challenging, or brainstorm for a fixed period— the type of commitment more likely to instigate innovation. (Recall, for example, the discussion in Rule #1 about the rigid rituals followed by many great creative thinkers.) And because you’re willing to abandon your plan when an innovative idea arises, you’re just as well suited as the distracted creative to follow up when the muse strikes. (Location 2491)</li><li>Quantify the Depth of Every Activity (Location 2500)</li><li>An advantage of scheduling your day is that you can determine how much time you’re actually spending in shallow activities.

(Location 2543)</li><li>Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget (Location 2548)</li><li>What percentage of my time should be spent on shallow work? This strategy suggests that you ask it.

(Location 2626)</li><li>I, too, am incredibly cautious about my use of the most dangerous word in one’s productivity vocabulary: “yes.” It takes a lot to convince me to agree to something that yields shallow work. (Location 2630)</li><li>Another tactic that works well for me is to be clear in my refusal but ambiguous in my explanation for the refusal. The key is to avoid providing enough specificity about the excuse that the requester has the opportunity to defuse it.

For the reasons stated above, I’ll only respond to those proposals that are a good match for my schedule and interests.

(Location 2687)</li><li>The default social convention surrounding e-mail is that unless you’re famous, if someone sends you something, you owe him or her a response. For most, therefore, an inbox full of messages generates a major sense of obligation. (Location 2691)</li><li>By instead resetting your correspondents’ expectations to the reality that you’ll probably not respond, the experience is transformed. The inbox is now a collection of opportunities that you can glance at when you have the free time— seeking out those that make sense for you to engage. But the pile of unread messages no longer generates a sense of obligation.

If you have a question, he diverts you to a public location to post it. Centeno thinks it’s wasteful to answer the same questions again and again in private one-on-one conversations. If you make it past this step, he then makes you commit to, by clicking check boxes, the following three promises: I am not asking Antonio a style question I could find searching Google for 10 minutes. I am not SPAMMING Antonio with a cut-and-pasting generic request to promote my unrelated business. I will do a good deed for some random stranger if Antonio responds within 23 hours.

(Location 2723)</li><li>The sender filter is a small but useful step toward a better state of affairs, and is an idea whose time has come— at least for the increasing number of entrepreneurs and freelancers who both receive a lot of incoming communication and have the ability to dictate their accessibility. (Location 2726)</li><li>interrogative e-mails like these generate an initial instinct to dash off the quickest possible response that will clear the message— temporarily— out of your inbox. A quick response will, in the short term, provide you with some minor relief because you’re bouncing the responsibility implied by the message off your court and back onto the sender’s. This relief, however, is short-lived, as this responsibility will continue to bounce back again and again, continually sapping your time and attention. (Location 2738)</li><li>the right strategy when faced with a question of this type is to pause a moment before replying and take the time to answer the following key prompt: What is the project represented by this message, and what is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this project to a successful conclusion?

(Location 2777)</li><li>Process-centric e-mails might not seem natural at first. For one thing, they require that you spend more time thinking about your messages before you compose them. In the moment, this might seem like you’re spending more time on e-mail.

If you don’t, you’ll never find time for the life-changing big things.” (Location 2812)</li><li>A commitment to deep work is not a moral stance and it’s not a philosophical statement— it is instead a pragmatic recognition that the ability to concentrate is a skill that gets valuable things done.
