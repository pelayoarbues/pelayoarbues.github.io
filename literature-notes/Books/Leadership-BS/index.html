(Location 217)</li><li>I began the writing of Leadership BS with a simple, albeit ambitious, goal: to cause people to rethink, to reconceptualize, and to reorient their behaviors concerning the important topic of leadership. (Location 227)</li><li>But the leadership industry also has its share of quacks and sham artists who sell promises and stories, some true, some not, but all of them inspirational and comfortable, with not much follow-up to see what really does work and what doesn’t. (Location 248)</li><li>what speaks the loudest in the leadership industry seems to be money, rather than evidence-based, useful knowledge. The way leadership gurus try to demonstrate their legitimacy is not through their scientific knowledge or accomplishments but rather by achieving public notoriety— (Location 250)</li><li>Leaders fail their people, their organizations, the larger society, and even themselves with unacceptable frequency. (Location 261)</li><li>This is not a book describing the manifest and many failures of leaders. It is a book to help you understand some of the causes of those failures. (Location 280)</li><li>The leadership industry has failed. Good intentions notwithstanding, there is precious little evidence that any of these recommendations have had a positive impact. Indeed, many prescriptions for leaders are often more problematic and invalid than generally acknowledged. (Location 313)</li><li>the leadership industry is large and prominent, but, notwithstanding its magnitude and reach, (2) workplaces in the United States and around the world are, for the most part (as there are obviously exceptional places on best-places-to-work lists), filled with dissatisfied, disengaged employees who do not trust their leaders; (3) leaders at all levels lose their jobs at an increasingly fast pace, in part because they are unprepared for the realities of organizational life, and thus, (4) the leadership industry has failed and continues to fail in its task of producing leaders who are effective and successful, and it has even failed to produce sufficient talent to fill leadership vacancies. (Location 332)</li><li>the qualities we actually select for and reward in most workplaces are precisely the ones that are unlikely to produce leaders who are good for employees or, for that matter, for long-term organizational performance. (Location 347)</li><li>Although it might be cathartic to bemoan the evidence that positive leadership qualities often go unrecognized and unrewarded while their opposite produces career advancement and wealth, such moralizing changes nothing about organizational decision-making and also does little to help you in your own career challenges. (Location 350)</li><li>the construct of leadership was invented to account for unusually good— or unusually bad— performance as a way of creating a relatively simplified account of the world that made personal control seem possible. (Location 378)</li><li>Robert Sutton wrote a book entitled The No Asshole Rule. (Location 401)</li><li>the so-called leaders whom many people work for are either abusive bullies or just out of touch with their subordinates. (Location 406)</li><li>the vast majority of employees are unhappy with their work, disengaged, and hoping for a different job. (Location 436)</li><li>So whatever other things the leadership research, writing, speaking, blogging, and programs are doing, making workplaces better is clearly not one of them. (Location 442)</li><li>If, as scores of studies demonstrate, leadership affects engagement, satisfaction, and turnover, the sorry state of these workplace indicators provides compelling evidence of leadership failure. (Location 449)</li><li>Gentry concluded that “one of every two leaders and managers” is “estimated to be ineffective (that is, a disappointment, incompetent, a mis-hire, or a complete failure) in their current roles.” (Location 483)</li><li>this leadership expert, working from extensive research, concluded that 50 percent of leaders were failures. Yet another review of the research literature on leadership concluded that “the base rate for managerial incompetence in any organization is quite high,” 28 while still a different summary concluded that about half of the occupants (Location 485)</li><li>This divergence in the interests between corporate leaders and the groups in which they are members appears prominently in the growing literature on sociobiology, an evolutionary approach to understanding social behavior that speaks to the discrepancy between what’s good for individuals and the groups in which they are members. (Location 534)</li><li>“The problem is that for a social group to function as an adaptive unit, its members must do things for each other. Yet, these group-advantageous behaviors seldom maximize relative fitness [for a given individual] within the social group.” (Location 539)</li><li>Social psychologists also have long acknowledged the inherent tension between the need for leaders to help groups function effectively, and the personal interests of group leaders to maximize the power differences they enjoy over others and hold on to and exploit for their own benefits. 39 (Location 541)</li><li>Leaders frequently focus, hopes and blandishments notwithstanding, primarily on their own careers and what’s good for them. (Location 544)</li><li>thought— there is far from a complete correspondence between what is good for a company, or for that matter, a unit within that company, and what is good for the company’s or unit’s leader. (Location 557)</li><li>This neglect of what’s good for the individual interests of leaders might be one reason so many recommendations have so little traction in the real world: while leadership research may not be that interested in leader (as opposed to group or organizational) well-being, leaders almost always are. (Location 564)</li><li>The leadership industry is so obsessively focused on the normative— what leaders should do and how things ought to be— that it has largely ignored asking the fundamental question of what actually is true and going on and why. (Location 595)</li><li>There are no “barriers to entry” into the leadership industry; no credentials, rigorous research, knowledge of the relevant scientific evidence, or anything else required to pass oneself off as a leadership expert. (Location 601)</li><li>many of the people offering leadership advice have (a) either never held a leadership position, or (b) if they have, were notoriously unsuccessful in their leadership role, or (c) often promulgated leadership prescriptions almost completely inconsistent with their own behavior. (Location 605)</li><li>the study of charismatic leadership lacks a precise definition of the term and also an understanding of the psychological and behavioral mechanisms that presumably produce results from charisma. (Location 631)</li><li>what gets inspected gets affected. (Location 640)</li><li>Armstrong concluded that “teacher ratings are detrimental to students.” (Location 664)</li><li>any evaluation of leadership development begins and ends with participant feedback.” (Location 674)</li><li>measuring entertainment value produces great entertainment, not change; measuring the wrong things crowds out assessing other, more relevant indicators such as improvements in workplaces. (Location 679)</li><li>Improvement comes from employing measurements that are appropriate, those that are connected to the areas in which we seek improvement. In the case of leadership, that appropriate measurement would include assessing the frequency of desirable leader behaviors; actual workplace conditions such as engagement, satisfaction, and trust in leadership; and leaders’ careers— measures that are notable by their absence not only in use but even from much of the discussion of leadership-development activity. (Location 680)</li><li>when Hewlett-Packard had a positive and strong organizational culture and senior leadership cared about that culture, people were held accountable for the results of anonymous employee surveys conducted throughout the company and reported on a work-unit basis. (Location 685)</li><li>evaluates managers by their ability to attract and retain talent, and where people can lose their jobs if their units experience excessive voluntary turnover. (Location 691)</li><li>there is lots of talk about the importance of culture and people, but there are not many actions consistent with such talk. (Location 693)</li><li>the senior leadership, not liking the results of employee surveys measuring engagement or trust or satisfaction, simply decides to stop doing them. After all, as one CEO reportedly said, “If we’re not going to change things, why raise people’s expectations by asking them their opinions about aspects of the work culture that we really don’t care about.” (Location 694)</li><li>Measuring results, measuring leader behaviors, and assessing whether or not prescriptions get implemented would go a long way to both highlighting and then altering the current sad state of affairs in most workplaces. Without baseline measurements of leader and workplace conditions, it is simply impossible to understand what to do to make improvements. (Location 697)</li><li>expanding evaluations and measurement to incorporate not just unit performance and even customer or employee satisfaction but also what happens to leaders’ careers, including their jobs, their salaries, and their career progress. And when we see, as we will frequently throughout this book, the different effects of a leader’s traits or behaviors on a company’s performance versus his or her own success, we will see the need to understand why there is the divergence in interests and how to make things work better for both sides. (Location 701)</li><li>promulgate professional standards of practice. Such standards include prioritizing systematic evidence over stories or examples, basing practice to the greatest extent possible on the best evidence, and, most important, seeking to ensure that practitioners are knowledgeable and have at least some requirement to keep up with the progress of medical science. (Location 708)</li><li>doing the opposite of what the leadership industry advocates is sometimes a much better, more reliable path to individual success. (Location 721)</li><li>There are, in this domain as in many others, trade-offs, and the frequently unacknowledged trade-off between what is good for the individual and good for the group needs to be front and center in understanding why there is so much leadership failure over such a long time. (Location 722)</li><li>Rosabeth Moss Kanter described it more than thirty years ago, the organization’s last dirty secret— something that nice people don’t talk about, let alone teach to executives. 1 (Location 732)</li><li>“I have a soul-crushing job. I need hope.” (Location 743)</li><li>many people have soul-crushing jobs and work for ineffective or even abusive leaders, and they apparently think the job of business schools and professors is to provide inspiration and hope. So many leadership players provide what the “customers” want. (Location 744)</li><li>you are a leader seeking to actually change a workplace’s conditions so as to improve employee engagement, satisfaction, or productivity, or if you are an individual seeking to chart a course to a more successful career, inspiration is not what you need. What you need are facts, evidence, and ideas. (Location 753)</li><li>To build a science of leadership, you need reliable data. To learn from others’ success, you need to know what those others did. The best learning, simply put, comes from accurate and comprehensive data, either qualitative or quantitative. But the leadership business is filled with fables. (Location 764)</li><li>The stories leaders tell or have others tell about themselves on their behalf are primarily designed to create an attractive legacy. Sometimes such accounts are, to put it delicately, incomplete. Because these tales are designed to build an image and a reputation, they do not constitute qualitative data from which to learn. (Location 768)</li><li>not only do individuals perceive themselves to be above average for most positive attributes and believe that the qualities in which they excel are the most important— the so-called above-average effect7— but individuals will also selectively remember their successes and forget their failures or shortcomings. (Location 793)</li><li>Even in the absence of motivational reasons to misremember and misreport, people invariably recall past events with considerable error, even if they try to be as honest and accurate as possible. (Location 797)</li><li>talking about the past we lie with every breath we draw.” I misunderstood this sentence, when I first read it, as a statement about the fallibility of memory; now I see it as a statement about the distorting power of speech— or of speech’s pretentious cousin, writing. Because one of the strangest things I’ve learned . . . is how the things you write begin to blend with, and then replace, the things you experienced. 9 (Location 805)</li><li>The evolutionary benefit of self-deception is clear: if you can deceive yourself, you can much more easily and convincingly deceive others, and thereby obtain the benefits that accrue from being able to successfully fool people. (Location 811)</li><li>We often engage in astonishingly little due diligence to assess the accuracy of what we hear. (Location 823)</li><li>Freud commented on religion’s functions in ways that nicely parallel how and why the myths of leadership are created and persist whether or not they are true: These [religious ideas] . . . are not the residue of experience or the final results of reflection; they are illusions, fulfilments of the oldest, strongest and most insistent wishes of mankind; the secret of their strength is the strength of these wishes. We know already that the terrifying effect of . . . helplessness aroused the need for protection. . . . Thus the benevolent rule of divine providence [or a benevolent leader] allays our anxiety in face of life’s dangers, the establishment of a moral world order ensures the fulfilment of the demands of justice, which within human culture have so often remained unfulfilled. 13 (Location 831)</li><li>the all-too-frequent examples of people who profess one set of behaviors and act the opposite produce cynicism on the part of those who see the hypocrisy. (Location 849)</li><li>In our quest for inspiration over insight, we wind up with neither. We get no inspiration, as we learn that the leadership stories are more fiction than fact.

(Location 2828)</li><li>Deming argued that if there are performance problems and quality defects, one needs to understand how those problems arise almost naturally as a consequence of how a system has been designed— and then fix those design flaws. Put simply, attack the problems by fixing the system, not scapegoating the necessarily fallible human beings working in and operating that system— whether or not they deserved it. (Location 2829)</li><li>In the absence of any sustained movement to create better management and organizational governance systems that rely more on the “wisdom of crowds” 13 and less on the hope that one’s leader is better than average and not overly self-interested, it seems sensible to look out for oneself. And as I argue next, systems based on people looking out for themselves have performance advantages, at least in some circumstances, not only for the people working in them but for the system itself. (Location 2840)</li><li>Take care of yourself and assiduously look out for your own interests in your life inside work organizations. (Location 2849)</li><li>Miller noted that the norm of self-interest has substantial explanatory power, in part because people assume self-interest is operating and thereby take actions that make the norm of self-interest self-fulfilling through their very behaviors. (Location 2852)</li><li>presume that others are acting on the basis of their self-interest, and you will be better equipped to forecast and understand their actions. (Location 2860)</li><li>as Adam Grant noted in his bestselling book Give and Take, people who are “givers,” those who are generous with their time and with their help of others, are often the most successful in building networks of support and therefore in their careers. (Location 2866)</li><li>Grant also summarized research, including his own, that found that givers were not only among the most successful individuals, they were also among the least successful, and he provided advice about how to be generous without being a patsy. (Location 2868)</li><li>Grant noted that “in the workplace, givers are a relatively rare breed.” (Location 2870)</li><li>cooperative cultures are quite fragile, as are cooperation and trust in prisoner’s dilemma games. Once individualistic values come to dominate, 18 or once people defect in prisoner’s dilemma situations, 19 trust and cooperation are difficult if not impossible to rebuild. (Location 2872)</li><li>It is interesting, to say the least, that while many people and much social science theory presumes that individual voters, acting at least partly out of their own self-interest, can produce better electoral outcomes than any other system, inside economic entities, which in some cases dwarf the size of at least some governments, a different calculus is advocated. But just maybe self-interest is as sensible a motive inside companies, (Location 2892)</li><li>Societies generally seem to celebrate competition as individuals seek their own advantage. That is, once again, until we consider the internal workings of organizations. So once inside a company, people are not only expected to collaborate rather than to compete with each other but, more important, to cooperate with their leaders (or bosses, to use a less noble term), to voluntarily subordinate themselves to their leaders’ interests and commands. (Location 2906)</li><li>beyond the better decisions and more efficient results in political and economic systems produced by self-interest seeking, there is a third benefit: encouraging individuals to be responsible for their own well-being helps them come to think of themselves as fully functioning adult human beings. (Location 2912)</li><li>Encouraging people to seek and then to follow benevolent leaders— to put their trust and faith in these individuals who, because they are human, will nevertheless be invariably flawed— strikes me as seeking to in some measure infantilize otherwise competent working adults. (Location 2914)</li><li>The world is often not a just or fair place, our hopes and desires notwithstanding. Get over it. Take care of yourself and watch out for your interests. If others do as well, all the better. (Location 2921)</li><li>as Jim Collins pointed out in Good to Great, unrealistic optimism and a failure to see the situation as it is can be not only unhelpful— it can be fatal. He called this the Stockdale paradox, after James Stockdale, a U.S. military officer held captive for eight years during the Vietnam war. (Location 2960)</li><li>Because they seek to avoid uncomfortable truths, individuals sometimes avoid seeking medical help in the presence of symptoms that concern them, not wanting to hear a dire diagnosis. Of course, such behavior often makes the situation worse, as real medical problems frequently become more dangerous and difficult the longer they are left untreated. (Location 3053)</li><li>And people who want to be successful— to become or to remain insiders— avoid telling the truth if such truth could be perceived as a criticism of other insiders, people, or companies with power. (Location 3056)</li><li>had a choice. I could be an insider or I could be an outsider. Outsiders can say whatever they want. But people on the inside don’t listen to them. Insiders, however, get lots of access and a chance to push their ideas. . . . But insiders also understand one unbreakable rule: They don’t criticize other insiders.

(Location 3072)</li><li>Stop Confusing the Normative with the Descriptive, and Focus More on What Is (Location 3078)</li><li>many people in the industry believe that it is important to primarily if not exclusively present models of what should be rather than what is. This belief in emphasizing what ought to (Location 3080)</li><li>Watch Actions, Not Words (Location 3100)</li><li>As the clichéd phrase “walking the talk” makes clear, there is often some degree of disconnection between leaders’ pronouncements and what is written about them, and what leaders actually do and their success doing it, a fact we have seen throughout this book. (Location 3115)</li><li>Pay attention to what is really going on and to people’s real behavior and performance. Become a skilled and unbiased observer, and, to the extent you can, eliminate hopes and expectations from your observations. Everyone has to navigate a number of organizations, each with its own leader and culture. You would be well served to pay attention to what you see and not to what people are saying and the lovely values and sentiments they are expressing. Rhetoric and reality are often decoupled in social life, and in leadership it is almost the norm. (Location 3129)</li><li>Sometimes You Have to Behave Badly to Do Good (Location 3133)</li><li>there are occasions when you have to do bad things to achieve good results. (Location 3136)</li><li>The point is that sometimes to do good, you have to have the courage and wisdom to perform harmful, painful, actions. (Location 3140)</li><li>Leadership is no different. Making change, improving situations, getting things done, winning in very competitive environments, often requires being willing and able to engage in behaviors and exhibit qualities that some people might find repugnant. (Location 3145)</li><li>Machiavelli teaches that in a world where so many are not good, you must learn to be able to not be good. The virtues taught in our secular and religious schools are incompatible with the virtues one must practice to safeguard those same institutions. . . . Machiavelli has long been called a teacher of evil. The author of “The Prince” never urged evil for evil’s sake. The proper aim of a leader is to maintain his state (and, not incidentally, his job). Politics is an arena where following virtue often leads to the ruin of a state, whereas pursuing what appears to be vice results in security and well-being. In short, there are never easy choices, and prudence consists of knowing how to recognize . . . the hard decisions you face and choosing the less bad as what is the most good. (Location 3158)</li><li>often to do good things, even great things, people need to be willing to take whatever actions are required, and to not shy away from tough fights, unpopularity, and, yes, even decisions that skirt the edge of illegality. (Location 3171)</li><li>Advice to Leaders Depends on the Ecosystem in Which They Are Operating (Location 3180)</li><li>In the case of leadership, much of the advice has been largely noncontingent— leaders should be authentic, truthful, caring for others, inspiring of trust, and so forth, attributes put forward as universal qualities and behaviors to be developed. (Location 3184)</li><li>A process of differential selection, attraction, and retention, along with the criteria used to determine who advances up a hierarchy, together tend to ensure that workplaces are filled with people who are largely consistent in their leadership style with each other, particularly at the higher ranks. (Location 3187)</li><li>Consistency in behavior also comes from the process of social learning, in which people figure out what to do by looking at what others in their immediate environment are doing and what the results are. (Location 3189)</li><li>The answer to how to be a better leader also depends on knowing the environment you are in, its norms, and, most important, what behaviors will be seen as demonstrating weakness and incompetence and what actions will signal strength, confidence, and skill. (Location 3192)</li><li>Stop the Either-Or Thinking (Location 3200)</li><li>thinking of things as black or white makes it much more difficult to deal with the real world and its many complications. (Location 3204)</li><li>Forgive, so that people will be more inclined to admit their mistakes, but remember, so that they and their peers will be less likely to make the same mistakes again. (Location 3224)</li><li>“even in the most extreme circumstances— like the financial crisis— directors bore little consequence for their poor decisions.” (Location 3270)</li><li>The problem with leadership is at its core a story of disconnections: • the disconnect between what leaders say and what they do;• the disconnect between the leadership industry’s prescriptions and the reality of many leaders’ behaviors and traits;• the disconnect between the multidimensional nature of leadership performance and the simple, noncontingent answers so many people seek;• the disconnect between how the leadership industry is evaluated (happy sheets that tap inspiration and satisfaction) and the actual consequences of leader failures (miserable workplaces and career derailments);• the disconnect between leader performance and behavior and the consequences those leaders face;• the disconnect between what most people seem to want (good news, nice stories, emotional uplift) and what they need (the truth);• the disconnect between what would make workplaces better and organizations more effective, and the base rate with which such prescriptions get implemented.
