Within eight years it would post some of the biggest losses in U.S. banking history, rattle the financial markets to the point of briefly depressing the U.S. dollar, watch its cumulative stock performance fall more than 80% behind the general stock market, face a serious takeover threat from a rival California bank, cut its dividend for the first time in 53 years, sell off its corporate headquarters to help meet capital requirements, see the last Giannini family board member resign in outrage, oust its chief executive, bring a former CEO out of retirement to save the company, and endure a barrage of critical articles in the business press, with titles such as &ldquo;The Incredible Shrinking Bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;Better Stewards (Corporate and Otherwise) Went Down on the Titanic.&rdquo; Anyone predicting such a fall as the decade began would have been viewed as a pessimistic outlier.

If companies such as Motorola (MOT), Circuit City (CCTYQ), and Fannie Mae (FNM)—icons that once served as paragons of excellence—can succumb to the forces of gravity, then no one is immune. If companies such as Zenith and A&P, once the unquestioned champions in their fields, can plummet from great to irrelevant, then we should be wary about our own success. (

<a href=https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/five-stages-of-decline.html rel=noopener>five stages of decline</a> we uncovered in our research for <em>How the Mighty Fall</em>, leaders can substantially increase the odds of reversing decline before it is too late—or even better, stave off decline in the first place. Decline can be avoided. The seeds of decline can be detected early. And decline can be reversed (as we&rsquo;ve seen with notable cases such as IBM (IBM), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Merck (MRK), and Nucor (NUE)). The mighty can fall, but they can often rise again. (

<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h63h06j4tm69qhrg7w7w8nm4 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Great enterprises can become insulated by success; accumulated momentum can carry an enterprise forward for a while, even if its leaders make poor decisions or lose discipline. Stage 1 kicks in when people become arrogant, regarding success virtually as an entitlement, and they lose sight of the true underlying factors that created success in the first place (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h63gpk7fmxww9s2bz4p8b7vt rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>When the rhetoric of success (&ldquo;We&rsquo;re successful because we do these specific things&rdquo;) replaces penetrating understanding and insight (&ldquo;We&rsquo;re successful because we <em>understand why</em> we do these specific things and under what conditions they would no longer work&rdquo;), decline will very likely follow. (

<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h63grftbqysejsrmy1h92yt6 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>The best leaders we&rsquo;ve studied never presume they&rsquo;ve reached ultimate understanding of all the factors that brought them success. For one thing, they retain a somewhat irrational fear that perhaps their success stems in large part from fortuitous circumstance. Suppose you discount your own success (&ldquo;We might have been just really lucky/were in the right place at the right time/have been living off momentum/have been operating without serious competition&rdquo;) and thereby worry incessantly about how to make yourself stronger and better-positioned for the day your good luck runs out. What&rsquo;s the downside if you&rsquo;re wrong? Minimal: If you&rsquo;re wrong, you&rsquo;ll just be that much stronger by virtue of your disciplined approach. But suppose instead you succumb to hubris and attribute success to your own superior qualities (&ldquo;We deserve success because we&rsquo;re so good/so smart/so innovative/so amazing&rdquo;). What&rsquo;s the downside if you&rsquo;re wrong? Significant. You just might find yourself surprised and unprepared when you wake up to discover your vulnerabilities too late. (

<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h63gsv83nqw4dczts2abvvv1 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Hubris from Stage 1 (&ldquo;We&rsquo;re so great, we can do anything!&rdquo;) leads right to Stage 2, the Undisciplined Pursuit of More—more scale, more growth, more acclaim, more of whatever those in power see as &ldquo;success.&rdquo; Companies in Stage 2 stray from the disciplined creativity that led them to greatness in the first place, making undisciplined leaps into areas where they cannot be great or growing faster than they can achieve with excellence—or both. When an organization grows beyond its ability to fill its key seats with the right people, it has set itself up for a fall. Although complacency and resistance to change remain dangers to any successful enterprise, <em>overreaching</em> better captures how the mighty fall. (

Taking action inconsistent with your core values is undisciplined. Investing heavily in new arenas where you cannot attain distinctive capability, better than your competitors, is undisciplined. Launching headlong into activities that do not fit with your economic or resource engine is undisciplined. Addiction to scale is undisciplined. To neglect your core business while you leap after exciting new adventures is undisciplined. (

Those in power start to blame external factors for setbacks rather than accept responsibility. The vigorous, fact-based dialogue that characterizes high-performance teams dwindles or disappears altogether. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h63gwm71968x738xer2rhgr5 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Bill Gore, founder of W.L. Gore & Associates, articulated a helpful concept for decision-making and risk-taking, what he called the &ldquo;waterline&rdquo; principle. Think of being on a ship, and imagine that any decision gone bad will blow a hole in the side of the ship. If you blow a hole above the waterline (where the ship won&rsquo;t take on water and possibly sink), you can patch the hole, learn from the experience, and sail on. But if you blow a hole below the waterline, you can find yourself facing gushers of water pouring in, pulling you toward the ocean floor. And if it&rsquo;s a big enough hole, you might go down really fast, just like some of the financial firm catastrophes of 2008. To be clear, great enterprises do make big bets, but they avoid big bets that could blow holes below the waterline. (

By lurching for a quick salvation or by getting back to the disciplines that brought about greatness in the first place? Those who grasp for salvation have fallen into Stage 4. Common &ldquo;saviors&rdquo; include a charismatic visionary leader, a bold but untested strategy, a radical transformation, a dramatic cultural revolution, a hoped-for blockbuster product, a &ldquo;game-changing&rdquo; acquisition, or any number of other silver-bullet solutions. Initial results from taking dramatic action may appear positive, but they do not last. (

In Stage 5, accumulated setbacks and expensive false starts erode financial strength and individual spirit to such an extent that leaders abandon all hope of building a great future.
