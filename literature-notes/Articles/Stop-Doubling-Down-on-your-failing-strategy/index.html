Q: What is an escalation of commitment?
A: It is holding on too long to a strategy that was once successful.
Q: What is the sunk cost fallacy?
A: It is a bias that reinforces the tendency of organizational decision makers to tacitly ignore events that undermine their current strategy and double down on the initial decision in order to justify their prior actions.
Q: What is the best way to prevent escalation of commitment?
A: Companies can reduce their exposure to escalation by adopting practices such as setting decision rules, protecting dissenters, and reinforcing the anticipation of regret.<ol><li>What are the main purposes of this document?</li><li>What policies or regulations does this document discuss?</li><li>What recommendations or conclusions does this document make?</li></ol></li><li>URL:

The British music company HMV did so, and it went from commanding a 40% share of Britain’s music market to receivership in just over a decade. (

(

to stick to an existing course of action, no matter how irrational. (

(
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxvexawnaezfrr1h5gr45sck rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Personal identification. Research in both psychology and sociology suggests that people’s identities and social status are tied to their commitments. Thus withdrawing from a commitment may result in a perceived loss of status or a threat to one’s identity. At the same time, no executive likes to admit that a decision was wrong, because the ability to make smart decisions is part of what defines a good executive. (

If withdrawing from a course of action implies certain and immediate losses, decision makers often prefer to allocate more resources to continue with it—despite low expected returns—if they see any chance of turning the situation around (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxvf09rey0gn4sw87sy800sr rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>The illusion of control. This bias clearly reinforces the previous two: People habitually overestimate their ability to control the future (

Intel, for example, when it was still focused on producing DRAM memory chips rather than microprocessors, made a rule that production capacity would be allocated to products according to several criteria, particularly margin per wafer. This objective formula was designed when no concrete decisions were yet at stake. (

A wealth of psychological experimentation suggests that people have an inherent bias toward completing tasks— whether that means finishing a plate of food or seeing a project throug (

Dissenters often believe that they alone have reservations about a course of action; as a consequence, they remain silent. Others, meanwhile, interpret their silence as agreement. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxvf2t24trzw2k3wersz1kq6 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>instead of leaving the decision to a small number of top managers, this decision rule tapped into the collective wisdom of the company’s highly knowledgeable onthe-ground executives. When we asked the company’s CEO why he didn’t
just make these investment decisions himself, he replied, “Why would I know any better than all the other very experienced television executives in my firm? It is not my job to make the decision; it is my job to make sure the best decision gets made.” (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxvf8ex2z13dxngj4fnpq44m rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Companies that have doubled down on a failing strategy are usually not without dissenters. The trouble is that dissenters can be ruthlessly suppressed—and the knowledge that this might happen itself acts as a suppressant. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxvfb8h64xexfv3amxp3f8b3 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Consider the following situation: The three members of a top management team are debating whether to continue investing in the company’s current technology or switch to a new one. They agree that two criteria are relevant: (1) whether the current technology is likely to require substantial additional investment; (2) whether the new technology is likely to improve significantly over time. They also agree that they should switch only if it appears that both criteria are met. Let’s suppose that Team Member 1 thinks that
both criteria are met, Member 2 thinks that only the first is met, and Member 3 thinks that only the second is. The team’s recommendation will depend on how those opinions are aggregated. As shown in the exhibit “Rethink How You Count Votes,” if you tally by team member (which academics describe as conjunctively), the team will continue investing in the existing technology, because it’s clear that two out of three members don’t believe both criteria have been met. But if you tally by criterion (disjunctively, in academic jargon), each garners two votes for and only one against, meaning that the company should switch to the new technology. Note that in both situations, the criteria are exactly the same and the team members hold exactly the same opinions. It’s the procedure that makes the difference. (

create an environment in which people do speak up, share dissenting information, and challenge the organization’s course of action. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxvfc9hrs8syt7d0z4pa9gry rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Providing anonymous feedback channels.
Creating safe channels that lower-level executives can use to share opinions is one way to surface dissent. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxvfw2x9w8aqeyxk8q4vfh4j rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>To be sure, smaller teams reduce coordination and communication costs and reach consensus faster. But larger teams have more information-processing capacity and a greater diversity of perspectives. We recommend enlisting 10 to 14 executives when it comes to debating the company’s long-term strategy. (

strategy-making team, companies should increase its diversity. More than two decades’ worth of research demonstrates that diverse groups produce more innovative and creative solutions, are better at solving complex problems, and are more capable of incorporating novel information. But diversity must be carefully calibrated (

RETHINK HOW YOU COUNT VOTES
A team of three must recommend whether its company should change its core technology. Managers agree that this should happen only if both of two criteria are met. What this team recommends will depend on how the members’ votes are counted.

for subordinates by expressing their own doubts about a current strategy. To be sure, leaders are not used to doubting themselves—a situation reinforced by the fact that followers expect them to be decisive and confident. But the payoff for occasionally admitting some fallibility can be significant. (

You can reduce the likelihood of escalation if you give responsibility for a strategic move to people who did not advocate or initiate that move. (
