The work you choose needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that offers scope to do great work. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9dee0efac2tpyk16p05yb rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>That sounds straightforward, but it&rsquo;s often quite difficult. When you&rsquo;re young you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re good at or what different kinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not even exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at 14, most have to figure it out (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9eexq7t8cmf3zrr79ta3n rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you&rsquo;re not sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going. You&rsquo;ll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9et0cjqf3pk1xg6693g2b rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Don&rsquo;t let &ldquo;work&rdquo; mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger project, but you&rsquo;ll be driving your part of it. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9f96xq0mekm1h9actx6ks rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that would bore most other people? That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9gax0fvf2b1mp9740vs09 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Once you&rsquo;ve found something you&rsquo;re excessively interested in, the next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9gqacfjkqpkvgekxj4cd7 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often has a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math. It would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears, embrace it. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9h6mts7qw8fq95ft6ks1e rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren&rsquo;t interested in them — in fact, especially if they aren&rsquo;t. If you&rsquo;re excited about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have enough expertise to say precisely what they&rsquo;re all overlooking, that&rsquo;s as good a bet as you&rsquo;ll find. [
<a href="http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html?s=09#f3n" rel=noopener>3</a>] (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9hka31225r5y9a0k24789 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone who&rsquo;s done great work has done it, from painters to physicists. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9hsq2ztmzmsshtw4ysk67 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s essential to work on something you&rsquo;re deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9jr99gvn2b4csgj0hq5g3 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9jx8jc2bgae2m308jw0t0 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack in the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there&rsquo;s a whole world inside. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9k5b8tyqgd77tdghkz2ta rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Let&rsquo;s talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring out what to work on. The main reason it&rsquo;s hard is that you can&rsquo;t tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at it. And in the meantime you&rsquo;re not doing, and thus not learning about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose late based on very incomplete information. [

<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9mjhhcpvnbqwx4hbcv6xe rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Ambition comes in two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9n2jkexkzn2vgpw1nmtvs rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>They expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what it&rsquo;s really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal trajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9nkbw3vw5ckqewqw65s3e rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>It would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted that the system not only can&rsquo;t do much to help you figure out what to work on, but is designed on the assumption that you&rsquo;ll somehow magically guess as a teenager. They don&rsquo;t tell you, but I will: when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you&rsquo;re on your own. Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on the assumption that everyone does. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9p5evnbm9w9tp18mg613n rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>What should you do if you&rsquo;re young and ambitious but don&rsquo;t know what to work on? What you should not do is drift along passively, assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action. But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read biographies of people who&rsquo;ve done great work, it&rsquo;s remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions. [
<a href="http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html?s=09#f5n" rel=noopener>5</a>] (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9q483rw05n27cds4tapyx rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Fields change as you learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need to give different types of work a chance to show you what they&rsquo;re like. But a field should become <em>increasingly</em> interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s probably not for you. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9qrc8k4hhgp8wgedjjn60 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Don&rsquo;t worry if you find you&rsquo;re interested in different things than other people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you&rsquo;ll be productive. And you&rsquo;re more likely to find new things if you&rsquo;re looking where few have looked before. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9r43e6njac8yw97rmx970 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>One sign that you&rsquo;re suited for some kind of work is when you like even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9r9vzkkhdr5qqv7c9hwat rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>If in the course of working on one thing you discover another that&rsquo;s more exciting, don&rsquo;t be afraid to switch. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9rhf59fdnt8y8wn94349e rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>If you&rsquo;re making something for people, make sure it&rsquo;s something they actually want. The best way to do this is to make something you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests, this will also get you your initial audience. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4b9rwbrvsd3wwjgdnxf3jvx rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>This <em>should</em> follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most exciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason I mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong. Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down that route, you&rsquo;re lost. [

<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4ba09z4dmqesn7wacpr2yyr rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you&rsquo;re trying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics, other people&rsquo;s wishes, eminent frauds. But if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you&rsquo;ll be proof against all of them. If you&rsquo;re interested, you&rsquo;re not astray. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4ba0s73setkaagk3cj22mra rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy, but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of obstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it does take a good deal of boldness. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4ba143gx5w4v7rgv1tenx1r rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>But while you need boldness, you don&rsquo;t usually need much planning. In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants. (

What&rsquo;s the source of this apparent contradiction? It&rsquo;s that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the way you look at the world. We see the world through models that both help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas become obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard. That&rsquo;s how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover: they&rsquo;re easy to see after you do something hard. (

So what you&rsquo;re looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of crazy. How do you recognize these? You can&rsquo;t with certainty. Often ideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are the right kind of crazy tend to be exciting; they&rsquo;re rich in implications; whereas ideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing. (

You notice a thread protruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it just gets longer and longer. So don&rsquo;t require a question to be obviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict that. It&rsquo;s hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to predict how much will unravel if you pull on it. (

Big things start small. The initial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start lots of small things. (

But don&rsquo;t forget about them. When you&rsquo;ve gotten further into the subject, come back and check if they&rsquo;re still there.

That may seem a stretch, but it&rsquo;s not merely some weird thought experiment. It&rsquo;s the truth, economically, and in the best case it&rsquo;s the truth intellectually as well.
