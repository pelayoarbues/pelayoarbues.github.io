I’m eager to preserve the distinction and clarify responsibility. So I do not think machines should use first-person pronouns, but should describe who is responsible for the system or simply respond in a machine-like way. (

We (humans, not Michael) send them out to do things (Kaminski and Nitzschner, 2013). We coordinate our actions with them — sometimes over distances. They coordinate their actions with us. (

They have something like a mind. They have their own goals, and sometimes their goals and our goals may be aligned, and sometimes not. Sometimes we can change their minds. Sometimes they can change our minds. I think that makes them seem like non-human intelligences (

In our experience, the acceptance issue is about poor match of the user’s request to the chatbot’s set of intents (i.e., mapping request to response). We’ve been seeing that the current LLMs seem to provide more appropriate responses, perhaps exactly because they do not use the previous generation’s mapping of utterances-to-intents. I’m not sure that people reject chatbots that use a pronoun. I think they reject chatbots that provide poor service. We may need to do more systematic analyses of the factors that lead to acceptance and the factors that lead to failure. (

• Ben takes a clear stance on a binary distinction between human and non-human intelligence and highlights the importance of responsibility: designers & developers should take responsibility for AI-infused tools.
• Michael, in comparison, embraces a more fluid attitude towards intelligence as a continuum by presenting numerous analogies with human-animal relationships. He argues that there is a “murky region in-between” human intelligence and the intelligence exhibited by amoebas, which is interesting and underexplored as a design space. (
