&lt;h1 id="1-new-rules">1. New rules&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Most potent negotiating tool: open questions. Calibrated questions buy you time, make the counterpart feel they are in control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ask the same open questions over and over until they give you everything you want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We humans are irrational and that is the reason why fixed process based on logic are not the best techniques for negotiating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seminal negotiating scholar works focused on problem solving and agreeing in a mutual game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kahneman brought the irrationality of man, that we are not completely selfish and that feeling is a form of thinking. Tastes are not stable. And he differentiated two systems. System 1 is our fast animal mind. System 2 is slow and logical. System 1 is more influential because it guides our rational thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are able to affect system 1 in your counterpart then you can guide his system 2 and modify his responses. Emotional intelligence needs to be central to effective negotiation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People want empathy. They want to be listened. ==Tactical empathy== is active listening aims to balance emotional intelligence and assertive skills of influence.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="life-is-negotiation">Life is negotiation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The majority of interactions in our daily life are related to an animalistic urge: I want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Negotiation serves 2 function:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Information gathering&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Behaviour influence&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="2-be-a-mirror">2. Be a mirror&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Be open minded, question assumptions and be ready to update your beliefs for each new piece of information you get.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Goal is to identify what they actually need and get them feel safe to talk about they want. ==Wants represent the aspiration, needs the minimum to survive, and they make us vulnerable. ==&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best effective mode of influence is how we enact. Radiate warmth and acceptance. Voice is the most powerful tool for verbal communication. Voice tones for negotiators: positive/playful,
Late night FM DJ voice (deep, soft, slow), and assertive voice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of the time positive/playful, talking relaxed and smiling. Positive frame of mind make people collaborate instead of fight and resist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The late-night FM DJ voice conveys the idea &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m in control&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mirroring, aka isopraxism, is imitation of speech patterns, body language, vocabulary, tempo and tone of voice. S very effective mirror is to repeat last three words.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-confront">How to confront&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Use the late-night FM DJ voice&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Start with &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mirror&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Silence for 4 seconds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Repeat&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="key-lessons">Key lessons&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Language of negotiation is a language of conversation and rapport to establish relationships and get people to talk and think together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key lessons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A great negotiators aims to use skills to reveal the surprises is certain to find&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t commit to assumptions. View as hypothesis and use negotiation to test them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Negotiation is not a battle of arguments, it&amp;rsquo;s a process of discovery The goal is to uncover as much information as possible&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To quiet voices in your head focus the other person and what they have to say&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Slow it down. Hurry makes people think they are not heard&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put a smile in your face.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Voices available:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The late night FM DJ voice. Use selectively to make a point. You create an aura of authority without triggering defensiveness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The positive/playful voice. Default voice Easygoing person. Attitude is light and encouraging. Key is relax and smile&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Direct or assertive voice. Will cause problems and create pushback&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Mirrors work magic. Repeat last three words. Facilitates bonding.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="3-dont-feel-their-pain-label-it">3. Don&amp;rsquo;t feel their pain, label it&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Emotions aren&amp;rsquo;t obstacles and the means. If you can perceive other people emotions you can turn them to your advantage.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tactical-empathy">Tactical empathy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Empathy is &amp;quot; the ability to recognise the perspective of a counterpart, and the vocalisation of that recognition.&amp;quot; Try to understand a situation from others perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>==Tactical empathy is understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings so you increase your influence in the moments that follow.==&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can mold your audience by how you approach and talk to them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neural resonance is when our brains start to allign.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1
&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>
&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Exercise. When some talks imagine that you are that person Visualise yourself in the position they describe with as much detail as you can
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="labeling">Labeling&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Use tactical empathy to recognise and understand emotions, turn them into words and respectfully repest back at them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Labeling builds intimacy. It is a way to validate emotions by acknowledging them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Spot feelings by noticing words, tone and body language. Pay close attention to changes to your words.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once spotted say it out loud. Labels can be statements or questions. They begin with words such as: &amp;ldquo;It seems like&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;It sounds like&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;It looks like&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Silence and listen. Invite the other person to reveal.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Neutralise the negative, reinforce the positive. Peoples emotions has two levels: the surface or presenting behaviour and the underlying feeling that motivates the behaviour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best way to deal with negativity is to observyit without reaction and judgement Then consciously label each negative feeling and replace it with positive, compassionate and solution based thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Labeling fears show our counterpart that we understand&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="accusation-audit">Accusation audit&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>List every bad thing your counterpart could say about you.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-lessons-1">Key lessons&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These tools foster human connection and create more meaningful and warm relationships.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Imagine yourself in your counterpart situation. By acknowledging the other person&amp;rsquo;s situation they know you are listening and they may disclose useful information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be open about negatives&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Silence. After you label a barrier or mirror a statement let it sink in&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Label tour counterparts fear to diffuse their power.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>List the worst thinks that the other party could say about you before the other person can.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use labels that reinforce positive perception and dynamics&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="4-beware-yes-master-no">4. Beware yes, master no&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Pushing hard for yes does not get you closer to win
&amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo; is pure goal. It provides a great opportunity to clarify what you really want by eliminating what you don&amp;rsquo;t want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No is the starting point of the negotiation. It allows you to be in control, maintain status quo. ==Give people the power of say no, the power of veto==. Great negotiators seek No because they know it is when negotiation begins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3 kinds of yes: counterfeit, confirmation and commitment. The last one is the one that you want because is the one that lesds to a promise of action.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are the voice to make them reach your goal as it was theirs. For that you need to fully grasp what they want. And you get there not with fake smiles but by asking for no.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Saying no makes the speaker feel they are in control and creates security.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">2

&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Instead of asking do you have a few minutes to talk, ask Is now a bad time to talk?

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>You can get a no by mislabeling emotions or desires or ask them what they don&amp;rsquo;t want.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-lessons-2">Key lessons&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Disagreeing makes the other part to feel safety and in control. Triggering no gets you to what&amp;rsquo;s really at stake.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Break the habit of chasing the yes. Pushing people to yes makes people defensive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No usually means wait or that is not what I want. Learn how to hear it calmly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saying no makes the speaker feel safe, secure and in control.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sometimes the only way to make the people engange and devote some time to you is by forcing a no. &amp;ldquo;It seems like you want this project to fail&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Negotiate in their world. Let them convince themselves that the solution you want is their own idea.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If a potential business partner is ignoring you contar then with s no oriented question.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="thats-right">That&amp;rsquo;s right.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Behavioural Change Stairway Model: active listening, empathy, rapport, influence and behavioural change. You can start exerting influence is when the counterpart says &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s right&amp;rdquo;. It is a subtle epiphany.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good summary can trigger a &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s right moment.&amp;rdquo;. It can be a combination of rearticulating the meaning of what is said plus the acknowledgement of the emotions underlying that meaning. Paraphrasing+ labeling = Summary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You are right&amp;rdquo; is not a good sign because that might agree but they don&amp;rsquo;t own the ppconclusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-lessons-3">Key lessons&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s right moment indicates there is a real understanding between the parties. And when you convince someone that you understand their dreams and feelings, it w
I&amp;rsquo;ll be possible to influence them&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The more s person feels understood, the more likely they are to be open to constructive behaviour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That&amp;rsquo;s right is better than yes, it can create breakthroughs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use summary to trigger that&amp;rsquo;s right.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="bend-their-reality">Bend their reality&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Negotiation is never a linear formula. There are leverages in unspoken needs and thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t compromise. Splitting the difference is usually ineffective and disastrous. No deal is better than a bad deal. Mismatched black and brown shoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="deadlines-make-time-your-ally">Deadlines: make time your ally&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Time is a crucial variable in negotiations. Deadlines make people take irrational decisions. Negotiation deadlines are usually imaginary, arbitrary and almost always flexible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Patience is a formidable weapon if you believe you got all the time you need to make the negotiation right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Deadlines cut both ways and when s negotiation is over for one side is over for the other too.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-fair-word">The fair word&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Three ways to use it:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I just want what is fair. Triggers feelings of defensiveness and discomfort. The best response is &amp;ldquo;I apologize and go back where I started treating you unfairly and let&amp;rsquo;s fix it&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have given you a fair offer. It attempts to distract your attention and make you give up. Best response: Fair? 3 secs pause. Use a label: it seems like you are ready to provide the evidence to support this&amp;quot;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want you to feel you are treating fairly at all times. So please stop at any time if you feel I&amp;rsquo;m being unfair, and we will address it&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="discover-emotional-drivers-behind-what-the-other-party-values">Discover emotional drivers behind what the other party values&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You have to try to get what the counterpart problems, pains and unmet objectives are. If you can get at what petare really buying you can tell them a vision of their problem that leaves the proposal as the perfect solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does a babysitter sell? Not child care, but a relaxed evening.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bend-their-reality-1">Bend their reality&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Prospect theory by Kahneman. People prefer sure things over probabilities.It is ==certainty effect==.
And people will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains. ==Loss aversion==&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Prospect theory tactics&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Anchor their emotions
Inflame the other party loss aversion by acknowledging all their fears. Once they have low expectations, play on their loss aversion.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Let the other guy go first, most of the time. Let the other side anchor monetary negotiations. Beware that the other side might go for an extreme anchor to bend your reality. If you are dealing with a rookie or someone who does not know the value you can open the negotiation and offer an extreme anchor. Or with an equally informed probyou can move first to make the negotiation go faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Establish a range. Instead of I am worth 110k$, say at top places like X,bpeoplr in this job get between 130k and 170k. It does not move the counterpart in defensive position but thinking at higher levels. If you offer a range expect them to come in at the low end.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pivot to non monetary terms you can bend the other reality by talking nonmonetary terms. For instance, for a talk you may get a low offer, but maybe they don&amp;rsquo;t mind doing some promotion of you helping you with your brand.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Use odd numbers and less rounded. Say 37263 sounds like the result of s thoughtful calculation. They se serious, permanent and immovable.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Surprise with a gift. You can get the counterparty with a mood of generosity by staking an extreme anchor, and after their rejection offering an unrelated gift.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>Calibrated open questions remove lets you rule the conversation without sounding pushy. Asking for questions is a powerful tool to suspend unbelief.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Data Strategy Course.

&lt;p>Data Strategy helps you identify a manageable strategic use case. What business want to achieve in which data can help business suceed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>5 strategic use case areas:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>How data can help everyone in an organisation make better and faster decisions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using data to gain customer and market insights. Understand your customers &amp;gt; successful in markets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Smarter products and services. Personalisation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using data to improve and automate the way a business operates&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data monetisation. Turning data into income.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Create a strong business case for using data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="1-data-driven-decision-making">1. Data driven decision making&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Two key elements:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Self-service. A company gives more people access to more data so they can answer their business questions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Curated dashboards. Idenbtify and communicate the strategic data sets and metrics. Identify information needs.
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>identify Key business questions
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Analyse strategy and goals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For each goal define questions that need answering
3.Identify metrics or data sets to answer those questions&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The right data leads to smarter decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Common pitfalls:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dont give executives access to self service tools with the hope that they will find their own answers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dont put irrelevant or badly visualised data into dashboards or reports&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Drowning in data while thirsting for insights&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="challenges-related-to-self-service-data-exploration">Challenges related to self service data exploration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Creating data cubes and connecting it with a data viz tool does not ensure data-driven decision making&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working with data and setting up a firms data infrastructure&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Leadership should promote data driven decision making. Build the right culture of delegated decision making
Ensure an improved data literacy. Training and emphasis on developing data-related skills&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Provide the right tools to your employees. Once the tools are in place, additionatl training and support is required. Data café in Walmart or data translators between business and analytics teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Provide access to the right quality data. Use single source of truth, invest in master data management, conduct data audits.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="asking-key-business-questions-first">Asking key business questions first&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Good questions outrank easy answers. Paul Samuelson&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Data driven decision making starts by defining the questions that need to be answered. Then we need to define how to use data to answer the questions in an informed way&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Key Business Questions&lt;/code> capture business information needs and are the biggest unaswered questions or what managers need to know about their organisation. Focus our attention on the questions that really matter and provide guidance for collecting meaningful and relevant data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The power of clear Key Business Questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Telecom wanted to know most profitable customers and profitability over the long run. Rephrased as CLTV. How loyal are profitable customers. Churn rates.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Good questions lead to good answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="how-do-you-develop-good-business-questions">How do you develop good business questions?&lt;/h4>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Start with strategy. Clarify strategic objectives and start developing KBQs. The fewer KBQs the better.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Engage people in the KBQ design. List &amp;gt; subject matter experts &amp;gt;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Try to phrase your KBQs as open questions. Open up the dialogue.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Focus your KBQs on the present and the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep your KBQs short and clear.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Refine your KBQs by using them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="give-people-access-to-data">Give people access to data&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You democratise data driven decision making. Avoid analytics team bottleneck.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="curating-the-most-important-data-insights">Curating the most important data insights&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For the most strategic data needs we need curated dashboards. A well design dashboard helps monitoring the key business goals.
Remember not everyone can read graphs. Include text based descriptions.
It allows companies to control narrative and data storytelling.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="2-using-data-to-understand-your-customers">2. Using data to understand your customers&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Data allows companies to understand their customers and the market conditions they are operating in.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Main approaches to data monetization
1. Create extra value for your organizaction from data
2. Sell data to your customers or other interested third parties.
- It can be a by product. Visa
- Cosmose Ai. Anonymized mobile phone data.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ask the right questions first before collecting datra with the idea of selling it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Create distinct commercial units charged with the topic of data monetization. Benefit of saving other divisions strategic focus and complete responsability to the dedicated unit.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You have to link data use case to business strategy to ensure data delivers maximum value for your business.
Looking what your business is trying to achieve, identify potential solutions through the use of data.
Dont limit yourself to a small number of use cases at this stage, we will be narrowing down options in the second step. Now we need to explore the many ways in which data could help your organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can come from any of the discussed areas:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>How data can help everyone in an organisation make better and faster decisions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using data to gain customer and market insights. Understand your customers &amp;gt; successful in markets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Smarter products and services. Personalisation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using data to improve and automate the way a business operates&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data monetisation. Turning data into income.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="link-to-a-strategic-goal">Link to a strategic goal&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is vital to link each use case to a business strategic goal. If you cannot question yourself if it is really worth the expense.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Structured&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Unstructured&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>

&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Find the best combination to get the most useful insights for your business&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="structured-vs-unstructured">Structured vs unstructured&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Structured is organised data, can be put in tabular form easily.
Unstructured, unorganised data, cannot be put in tabular form easily. 80-90%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Semi-structured have some elements of structure (metadata) for instance photo metadata.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="internal-vs-external">Internal vs external&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Internal data: Owned or collected by the organization. Useful in the long run and it is useful advantage. Usually cheap or free to access.
External data: A third party data. All information which exists outsiede. Publicly availabe or pivately owned by 3rd parties. Data brokers. Paid in most cases, less control of the quality, less reliable for strategically important and business critical insights. Ponder the risks and benefits from external data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually companies rely too much on internal data, can biased perspective. The sweet spot usually requires a mix of internal and external data.&lt;/p>

Own data that is essential to your business. Own or not own? It it easy to own internal data, but with external data can create future problems for your business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do i ensure the correct rights are in place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Include your legal team when dealing with data privacy.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="executing-and-revisiting-your-strategy">Executing and revisiting your strategy&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The execution of a firm&amp;rsquo;s data strategy needs to start at the top. The senior leadership team needs to have buy-in and if that happens, everyone else will follow. It usually creates a top down ripple effect where the importance of data as a core asset is understood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Attitudes that kill the data strategy in its inception:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We are not a data company. Every business is a data business.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Working with data and implementing a data strategy in practice is too expensive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We already have more data than we need.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everyone else is already ahead of us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our customers aren&amp;rsquo;t interested.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Education and concrete examples of the industry you are operating in usually works great to achieve sponsors.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-data-strategies-fail">Why data strategies fail&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Data strategy needs to be in sync with the goal of the company.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lack of communication&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Staff engangement&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lack of communications between teams. ==End-to-end process owners==&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lack of specialized workforce&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>What you need in general to prevent these issues is good communication and a high level of buy-in across the organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="creating-a-data-culture">Creating a data culture&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Building a robust data culture means getting people on board with the firm&amp;rsquo;s data strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a culture shift for many organizations to go from relying exclusively on their intuition and insticts but on decisions that are justified with data and facts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One proven way to establish a strong data culture is to involve some of the brightest employees during the process of forming a data strategy and implementing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If one of your primary aims is to use data to understand your customers better, then it makes sense to involve the head of marketing and key marketing personnel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is important that a firm&amp;rsquo;s leadership team make an effort to engage people in their company&amp;rsquo;s data strategy underlining how will improve the business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a great idea to showcase examples and studies from other companies to demonstrate how data helped a company in practice, and examples that are from your own industry are even better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Negativity can be contagious. If people on your team or even worse, entire teams become skeptical and pessimistic, try to understand what problems they have in their work and explain how data can be helpful to make their job easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Build trust, be transparent.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="revisiting-the-data-strategy">Revisiting the data strategy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Review it periodically.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Do you have different business needs? The faster industry changes, the more often we should review our data strategy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Has technology evolved?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Close physical proximity&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Attentive courtesies&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Belonging cues: behaviours that create safe connection in groups. Three qualites:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Energy, invest in the exchange that is occurring&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Individualization, each person treated as unique and valued&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Future orientation, the relationship will continue&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These cues mean you are safe here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Group performance depends on behaviour that communicates we are safe and connected.l&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Google story with ads and Jeff Dean, acting as kindergarten solving tough problems.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Answer questions about Wipro
But the second group were asked questions about their best times in work and other questions about themselves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A t-shirt with their name&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Missileers lack of connection. No connection, no future, no safety.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gregg Popovich. Spurs. Unselfish behaviours. Move close enough to players to almost nose touching. He tells you the truth and loves youto death. Watches documentaries about things that matter more than basketball and pose lots of questions to the team as if they were in s seminar. Hug&amp;rsquo;em and hold&amp;rsquo;em. Food and wine connection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Successful cultures are not happy, light-hearted places. They are energized and engaged. Their members do not look for happiness but to solve hard problems together. High candor feedback moments, uncomfortable truth telling, confronting where the group is and where it ought to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Magical feedback consists of cues that state here is a safe place to give effort:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You are part of this group&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This group is special, we have high standards here&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I believe you can reach those standards.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Popovich belonging cues:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Personal up-close connection that translates I care about you. Individual connection&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Performance feedback, relentless criticism that translates we have high standards here. Middle distance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Big picture perspective. Conversations about politics, food that translates life is bigger than basketball Larger context where interaction is taking place.&lt;/li>

- Managing stakeholders is one of the most important functions a DS manager is involved:
- Building trust. Perception of your work is really important to build trust.
- Explain what&amp;rsquo;s happening behind the scenes
- Factor in unknowns when giving estimates: Explain there is data you never looked at. If you have never done, say it.
- Be explicit about when someone will hear from you next. Be more predictable. Be clear of hidden costs and explain how your constraints impact delivery. RTB = run-the-business work you need to do to keep the lights on. Make this a visible part of your roadmap. Be clear that maintenance is needed.
- DACI: Driver, Approver, Consulted, Informed. Use
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DGRlGq8nffTpLg5OB1fjnKNY4O4j6_yogq18q88HafE/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noopener">template&lt;/a>
- Don&amp;rsquo;t act like a service team. You don&amp;rsquo;t let them treat you like a service desk. No one likes to be treated like a service team, on the other hand people usually want requests to be well described. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to build transactional relationship. Learn the domain because it is critical for interpretation and mapping to semantic concept that is valuable for the organization. Domain knowledge helps not getting nontrivial knowledge. Put yourself in the stakeholder&amp;rsquo;s shoes, they might have lots of pressure or they might have time constrains. You should commit to the same goals, you should feel responsible to make PMs get faster to a goal. This also creates tighter bonds.
- Build engagement: If we want our organizations to use data in their decision making process we need to help them to do it
- Make your work easy to consume:&lt;br>
- Focus on what your stakeholders can control, if you give them good choices backed up by your analysis they will demand more.
- Make your work linkable, make it concrete somehow: documentation, a dashboard, a slide deck. It helps making decisions without you in the loop. Easy to reference, easy to build upon.
- Know when to make a snack vs prepare a meal. : Modularise analysis in small chunks that people can consume. A meal can also be made up of small components that can be digest easily.
- Be predictable:
- Reliability and consistency earn more trust than speed
- Decide how you will push value to stakeholders
- Act like you have paying customers:
&lt;a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-semantic-versioning/" rel="noopener">Semanting versioning&lt;/a> is a good mental model, to frame how significant your contributions are.
- Find ways to surprise and delight:
- Share unexpected findings and thoughtful innovations
- Packages them well. If you do this it is really important to contextualise. Be a sumellier, build taste with easy wines, then move to more complex wines. Give people things that you know they like, show them gradually what it is possible.
- Don&amp;rsquo;t overindex on this. Use it judiciously.
- Set a good example, then be willing to let go. Show them how it is to use well data, but don&amp;rsquo;t try to be always the mediator. Let them work and explore the data, make mistakes and let it go.

&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Good leaders find critical points that can leverage the effectiveness of efforts and concentrate resources on them. The core of strategic work is discovering critical factors in a situation and designing a way to coordinate actions to deal with those factors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good strategy identifies the greatest challenges and includes a set of coherent actions to overcome them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Strategy is usually used a synonym of ambition, success or innovation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Logical structure of strategy (the kernel):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Diagnosis: Identifies obstacles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guiding policy: Approach to deal with obstacles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coherent action: Coordinated policies, resource commitments, and actions to carry out the guiding policy.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Good strategy is not goal setting, but problem solving.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good strategy involves applying strengths (resources) to obtain advantages in the most promising opportunities.
Natural sources of strength:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Coherent strategy: creates strength through the coherence of is design, the coordination of policies and actions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Subtle shifts of viewpoint. A reframing of competitive situation can create advantage and weaknesses.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="part-i-good-and-bad-strategy">Part I Good and bad strategy&lt;/h1>
&lt;h1 id="1-good-strategy-is-unexpected">1. Good strategy is unexpected&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Most companies don&amp;rsquo;t have good strategy so having one is a source of natural advantage. The don&amp;rsquo;t expect you to have a coherent strategy that involves resources, coordinated actions, policies and resources to overcome an important obstacle.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="apple">Apple&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Two months away from bankruptcy, Jobs rejoined Apple. He cut Apple to the core, from 15 Desktop models to 1, killed printers and peripherals, emulated Dells supply chain in Asia and brought operating system from Next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His next strategy was to wait for the next big thing (window of opportunity). This is not a recipe for success&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="desert-storm">Desert storm&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Left hook maneuver to attack Irak. It was military strategy 101, butgood strategy is unexpected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Coordinating and focusing resources is important instead of dedicating them to unconnected targets&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="2-discovering-power">2. Discovering power&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Viewing things from fresh perspective uncovers strengths advantages threats and weaknesses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David and Goliath story shows that apparent weaknesses and apparent strength can be overcome.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="walmart">Walmart&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Case study that helps uncover hidden power in situations. Conventional wisdom said that &amp;ldquo;A full line discount store nerds a population vase of at least 100k&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a strategy exercise you should consider the competition even when it is not at the core of the exercise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this case the tipping point is that the operating unit is not the store but a network of stores.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cold-war-strategy">Cold war strategy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Us advantage was technology but the strategy was to to engage in developments that imposed exorbitant costs in USSR, by focusing in areas that were expensive to counter.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Use your relative advantages to impose out of proportion costs on the opposition and complicate his problem of competing with you&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is the discovery of the Hidden power in the situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="bad-strategy">Bad strategy&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>It is not the absence of good strategy it is the result of dysfunctional leadership and specific misconceptions&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fluff: inflated words to create the illusion of high level thinking&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Failure to face the challenge fails to recognise the challenge&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mistaking goals for strategy. Statements of desire instead of plans to face the obstacles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bad strategic objectives: when fail to address critical issues or impracticable&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>bad strategy is long on goals and short on policy and action&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="fluff">Fluff&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Buzzwords combined with superficial and obvious statements.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="failure-to-face-the-problem">Failure to face the problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A strategy must define a challenge problem or obstacle and state a response or approach to overcome it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="mistaking-goals-for-strategy">Mistaking goals for strategy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Find the most promising opportunities for the business looking at who your buyers are, who you compete with and what opportunities exist. Then build a strategy that channels your energy to one or two of the most attractive opportunities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Performance goals or rolling budgets are not strategies&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bad-strategic-objectives">bad strategic objectives&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A general manager or CEO decides the general strategic objectives and subgoals for each part of the organisation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A leader uses strategy to bridge the path between overall goals and actionable specific objectives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A long list of objectives is not a strategy. A good strategy focuses energy and resources on very few pivotal objectives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another form of bad strategic objectives is to pursue unattainable objectives no one knows how to tackle with current resources and skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>When a leader characterizes the challenge as underperformance, it set the stage for bad strategy. Underperformance is a result. The true challenges are the reasons of underperformance.&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="why-so-much-bad-strategy">Why so much bad strategy?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Bad strategy is the result of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Unwillingness to choose: avoidance of taking decisions facing opportunity costs. Strategy requires focus and setting aside some goals. Universal buy-in might indicate the absence of choice. In organisations the older the inertia the larger resistance to change. See Arrow decision theory and Condorcet&amp;rsquo;s paradox&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Template style strategy. Max Weber&amp;rsquo;s charismatic Vs formal leaders. Peter Drucker did not agree on the need of charisma to be an effective leader. Charismatic, transformational leadership has led to Template style strategic planning which usually involves things like vision, mission, values. This frees people to think on the true challenges they are trying to csolve.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Positive thinking displaces critical thinking and good strategy&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="the-kernel-of-good-strategy">The kernel of good strategy&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Elements&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Diagnosis: Describes the challenge. Answers the question &amp;ldquo;What is it going on here?&amp;rdquo;. So diagnosis is a judgement of facts, a simplified model that allows us to tackle complexity and advance in problem solving. This model focuses in factor that can be addressed with policy. **It is the why.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guiding policy: Overall approach to face the challenge. Provides direction without explicitly defining what to do. Many people call strategy to guiding policy, but stating a diagnosis you can find alternative guiding policies. A good guiding policy tackles the challenge in the diagnosis by leveraging sources of advantage. It can be in itself an advantage, for instance by reducing the uncertainty of what to do, how to compete how to organise. It also helps focusing resources on specific set of challenge. **It is the what.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A set of coherent actions that carry out the guiding policy in a coordinated way. Strategy must decide priorities, and a great way to sharpen strategy is the necessity to act. We always hope that with a great design we can accomplish several conflicting objectives but the truth is that we need strategy to choose what to do and what to abandon. The coordination and coherence of action acts as a prominent source of advantage. Coherence imposed by a system by design, not adhoc, the kind of unnatural coordination that would not exists if it weren&amp;rsquo;t without strategy. Centralization has many caveats (coordination interrupts and de specialized people, among others) but some benefits only appear if decisions are properly coordinated. **It is the how.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="part-ii-sources-of-power">Part II Sources of power&lt;/h2>
&lt;h1 id="using-leverage">Using leverage&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Concentrate force, focus, energy and minds in pivotal objectives.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Anticipation of market demand and competitors behaviour and reactions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pivotal objectives magnify the effects of focused energy and resources.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Concentration means that sometime focusing on a limited number of objectives you reach a threshold level (a critical level of effort necessary to affect the system). It is also wise to increase perceived effectiveness by concentrating on targets that catch attention.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="proximate-objectives">Proximate objectives&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Create feasible objectives with the skills and resources at hand. Sending man to the moon Vs the war on drugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Solving ambiguity. Proximate objectives does wonders to organizational energy and focus. Challenges usually appear impossible because of complexity and uncertainty. A good leader can pass the organisation a simpler and solvable problem.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Taking a strong position and creating options. The more dynamic the situation the poorer your forecast. In uncertain scenarios make moves that improve your position and create opportunity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hierarchies of objectives. Your goal when you know how to crawl, must be to learn to walk. Once you learn to walk you can aim at running.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="chain-link-systems">Chain-link systems&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Chain link systems are those limited by its weakest link. Once there exists a weak link ain&amp;rsquo;t no point in strengthening the rest of the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Getting stuck. Higher quality in a link that is not matched with higher quality in other links may cause worse results.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Getting unstuck. Quality matching in chain link systems requires working without inmediate returns.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Excellence. A well designed chain linked system is really difficult to replicate. For instance many IKEA policies are different from the norm (traditional furniture retailers does no carry large inventories, normal retailers don&amp;rsquo;t do own designs or use catalogs instead of sales people) and work coherently in a chain like logic.
![[IMG_20220705_232755.jpg]]&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="using-design">Using design&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We can learn from military strategy the importance of design:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Premeditation. Prior guidance with design and planning in advance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anticipation. Of the thoughts and behaviours by others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Design of coordinated action. Choreography of a designed plan. Strategists are designers working to solve a problem not decision makers that choose among different options that are presented to them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Design must find sweet spots which must balance with coordination among activities to make the whole strategy effective. Each part of the system must be reconsidered to the needs of the rest of the system. This means that design has to optimise performance while keeping in mind tradeoffs between capabilities and tight integration. The greater the challenge the greater need of resources or the greater the need for coherent, integrated, design-type strategy. Resources and integration are partial substitutes of each other. Integration costs are related to the difficulty to create tight integrations, narrower focus, more fragile and less responsiveness to change..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Potent resource position can eventually lead to produce profit without great effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Easy life breed laxity: success leads to laxity that leads to decline&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Current profit is usually thought to be the result of current actions but it may be the harvest of planting seasons long past.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The challenger usually faces the incumbent by leveraging a tight design -type strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Most incumbent will loosen their tight integration and begin to rely more on accumulated resources and less on clever design. They will lose the discipline of tight integration, allowing independent fiefdoms to flourish and adding so many products and projects that integration becomes impossible. Faced with the natural slowing of growth over time, they will try to create the appearance of youthful vigor with bolt-on acquisitions. Then, when their resource base eventually becomes obsolete, they, too, will become prey to another generation of upstarts. It is the cycle of life.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h1 id="focus">Focus&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In order to identify a company&amp;rsquo;s strategy byou have to do your own analysis you cannot fully buy what HBR is telling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To begin you usually start by examining the competitive environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then look at each policy of the company and notice those that are different from the norm in the industry. We then try to distinguish the target they are trying to accomplish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>![[IMG_20220708_091247.jpg]]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Focus is the coordination of policies that produces extra power by interacting and overlapping effects. It denotes the application of that extra power to the right target.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Real world has an inner logic that is no secret but usually is under the radar. To spot the real strategy you must work hard analysing qualitative information.
Truth is that not all companies have a strategy. Strategy requires focus and many large companies pursue multiple goals at once without taking the max out of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="growth">Growth&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Growth by acquisition to ramp up KPIs without thoughtful strategy eventually leads to worse performance. Moreover when you buy a company, specially a public one you pay way too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Healthy growth it is the outcome of growing demand for special capabilities. It is the outcome of better products and services. The correct innovation processes usually leads to higher market share and a superior rate of profit.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="using-advantage">Using advantage&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Advantage results from asymmetries from competition. No company or organisation can have advantages at everything. You must exploit where you have advantages and avoid situations you are weak.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might be great at running 1500 meters, and you can do a good job running 10k, but probably you cannot wrestle a gorilla.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Porter&amp;rsquo;s competitive advantage is either lower costs than your competitors, or greater perceived value for your customers or a combination of the two.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sustainable competitive advantage requires that competitors cannot duplicate it. Isolating mechanisms are patents, reputation, network effects, huge economies of scale&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Competitive advantage is interesting when it can be updated, engineered and improved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wealth increases when competitive advantage increases and for that you need:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Deepening advantages. This could be achieved by cutting costs via improving processes a la Taylor or by increasing value by improving products via product development.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Broadening the extent of advantages by applying them to new markets. Extending a competitive advantage requires building on your strengths. Extensions based on proprietary know how might even enhance knowledge. Extensions based on brand reputation are risky because they can damage the core. For instance, pirates of Caribbean extend Disney brand to adventure movies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Creating higher demand for advantaged products or services. That higher demand might be because we add more users or because each buyer demands more. The process of engineering higher demand&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Block easy replication by competitors. The value of your business can be increased by reducing the risk of imitative competition. Patents, copyrights and brand recognition are entry barriers. Also creating a moving target, a product that is constantly evolving (not saying improving, just moving) makes it more difficult to be imitated.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="using-dynamics">Using dynamics&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Dramatical technical inventions and business model innovations create competitive advantages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another way is to exploit exogenous changes such as technology shifts, competition, politics and buyer perceptions. These changes might erode old advantages weakening existing leaders or enabling new ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The role of a leader is to ride waves of change and ensure the resources and innovation are channeled toward positions that will become advantages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The importance is not in forecasting but in understanding past and present and to be able to take advantage of a wave of change. For instance, the basis of success lately is related to software written by small teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to really challenge the experts you need to deep dive into the details and understand the fundamentals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to ride the waves of change you do not need to understand them completely right, just to do it better than your competitors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ways to understand industry transitions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Rising fixed costs: Growing fixed costs forces the industry to consolidate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deregulation: Changes in the rules that govern a market cause heavy modifications in the competitive landscape. Deregulated players and former monopolists are myopic of their actual costs so they might chase for years unprofitable market segments once the subsidies are gone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Predictable biases: People usually do not see that surges in demand peak and the decline to normal levels.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Incumbent response: incumbents resist change and transition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Attractor states: Potential efficient equilibrium that might be reach by the market.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="inertia-and-entropy">Inertia and entropy&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Inertia is the inability to adapt to changing circumstances. Understanding the inertia of rival can create windows of opportunity to win a market.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Inertia of routine. Standard routines define how an organisation process information and deal with change. You can overcome obsolete routines by hiring managers with better methods, or redesigning processes.a&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cultural inertia. Simplification helps breaking organizational culture inertia.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Inertia by proxy. Inertia created by old streams of profit when customers are too slow to replace products despite relative price or quality differences.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Entropy affects weekly managed organizations that tends to become less organised and focused.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Organizational renewal helps reducing risks associated to inertia and entropy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-science-of-strategy">The science of strategy&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>A new strategy is a hypothesis and it&amp;rsquo;s implementation, an experiment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Functional knowledge is created by experimenting with different strategies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Corporate culture and peak human performance with Dr Larry Senn</title><link>https://pelayoarbues.github.io/literature-notes/Podcasts/Corporate-culture-and-peak-human-performance-with-Dr-Larry-Senn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pelayoarbues.github.io/literature-notes/Podcasts/Corporate-culture-and-peak-human-performance-with-Dr-Larry-Senn/</guid><description>&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">

&lt;p>1st phd thesis on corporate culture (1969), first culture shaping consultancy firm (1978).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Corporate culture and productivity. It is easier to decide a change than to make people change.
Organizations as dysfunctional families, trust issues, resistence to change&amp;hellip; No matter how good is the idea, it is hard to implement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Companies, like people, has a personality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/malcolm-gladwell-tipping-point-theory-3026765" rel="noopener">Tipping point&lt;/a>, the culture is the greatest determinant of survival of an organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unsconscious resistence to change. You have to change people minds to curious instead of judgemental.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why don&amp;rsquo;t you complain about gravity? You don&amp;rsquo;t wake in the morning and say oh my, another day with gravity. Stop complaining about things you cannot do anything about. Stoicism powa.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have to untrain the blame culture. As a manager you have the win/lose mindset (prefer not lose) and also this mindset in which you cannot make mistakes. So if a project is falling behind you look for someone else to blame. But what you have to ask is what can you do in this context to make it work?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do change adults habits? You need an epiphany. Covid was an unfreezing moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Culture is the way people behave and work together: accountable vs victims, collaborative vs territorial, resist change vs open to change, curious vs judgemental. Culture is the same across the world, the difference is style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shadow of the leaders: How CEOs and senior leaders behave goes down in the organization. You need to start change at the top.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a huge void in people feeling appreciated and valued in organizations. Younger generation needs healthy organizacions with cultures that respect people, appreciative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Encouraging empowerment in teams: Training accountability + (inspiring, appreciating people for doing the right thing)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rate of change pushes the need of agile companies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Culture is the enabler of all initiatives. The main enablers of culture: having purpose, performance value: accountability. Bedrock of honest and integrity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Incentives for performance. Recognising culture. Appreciative feedback and constructive feedback. Got a recognised by your boss in front of your peers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cash rewards + jerk supervisors you won&amp;rsquo;t get the grass cut.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do you build trust? Openness builds trust. Transparency builds trust. Vulnerability builds trust. Leaders must show vulnearable, be open, consistent, dependable, appreciating&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Disconnected initiatives != transformative change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Leaders need to lead with the why, not the what. What it makes a difference, Why you are important to me. Values != leadership. Leaders need to model things in the organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ego factor in the culture for a balanced organization. If leaders are humble, vulnerable. Company with big ego = problems. Confidence and intention, not for ego.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Be here now. Be present. Not wandering mind.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big</title><link>https://pelayoarbues.github.io/literature-notes/Books/How-to-Fail-at-Almost-Everything-and-Still-Win-Big/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pelayoarbues.github.io/literature-notes/Books/How-to-Fail-at-Almost-Everything-and-Still-Win-Big/</guid><description>&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">

&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Success might be a combination of talent, hard work and luck. One might think that having a conscious strategy will do, but the truth is that we cannot disentangle the outcome and understand if it was this strategy or pure luck&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Calling bullshit requires a system. It is based on consistency, for instance in at least two dimensions of the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Personal experience&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Experience of people you know&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Experts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scientific studies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Common sense&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pattern recognition&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="the-tine-i-was-crazy">The tine I was crazy&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>He could talk to his cat,being a song or read a poem but he could not talk to other humans. This lead to doctors, psychiatry and loneliness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He had to speak at an event in front of 1000 people and he was wondering if he would be able to do it&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-day-of-the-talk">The day of the talk&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;code>when you stand in front of an audience your sensation of time is distorted. That's why inexperienced presenters speak too rapidly.&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He puts himself in that situation because he embraces failure as a path to learn&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="passion-is-bullshit">Passion is bullshit&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Passionate people show high energy and are persuasive about their passion but they are also less risk averse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Passion is a signal that you are good at something or that it is easy for you. Success causes passion more than passion causes success.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="goals-versus-systems">Goals versus systems&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Career advice by a CEO: Every time you land a new job you should start looking for a better one. Job seeking as an ongoing process as better deals has their own schedule. Instead of setting a goal such as his boss&amp;rsquo; job, his system was to continually look for better options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Goals makes you feel miserable once you achieve them. Systems makes you feel energetic as they succeed every time you apply the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can think of goals as situations in which once you succeed you are done, while systems are those that you do periodically with an expectation that they will get you to a better place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A system beats passion everytime.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="my-system">My system&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Build something easy to reproduce in unlimited quantities. This general strategy was narrow down with a focus on creativity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="deciding-versus-wanting">Deciding versus wanting&lt;/h1>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>if you want success, figure out the price then pay it&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Prices: sacrifice personal life for grades, putting off having kids, taking business risks&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Systems make the price lower so it may worth a go.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-selfishness-illusion">The selfishness illusion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In terms of generosity, three kinds of people:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Selfish&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stupid&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Burden on others&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Advocates for selfishness understood as a long run view of the right choices for you and others. For instance invest time on fitness, eating right, pursuing your career and spending quality time with your family and friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-energy-metric">The energy metric&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In order to make choices among different alternatives we can choose those that maximize ones energy. That leads to eating, dreamin, resting and also by having something in life that excites you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Energy is something that gives you a positive lift, mentally or physically. It might be blogging, writing a book, exercising or building your own thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A positive externality of good energy is that it gives a boost to the people around you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should manage energy as budgets in a company, seeking to maximize lo#ng term growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="matching-mental-state-to-activity">Matching mental state to activity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You should match your mood and energy levels to the activity, for instance creative tasks at the beginning of the day or exercise at noon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="simplifiers-va-optimizers">Simplifiers va optimizers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Simplifiers look for the easy Pareto solution although knowing that extra effor would lead to better outcomes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Optimizers aim for the best solution although it may increase the odds of failure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Simplification is usually the right answer when you need communication with others. Optimizing might be worth when you so things on your own or with a closed partner &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Humans are bad at good at following simple systems and these are also less subject to unexpected failures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simple systems are probably the best way to achieve success. Once you have success, optimizing begins to have more value.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Simplification frees up energy and time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="tidyness">Tidyness&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If your work space is a mess it distracts you and steals your energy. Tidy up for an energy boost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="knowledge-and-the-lack-thereof">Knowledge and the lack thereof&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A big energy killer Is the fear that you do not know how to do something your job would require.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To avoid this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ask questions and you usually find simple solution or cheap professionals that do it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Flash research in Google to check out are the stuff that worries you so much&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="dont-be-an-asshole">Don&amp;rsquo;t be an asshole&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Being an asshole causes energy drains all around and it might involve spending energy cleaning up the mess you made.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="priorities">Priorities&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>You. Health&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Economics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Family, friends, lovers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Local community, country, world&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Keep your priorities straight by judging how options affect your personal energy&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="managing-your-attitude">Managing your attitude&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>You can manipulate your thoughts to manage your attitude.
Buttons: Exercise, food, sleep. Avoid depressing news.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fake smiles, daydreaming fake it till you make it. Acting confident makes you feel confident. Feeling energetic makes you feel like playing a sport Playing a sport makes you feel energetic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Success at anything has a spillover effect on other things. Once you become good at unimportant things such as hobbies or sports, you are more prepared to be successful in more important challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should manipulate your perceptions to whatever makes you happy, because you are probably wrong about the nature of reality anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="my-speaking-career">My speaking career&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Asked for a price for giving a speech that he did not want to give he asked for 5k.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The speaking requests flowed in as he entered the speaking circuit after overpricing himself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="recognizing-your-talents-and-knowing-when-to-quit">Recognizing your talents and knowing when to quit&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>You can achieve something extraordinary by combining ordinary talents (vs gifted extraordinary innate world class talent)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can recognise your talents by:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Checking what you did obsessively as a kid&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tolerance for risk. We accept high risk when we expect high returns.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A system to achieve success involves trying lots of different things (sampling). This contradicts the general wisdom of sticking to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How you can tell when to quit? Things that work out started out well.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>small successes can grow into big ones, but failures rarely grow into successes&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Successes have X factor, meaning that you should focus if a segment of the audience is enthusiastic about it, instead of focusing in average responses. X factor can be detected by what users do with your product, instead of what they are saying.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="is-practicing-your-thing">Is practicing your thing?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Some people enter in flow mode when they are practicing (endless repetition) while for others this is hell on earth. The latter usually prefer gaining experience on a variety of functions or knowledge.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="managing-your-odds-for-success">Managing your odds for success&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Success formil: Every skill you acquire doubles your odds of success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good + Good &amp;gt; Excellent&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The power of leveraging multiple mediocre skills and also because everytime you learn a new skill it makes learning new skills easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>The more you know the more you can know.&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reading newspapers to broaden you exposure to new topics which rewires your brains and provides with energy boosts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-math-of-success">The math of success&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>You can&amp;rsquo;t control luck. But you can move from a game with low odds of success to a game with odds more favourable to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>List of skills that every adult should have working knowledge:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="public-speaking">Public speaking&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Took a Dale Carnegie public speaking class.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When I am on stage, it is a good day for me, I am the happiest person in the room. The audience only gets to listen, I get to speak, to feel, to be fully alive. I will absorb their energy and turn into something good.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The transformative power of praise versus the corrosive impact of criticism.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="psychology">Psychology&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is important to understand how the brain perceives the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Salespeople know that you can manipulate buyers by controlling what they compare.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Quality is not an independent force of the universe, it depends on what you choose as your frame of reference.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It includes a large list of cognitive biases and mental models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to succeed do more of what works and less of what doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People do not usually use reason for their big decisions in life. Do not think of people as rational beings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He suggests that we need to embrace psychology and try to be lifelong learners.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="business-writing">Business writing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Get a course. Get rid of unnecessary words and passive voice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="accounting">Accounting&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Cash flow projections, spreadsheet, time value of money.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="design">Design&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can learn rules and tricks of design to be effective in designing PowerPoints, flyers or whatsoever.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="conversation">Conversation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Reasons to have a conversation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Exchange information&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plan&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Complain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Entertain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Feel connected&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Befriend&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seduce&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Persuade&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be polite&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid awkward silence&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brag&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>How to make a conversation with strangers:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ask questions till you find a mutual interest:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What&amp;rsquo;s your name?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Where do you live?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do you have a family?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What do you do for a living?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do you have any hobbies/sports?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do you have any travel plans?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t complain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t talk about boring experiences&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t dominate the conversation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t get stuck on a topic. Keep moving&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Planning is useful but it is not a conversation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep the sas stories short&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The six questions might make you feel awkward but people love talking about themselves and it is very easy for everyone. You work as a conversationalist is to keep asking questions till you find what you have in common with the stranger. The point is to make the other person feel good.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="how-to-become-a-master-of-short-but-interesting-stories">How to become a master of short but interesting stories?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Or how to translate interesting experience into story form. Good storytelling needs preparation, and that means following a structure:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Setup: keep it brief, one sentence or two.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pattern: establish a pattern your story will violate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Foreshadowing: you leave clues where the story is going&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The characters: fill the story with personality traits&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Relatability: pick story topics your listeners will relate to&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The waist: no plot twist, no story.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Topics to avoid
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Food&lt;/li>
&lt;li>TV plots&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dreams&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Medical stories&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="overcoming-shyness">Overcoming shyness&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One technique involves imagining you are acting instead of interacting. A shy person can act like someone else more easily than acting like himself. Fake it till you make it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another technique is acting interested in other people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also try to classify people in two classes: thing people (love talking about tech, politics, tools and possessions, processes and systems) and people people (love talking about people doing interesting things), they get easily bored about thing topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Learn from outgoing people by observing them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="second-language">Second language&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Learn a second language.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="golf">Golf&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Not for business but for bonding with other males. It is also vacation for the mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="proper-grammar">Proper grammar&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You don&amp;rsquo;t want to sound like a moron/hillbilly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="persuasion">Persuasion&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You always have to try to convince people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Really enjoyed the take on this (p 135)
Useful expressions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Because&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Would you mind&amp;hellip;?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m not interested&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I don&amp;rsquo;t do that&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I have a rule
I just wanted to clarify
Is there anything you can do for me?
Thank you
This is just between you and me&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When situations are uncertain and complicated they look for leadership and decisiveness sometimes looks like leadership. So if you deliver decisiveness some people will picture you as a leader.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also persuade others by sharing your enthusiasm.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="technology">Technology&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You should have basic understanding of tech for working at startups, conversations and self preservation&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="proper-voice-technique">Proper voice technique&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You need breath control (from the belly button, not chest), tone (deep low tones) and mouth strategies. Posture is also important.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The seven habits of highly effective people by Stephen Covey:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Be proactive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Begin with the end in mind&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put first things first&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Think win-win&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seek first to understand then be understood&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Synergize&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sharpen the saw&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>And Adams add:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lack of fear of embarrassment: Bravery&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Education&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Exercise: physical exercise brings energy, creativity, bravery&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="humor">Humor&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Humor makes you look more attractive and confident. It also helps you out life in perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In-person humor requires effort but it does not demand too high quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Avoid humor traps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Overcomplaining&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t overdo the selfdeprecaition&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t mock people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid puns and wordplay&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="affirmations">Affirmations&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Affirmations consist of repeating what you want to achieve while you imagine it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I, Pelay Arbues, will become a&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is not magical thinking, it is about increasing focus.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="timing-is-luck-too">Timing is luck too&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Timing is the greatest form of luck. You have to synchronise with the universe. You can increase the odds by working hard, but it still works that way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="experts">Experts&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>They are right 98% of the time on the easy stuff and 50% on complicated, rare or misterious stuff&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="association-programming">Association programming&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Knew a guy that thought that he could became rich if he was surrounded by rich people. It might make sense because you learn by example, your energy might be boosted by seeing your goal live and direct.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People surrounded by overweight people is more prone to gain weight.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="happiness">Happiness&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Goal in life: maximize lifetime experience of happiness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Science of happiness: happiness isn&amp;rsquo;t as dependent of your circumstances as you may think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can get 80% of happiness by manipulating your body chemistry. Tips:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Being able to do what you want, &lt;em>when&lt;/em> you want. The timing can be more important than the things. A mediocre meal when you are starving &amp;gt; delicious meal when you are not hungry. A flexible schedule might make you really happy, so work towards flexible schedule.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Happiness is more related to the direction of the vector than the position of the point. You feel happy when things move in the right direction and bad when they has a downward trend. Sports provide you a feeling of progress.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Imagining a brighter future also brings joy. Recall the daydreaming chapter.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Bad mood is usually the result of good food, sleeping, exercise, imagination , flexible schedule and routine.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="diet">Diet&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Diet that works: eat as much as you want, of anything you want, whenever you want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your food preferences change thoroughout your life and you can deliberately change your preferences. Cravings can be manipulated. You can erase and gro cravings for unhealthy and healthy food.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="food-is-mood">Food is mood&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to change perception of healthy food you need you need to look at things differently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think of yourself as a programmable robot. Eating right makes you less vulnerable to the bumps of life.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="look-for-the-pattern">look for the pattern&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Test the &lt;em>food is mood&lt;/em> claim by testing it and observing your mood depending on your recent meals. Which meals make you feel energetic Vs sleepy?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-food-exercise-connection">The food-exercise connection&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Food is the fuel that makes exercise possible because it can turn your lazy mood to energetic.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="breaking-the-simple-carb-addiction">Breaking the simple carb addiction&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In order to reduce the willpower necessary to avoid simple carbs (white rice, bread, potatoes). The system is to break addiction to simple carbs and you can do it by eating as much as you want from other meals.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-to-know-what-to-eat">how to know what to eat&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Nutrition science is full of bullshit and very incomplete.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="how-to-make-healthy-food-taste-good">how to make healthy food taste good&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Avoid healthy but boring and awful food. Eating that requires too much willpower and it is unsustainable.
Experiment with veggies and:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;li>Salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cheese&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Soy sauce&lt;/li>

&lt;p>If you are active everyday, all other physical exercise will require much less willpower. And no willpower requirements is essential for the system to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The system is being active everyday, and all forms of exercise will do: take a walk, play basketball, clean garage&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Practical ways to schedule exercise:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Join an organised team&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Be active everyday and avoid setting specific days for exercise. Rest days break the habit.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rewards">Rewards&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Healthy snack, read articles on the phone or a cup of coffee.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>El libro comienza con la historia de Alejandro Magno enfrentándose a cómo tomar una fortaleza enclavada entre dos altos picos totalmente inexpugnable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>La historia cuenta que se reúne al equipo de sabios de distintos perfiles (team problem solving) y reformulan el problema. Lo reenfocan diciendo que el problema es cómo ganar una posición ventajosa en altura en los picos más elevados. Lo resuelven inventando la escalada en cordada y haciendo que suban arqueros que matan a los guardas y el gobernador rinde la fortaleza.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pasos que toman:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Definen el contexto de la situación&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Identificar soluciones fallidas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Imaginar escenario ideal de éxito &amp;gt; Redefinen el problema. De conquistar la fortaleza a conquistar la cima&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Definido el problema de llegar a la cima inventan solución&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Para ello parten de la solución ideal y fraccionan el problema en subclases que van resolviendo hasta crear solución total.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>La lógica estratégica desarrolla modelos de intervención basados en el objetivo a alcanzar de manera sistemática, no son destellos de un genio.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Karl Popper y el proceso de investigación científica:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Surge un problema&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Se estudian intentos de solución que se han llevado a cabo&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Se buscan soluciones alternativas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Se aplican&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Se evalúan efectos&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Se ajusta estrategia hasta hacerla eficaz&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>El problema solving es la tecnología para encontrar soluciones mientras que la ciencia busca dar explicaciones a los fenómenos que estudia. Es por tanto un saber operativo (como el conocimiento lógico o el tecnologíco) vs el saber especulativo (filosófico o el científico).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>El problem solver debe usar el conocimiento lógico tecnología operativo para sus intervenciones aunque obviamente éstos se retroalimentan con el filosófico/científico.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ante un problema tendemos a buscar la explicación más que la solución.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>La solución no tiene necesidad de la explicación previa del problema. Necesario orientarse a la solución problema presente en lugar de buscar la explicación en el pasado.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>El estudio de las causas pasadas es contraproducente para la búsqueda de soluciones presentes. Se refiere a no perderse en los porqué y entender cómo funciona.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Mediante el uso de las 5 preguntas. En qué consiste, quién está implicado, dónde se produce, cuando y cómo funciona.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Buscar distintas perspectivas para definirlo para evitar caer en los sesgos propios.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Para descubrir la solución es necesaria la redefinición repetitiva de las carácteristicas del problema. Otra forma de entender esta fase es buscar un reductor de la complejidad, redefinir el problema como hizo Alejandro Magno.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="determinar-y-acordar-el-objetivo">Determinar y acordar el objetivo&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Concretar un objetivo con los clientes para que la intervención pueda evaluarse como exitosa.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>En caso de hacerlo en equipo sirve para hacer copartícipes del proyecto y hacer team building.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="evaluar-las-soluciones-intentadas">Evaluar las soluciones intentadas&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Identificación y evaluación de los intentos fallidos nos libera de la tendencia de buscar soluciones sin haber investigado lo que no funciona. Este análisis nos puede mostrar que dinámicas perpetúan y mantienen el problema y cuáles lo pueden cambiar. Es decir permiten conocer el funcionamiento del problema.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Evaluar las estrategias intentadas supone:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Identificar lo que no funciona&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Identificar lo que funciona&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Si lo que funciona es reproducible ya tendremos una solución. Sin embargo es habitual que soluciones pasadas no funcionen en el presente.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="la-técnica-del-cómo-empeorar">La técnica del cómo empeorar&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Resulta de responder: &lt;code>si quisiera empeorar la situación cómo lo haría?&lt;/code> La mente al evaluar las soluciones fallidas busca, por contraste, soluciones alternativas. Es paradójico, pero esta estrategia desbloquea la creatividad al bloquear la atención racional en la generación de soluciones para fallar.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="la-técnica-del-escenario-más-allá-del-prroblema">La técnica del escenario más allá del prroblema&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Todo gran viaje comienza por un primer paso. Empezar por un pequeño cambio inicia un movimiento que además evita la resistencia al cambio que existe en cualquier sistema que está en un equilibrio desde hace tiempo.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;code>la enseñanza como una forma velada de introducción al cambio, especialmente útil cuando se trabaja con un grupo de personas de una misma organización pero que tienen ideas diferentes.&lt;/code>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Taylor was a gifted privileged kid, probe to optimise things since childhood and that later stated that 6 months working at a factory at age of 17 was the best education experience he ever had.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He realised that every worker has its own way to do things and soon realised that there must be &amp;ldquo;one best way&amp;rdquo;. This is the seed oh his theory, scientific management. In order to find it out he setup experiments aimed at not working harder but more productively.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Appreciating the magnitude of what one does not know is one of the main topics of this book&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h1 id="from-complicated-to-complex">From complicated to complex&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Technological development has flavoured our abilities to track, measure and communicate but it has also increased complexity making world less predictable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Complex systems are those densely interconnected and that interact so frequently that they are really hard to untangle. In addition, those dense interactions cause nonlinear change in the system. An event is unpredictable because it is the result of many causes linked by direct and indirect paths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Complex systems are fickle and volatile.
Complex systems: Weather (the butterfly effect by Lorenz), national economies&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Complicated problems have many parts but they can be broken down in a series of deterministic relationships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Warren Beaver seminal paper &amp;ldquo;Science and complexity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hayek comments on impossibility to reduce National economies to mechanical systems as markets are the result of decisions of millions of people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One strategy to solve complicated problems is breaking the process down into components.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A key difference between complicated and complex is the possibility of predicting the outcome within a time span (ex. Weather in a day, in a year)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Big data provides great insights to gain knowledge on the drivers of complex systems but it does not really improve the long term forecasts. For instance we may know how a Covid outbreak started but it is really difficult to where the next one is occurring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>==Decentralisation with coherence==&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In complex environments resilience is key factor for succes. Command and control strategies are usually counterproductive. Instead the strategy should be focus on building resilience. Anti fragile systems benefit from shocks Vs fragile systems that suffer great damage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an uncontrolled quest for optimization we can confront the ugly truth of reducing the resilience of the system. For instance, Zillow instant buyer disregard the trope &amp;quot; know that we don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Robustness is about strengthening components of the system. Resilience is about linking them in a way that allows them to reconfigure in response to change.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Efficiency is doing things right, effectiveness is doing the right things. Peter Drucker&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Rules and limitations that prevents accidents, limit creativity. And sometimes attachment to procedure makes you lose track of what matters (purpose).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Breaking vertical silos was the first step to create a true network of teams that shared information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Great teams bonds are built on the trust between members. This trust creates dense connectivity in the team, allowing them to quickly adayto changing environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In simple work environment, workers only need to know what the of their position is. In complex environments, it is important that the team is contextual aware of the overall picture and company strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MECE (Mutually Exclusive and Collectively exhaustive) covers all the scope without redundancy. Overlapping functions are inefficient but provides context and flexibility to the team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Breaking silos between teams by increasing its connectivity, specially in the fault lines (spaces between teams).&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="command-of-teams">Command of teams&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>How to scale the adaptability of teams across entire organization? How to ensure coordination within the superstructure by increasing trust and purpose without creating chaos?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Robin Dunbar: number of people we can trust, from 100 to 230. Malcolm Gladwell &amp;ldquo;Rule of 150&amp;rdquo; in his book Outliers. These figures might indicate why the goal of a team might not overlap to the goal of the superstructure it serves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a team grows the number of links to be managed increases exponentially. Team dynamics are delicate and adding new members puts them to test. See the book Leading Teams by Richard Hackman&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="team-of-teams">Team of teams&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Creating meaningful connections in a large organisation as those existing among team members is not easy task.the key is representation. ==You need everyone to know someone on every team.==&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lack of information sharing between teams causes breakdowns. These breakdowns are not of not of components but of the integration between them (==&amp;ldquo;interface failures&amp;rdquo;==)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NASA Apollo program managerial foundation by George Mueller. Joint cognition like a nervous system. Forced managers and engineers to communicate daily with their functional counterparts in other teams. Daily analysis and quick data exchange via a central control group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Contractors in house along with the resident engineers embraced and understood the Apollo project in its integrity. Systems thinking proposes that one cannot understand part of a system without a rudimentary understanding of the whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NASAS managerial system showed that in a domain with great intercependence and uncertainty, contextual understanding is key. Silos provide efficiency gains but interface failures increase costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="systems-thinking">Systems thinking&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Education Vs training. Education requires understanding, which allows us to face almost any problem. Training is focused on singular topics that might only be useful for particular issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People cooperate if they can see the interdependent nature of the environment. That requires having insights on how other teams work and how all pieces fit together by incorporating a knowledge pool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each team needs to have an overall understanding of the environment while keeping its own set of capabilities. &amp;ldquo;Generalized awareness and specialized expertise&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The role of physical arrangement of teams at offices is undeniable. Open plans foster spontaneous interaction and knowledge sharing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the quest of shared consciousness they increased information sharing and changed the briefing processes between juniors and seniors showing newbies how a problem is tackled in real time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cultural barriers and each team&amp;rsquo;s own narrow perspective posed the main challenges for shared consciousness. This meant creating relationships instead of just seeing other teams as separate forces that get and give.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Embedding program, a team member spend sometime inside other team to learn how to see war from the other team perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Liaisons, or interfaces, were intermediate roles that connected teams. Liaison members needed to be provided by deep support by the central team in order to be of value for their hosts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GM was a mess in terms of management, chaotic and lacking coordination and transversal organizer. Alfred Sloan changed the situation by introducing &amp;ldquo;decentralised operations and coordinated control&amp;rdquo;. What we call today as silos, hierarchical command and control structure. This led to great market share gains from 1920 to 1960 but in the 70s it&amp;rsquo;s lac of flexibility to adapt cars to customers chanfi go tasted caused serios troubles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ford approach, &amp;ldquo;working together&amp;rdquo; brought by ex responsible of Boeing 777,Mullaly. Ensured systematic transparency and forced interaction (live update 3D model of boeing that could be consulted by any engineer). Integrated designers and engineers as japanese used to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Working together always works. It always works. They have to be interdependent with one another. - Mullalya&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h1 id="breaking-silos">Breaking silos&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Embracing intercependence. Horizontal collaboration foster enterprise effectiveness. Collective intelligence depends on the connection among individuals and the 2 major drivers of idea flow are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Engagement within a team&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Exploration, frequent contact with other units.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In order to replace the old silo based system by shared consciousness system two things are needed:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Participatory transparency: holistic awareness&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Internal connectivity across teams: embedding and liason programs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="hands-off">Hands off&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Although managers love to take final decisions, sometimes they trust their teams so much that most of the time they just follow recommendations by team leaders. In that case, manager&amp;rsquo;s approval only adds delay to the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although communication flowed freely among teams and many people knew how to &amp;ldquo;do the right thing&amp;rdquo;, decision taking was slow. Avoid the team to ask for permission for routine task. In that case the leader must state clearly thoughts and philosophy on those situations so the team can make the call independently. &lt;code>cost of delay &amp;lt; cost of errors caused by removing supervisor&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Empowerment generates intrinsic task motivation. On the other hand micromanagement costs are higher than ever as the interdependence of issues makes lots of situations unpredictable, thus causing heavy deviation from plans. In those situations, empowered teams are the more agile response.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Empowerment is achieved by delegating decisions on the team and publicly rewarding their initiative. Even when failing. A necessary condition for empowerment to work is contextual understanding.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the old model, subordinates provide information and leaders disseminated commands. We reversed it: we had our leaders provide information so that subordinates armed with context, understanding and connectivity, could take initiative and make decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h1 id="from-chess-master-to-gardener">From chess master to gardener&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The chess player commands the different pieces following a strategy. The pieces don&amp;rsquo;t have a general overview of the chessboard, only the master has the necessary context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A gardener creates the necessary environment to vegetables to grow, but it cannot directly command the growing. Itgst context the main responsibility involves maintaining the teamwork conditions needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nothing is heard until is said several times. Only when you hear your own words echoed by subordinates you can be certain the message has been delivered.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>perhaps an organisation sells widgets and the leader finds thar she loves everything about widgets -designing, building and marketing then; that&amp;rsquo;s still not where the leader is most needed. The leader first responsible is to the whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Empowered execution requires shared consciousness. Empowering people without context leads to havoc.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Note taking is not just about collecting and aggregating thoughts but about making connections and sparkling new ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A well conceived working progress requires that used tools and techniques fit together.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-slip-box">The slip box&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is composed by:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Bibliographic notes: Sketchy notes on the reading&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Permanent notes: A note describing just an idea and linking to other notes (bibliographic or permanent)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Index of entry point notes: Topics arise from entry point notes linking to other notes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="how-to-write-a-paper">How to write a paper&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In order to write a paper you need:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Assemble notes putting arguments and put them into order&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write a draft&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Review it and correct it&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The main work here is not taking notes but thinking, reading and coming up with new ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-by-step">Step by step&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Fleeting notes. Sketch ideas, reminders of what is in your head. Put them in the inbox and process them later. If idea is already mature, go directly to write a permanent note in the slip box.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Literature notes. When reading, watching videos or podcast write down what catches your attention and might be reusable. &lt;strong>Write it with your own words&lt;/strong>. Keep the notes in the reference system.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Permanent notes. Go to the slip-box and process notes taken in step 1 and 2. Write a new idea that comes into your mind. **One idea, one note ** write in a clear concise way but it must be self contained disclosing references and sources. Discard fleeting notes and move literature notes to reference system.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add permanent notes to slip box. Add links to related notes, link the notes in a MoC or index.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Develop your topics by exploring the slip box, search for clusters of ideas, contradictions and find arguments that need further research and exploration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At this point there should be enough ideas to decide the topic to write about. Look through connections and collect relevant notes. Look for missing and redundant information. Go back to reading and develop new ideas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write a rough draft. Translate the notes into a coherent text. Detect holes in the argument, fill them or change the argument.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Edit and submit the paper.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In the process you will find many accidental ideas that you were not expecting to find when you started. Don&amp;rsquo;t waste this ideas because they do not fit the topic you are currently working on. Instead save them, process them and generate new ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-4-underlying-principles">The 4 underlying principles&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="writing-is-the-only-thing-that-matters">Writing is the only thing that matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;code> Working as if nothing else counts than writing&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Taking notes involves more focused reading, as you cannot write everything down and you always rephrase the contents in your own words (pushing you to understand the core ideas).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By doing everything with the purpose of writing means that you do it deliberately.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="simplicity-is-paramount">Simplicity is paramount&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The slip box is not arranged by topics, but it is simoky linked so that instead of forcing you to remember where you store them you focus on finding forgotten ideas and creating new ones&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to work we need a critical mass of notes and distinguish between 3 kind of notes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fleeting notes: remainders of information, it can be thrown away once processed. Capture ideas while you are doing something else&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Permanent notes: self-explanatory and fully understandable without more context. They are not reminders of thoughts or ideas, but the actual thought.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Project notes: relevant only for one project, might be archived once the project is done.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A typical mistake in note taking workflow is considering all notes as permanent. Good ideas are diluted among irrelevant information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other problem is to only take project related notes. You can&amp;rsquo;t restrict your thinking to a narrow project, instead new information and ideas on other topics will emerge while researching. It is tempting to try to open new projects to dump these new ideas, but in that case you end up with a lot of unfinished projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the case of treating all notes as fleeting ones, what follows is chaos and the need to clean up and start all over again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="nobody-ever-starts-from-scratch">Nobody ever starts from scratch&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Usually scientific workflows follow this structure:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Choose a topic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>plan research&lt;/li>
&lt;li>do research&lt;/li>
&lt;li>write&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Truth is that writing is not that linear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to do the first step, choose a topic, you should have already read and thought about a bunch of topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most how to guides rely heavily on brainstorming, because it is the only thing left when you have not been taken proper notes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finding a topic it is just follow the threads in the slip box, while it is a frustrating experience when you have not been writing while studying.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="let-the-work-carry-you-be-forward">Let the work carry you be forward&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you are working in flow mode, the own work generates momentum to keep on working. For that to happen, the workflow must be rewarding so that the dynamics of work and reward yield a feedback loop that motivates you to keep on working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[[Growth mindset]]: seek and welcome feedback. Means finding pleasure out of changing for the better instead of receiving praise. Being praised for what you are, instead of what you do might lead you to have a fixed mindset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Taking notes is a form of increasing the frequency of feedback. Instead of waiting for a paper review we obtain feedback on our notes as writing them test our understanding and our hability to explain them concisely. Reviewing our notes to take permanent notes, means realizing that we do not fully understand an idea and hence we can work on it. This leads to better writing, faster note taking and deeper reading.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="1-separate-and-interlocking-tasks">1. Separate and interlocking tasks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Attention deficit caused by multitasking and information overload lowers productivity. You can not get better at multitasking as no one is able to focus on more than one thing at a time. Instead what we do is to switch focus really fast what in the end drains our attention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here we are talking about sustained attention, no Mt about focus attention or flow ( a state of highly focused and effortless attention)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An organised workflow might improve our sustained attention by separating tasks and pushing us to focus on one thing for longer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Writing also involves very different tasks such as proof reading, acting as a external reviewer and writing itself. Other tasks are developing thoughts, outlining. The same happens with reading, some texts need our full attention while others might be skimmed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Successful problem solving, as it is done by eminent scholars, involves deep focus spans of time and flexible playful moments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides attention, we must also take into account the importance of writing on order to free up our short term memory. It has been demonstrated that we can only hold 7+-2 things at a time in our head, that&amp;rsquo;s why it is so important to dump our thoughts to a system that takes removes the need to keep in mind what we were thinking or doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Zeigarnik effect: open tasks are a burden for our short term memory till they are done. Done or written down. We can trick our brains so that they no longer worry about that task.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides attention, and short term memory there is a third scarce recourse: motivation or willpower. Ego depletion refers to a drain of willpower caused by prior use of volition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Standardised working environment reduces cognitive load (see [[pelayoarbues/02.Reference-System/_Notes/Team Cognitive Load]]) which reduces willpower to a lesser extent .&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2-read-for-understanding">2. Read for understanding&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Reading with pen and paper is the way to translate other people&amp;rsquo;s ideas into our own coherent thought. This is quite different than copying and pastin, since even using the same expression as the author they will be less meaningful than our own words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After finishing the book, go through the notes and see if you can relate them with any note at the slip box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Confirmation bias is one of the major flaws of human reasoning. Slip box allows us to gather facts and ideas that connect with other thoughts independently if they are addition or contradictions. The only thing that matters is that if it&amp;rsquo;s relevant or irrelevant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Re-reading, cramming and re-reviewring are not effective for learning, just for passing the test. A much more successful learning method is elaboration (thinking about the meaning of what we read, how it can inform different topics and and linking to other topics).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="3-take-smart-notes">3. Take Smart notes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Effective reading means being able to read a text linkinh it to other topics and find missing arguments. A common problem of inexperienced readers is that the stick to the frame where the tamezt lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Writing can be thought as an external arena where the true process of thinking occurs. It allows us to see our thoughts in perspective which is exactly what we need to keep them as rational as possible and far from the reach of brains shortcuts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can measure memory capabilities in terms of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Storage strength: ability to store memories&lt;/li>
&lt;li>retrieval strength: ability to build connections between memories&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="4develop-ideas">4.Develop ideas&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The slip box is where our thinking occurs. It is then impossible to keep it constrained inside artificial boundaries. That is why there are no categories for the permanent notes, but connections with other thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to develop topics we might use an index that links to notes via tags, but what it is more important is the links between notes so that we enter into the realm of surprise and concrete thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another way is to create a note that overviews a topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to choose a keyword we should think as writers instead of archivists, and look for in which circumstances we want to come across with this thought. Keywords should be chosen while keeping an eye on the topics we are interested to develop, not in isolation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Types of cross references:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>links in notes reviewing a topic.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>note-to-note links&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The process of linking notes is a core point of thinking. And leaning on the slip box, as an external source of ideas, we are less prone to imagine connections where there aren&amp;rsquo;t any.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working with the slip box is sometimes disillusioning as weay think that one idea we are excited about is ours and novel and when we check the slip box might be already there (we have forgot about it) and it may not be ours. This is not only bad news as we may usually confront ideas or find subtle but interesting differences between them, sparking new discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Build a lattice of mental models to get a grip on reality. Charlie Munger&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Creativity and generation of new ideas depends more on breaking old habits of thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Structure and restrictions, although it sounds counterintuitive, are a source of scientific progress and creativity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="share-your-insight">Share your insight&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The slip box allows us to easily find a topic to write about. This is because our own motivations are already there: in each note we take, in every literature note we write, we are saving those thoughts that are more important to us. ==It is evolution applied to ideas and thoughts.==&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Truly understanding something means that we can spot it&amp;rsquo;s limitations. That is the reason why are more open to new ideas the more familiar we are with certain thoughts. You may just fall in love with a particular idea that you are somewhat familiar with. But once you go deeper, find new perspectives on the topic and think on its drawbacks you might be able to find something that becomes a breakthrough innovation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Work on different manuscripts at the same time. That prevents you from blockages and also takes advantage of by-products generated by each project which might generate new projects which generate more by-products and so on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Zeigarnik effect. Our brains are occupied with a task till it is accomplished or written down. Every long work fills the time we set aside for it while short tasks are often speed up. It is important to get started and do it with feasible tasks (take a note is much better than working on vague and I&amp;rsquo;ll defined task such as keep working an overdue paper)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the hardest parts of reviewing a draft is to get rid (cut) some parts. For this purpose it is a good practice to cut the sentences and paragraphs that don&amp;rsquo;t fit in the manuscript to other document in order to reuse them. Although you may never use them, it helps you psychologically to &amp;ldquo;kill your darlings&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Roadmap for Creating a Data Literacy Program</title><link>https://pelayoarbues.github.io/literature-notes/Articles/A-Roadmap-for-Creating-a-Data-Literacy-Program/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pelayoarbues.github.io/literature-notes/Articles/A-Roadmap-for-Creating-a-Data-Literacy-Program/</guid><description>&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">

&lt;h1 id="why">Why&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In order to become data driven we need to provide data and technology (supply) and also develop a scientist mindset in employees across the organization (demand side)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main hurdle to become data driven is not technology, it is people, processes and chttps://towardsdatascience.com/platform-products-for-machine-learning-3d3749443d2ulture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Extracting insights and value from data to solve business problems and identify oopportunities is not a responsability only for the data science team. Data literate users can embrace and leverage data across the organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what">What&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Success in data-driven culture and data science initiatives comes down to people. People = HR. The data literacy program is the bridge between data driven culture and business functions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data literacy goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Employees are able to critical think and analyse using data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make data-based decisions instead of intuition ones&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Communicate ideas relying on data to improve products or operations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understand data visualizations&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The skills needed by employees are critical and analytical thinking using data. In particular:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Data Concepts and applications: high level issues and challenges associated with data and data ethics and security&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data access and collection: Ability to access and find information in multiple data soruces. Employees should be able to find sources and understand how data has been collected in those assessing the trustworthiness of that data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data management: Ability to organize and make sense of multiple types of data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data relevancy: Be able to prioritize the use of data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data driven inquiry: Be able to identify business problems and pose the correct questions which might be answered using basic data analysis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data tools: Common data analysis tools and techniques&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data Communication: Employes should be able to read and produce communications with data. &lt;strong>Basics of data visualization&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Create data vision and roadmap
Identify areas of business where data is critical.
Management and HR communicate why data maters. This provides context to employees on why they need to upskill. C level support is a necessary condition for achieving a data driven company.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Data literacy vision
Vision must include desirable skills, abilities and level of data savviness for different business units.
Questions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do we need EVERYONE to have a data language understanding?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Certain roles in operations or strategic planning require a comparative analysis level of understanding?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Which roles has a higher priority in data literacy upskilling?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How data-driven we should be at different levels?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We need to build a framework to achieve data literacy goals, measure progress and move forward:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Decide skills required by whom&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to measure skills development&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Which decisions need to be data-driven&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Design a plan to achieve data literacy goals
Roll out to the entire organization or starting with a pilot?
Identify data evangelists, quickly upskill them and share results and iterate.
HR decide what formats are best and budgets and resources needed.
Decisions on access to data, automation tools and what level of data literacy they should have before providing access to tools and databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Assess workforce data skills
Workforces are highly diverse, important not to treat everyone the same.
Basic foundations needed by everyone, HR should determine how to assess baseline skills.
These assessments should start during hiring processs for new employees.
Skill mapping should also asses employee level of interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Assessment should be efficient and consistent&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Create individual and team data literacy learning development plans
HR identifies and tracks areas of improvement in data literacy education
Once HR and managers have identified gaps in data skills, HR construct learning programs
Include a program where to find data related to their role, governance rules, data ethics, tools used&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Create data literacy delivery modules
Delivery should be execute with different levels: from beginner, introductory to self-service data science.
Introductory courses should make sure everyone on the same page of data concepts, ethics and potential uses.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Aditional learning modules specific by business unit (People Analytics for HR, design with data).&lt;/p>

&lt;li>The voice comes braying in as soon as we open our eyes in the morning, and then heckles us all day long with an air horn. It’s a fever swamp of urges, desires, and judgments. It’s fixated on the past and the future, to the detriment of the here and now. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=68" rel="noopener">Location 68&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our entire lives, he argued, are governed by a voice in our heads. This voice is engaged in a ceaseless stream of thinking—most of it negative, repetitive, and self-referential. It squawks away at us from the minute we open our eyes in the morning until the minute we fall asleep at night, if it allows us to sleep at all. Talk, talk, talk: the voice is constantly judging and labeling everything in its field of vision. Its targets aren’t just external; it often viciously taunts us, too. (

&lt;li>The ego is never satisfied. No matter how much stuff we buy, no matter how many arguments we win or delicious meals we consume, the ego never feels complete. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=998" rel="noopener">Location 998&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The ego is constantly comparing itself to others. It has us measuring our self-worth against the looks, wealth, and social status of everyone else. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1000" rel="noopener">Location 1000&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The ego thrives on drama. It keeps our old resentments and grievances alive through compulsive thought. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1002" rel="noopener">Location 1002&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Perhaps the most powerful Tollean insight into the ego was that it is obsessed with the past and the future, at the expense of the present. We “live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation,” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1003" rel="noopener">Location 1003&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“When you have one foot in the future and the other in the past, you piss on the present.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1009" rel="noopener">Location 1009&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>in the deadline-dominated world of news, I was always hurtling headlong through the day, checking things off my to-do list, constantly picturing completion instead of calmly and carefully enjoying the process. The unspoken assumption behind most of my forward momentum was that whatever was coming next would definitely be better. Only when I reached that ineffable … whatever … would I be totally satisfied. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1010" rel="noopener">Location 1010&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Make the present moment your friend rather than your enemy. Because many people live habitually as if the present moment were an obstacle that they need to overcome in order to get to the next moment. And imagine living your whole life like that, where always this moment is never quite right, not good enough because you need to get to the next one. That is continuous stress.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1171" rel="noopener">Location 1171&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The route to true happiness, he argued, was to achieve a visceral understanding of impermanence, which would take you off the emotional roller coaster and allow you to see your dramas and desires through a wider lens. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1503" rel="noopener">Location 1503&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a nutshell, mindfulness is the ability to recognize what is happening in your mind right now—anger, jealousy, sadness, the pain of a stubbed toe, whatever—without getting carried away by it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1719" rel="noopener">Location 1719&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>According to the Buddha, we have three habitual responses to everything we experience. We want it, reject it, or we zone out. Cookies: I want. Mosquitoes: I reject. The safety instructions the flight attendants read aloud on an airplane: I zone out. Mindfulness is a fourth option, a way to view the contents of our mind with nonjudgmental remove. I found this theory elegant, but utterly unfeasible. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1721" rel="noopener">Location 1721&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our minds have this other capability—a bonus level, to put it in gamerspeak—that no one ever tells us about in school. (Not here in the West, at least.) We can do more than just think; we also have the power simply to be aware of things—without judgment, without the ego. This is not to denigrate thinking, just to say that thinking without awareness can be a harsh master. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1743" rel="noopener">Location 1743&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“People come to me a lot feeling like they ought to be loving themselves, and I actually counsel against it,” he said. His delivery was off-the-cuff and shtick-free. In stark contrast to Brach, he argued that we needed to actively get in touch with our ugly side. “Mindfulness gives us a way to examine our self-hatred without trying to make it go away, without trying to love it particularly.” Just being mindful of it, he said, could be “tremendously liberating.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1851" rel="noopener">Location 1851&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seeing a problem clearly does not prevent you from taking action, he explained. Acceptance is not passivity. Sometimes we are justifiably displeased. What mindfulness does is create some space in your head so you can, as the Buddhists say, “respond” rather than simply “react.” In the Buddhist view, you can’t control what comes up in your head; it all arises out of a mysterious void. We spend a lot of time judging ourselves harshly for feelings that we had no role in summoning. The only thing you can control is how you handle it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1909" rel="noopener">Location 1909&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He’s talking about a verse where the Buddha calls everything we experience—sights, sounds, smells, etc.—the “terrible bait of the world.” “It’s … an amazing statement,” he says. “Moment after moment, experiences are arising, and it’s as if each one has a hook … and we’re the fish. Do we bite? Or do we not bite, and just swim freely in the ocean?” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=2173" rel="noopener">Location 2173&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After an initial period of “how dare he” indignation over Jim Murphy telling me I was never going to be a big-time anchorman, I decided to approach the problem in a Buddhist style: to lean into it, to take his views seriously, no matter how inconvenient they may have been—to respond, rather than react. (

&lt;li>This, as Joseph had pointed out on retreat, is the lie we tell ourselves our whole lives: as soon as we get the next meal, party, vacation, sexual encounter, as soon as we get married, get a promotion, get to the airport check-in, get through security and consume a bouquet of Auntie Anne’s Cinnamon Sugar Stix, we’ll feel really good. But as soon as we find ourselves in the airport gate area, having ingested 470 calories’ worth of sugar and fat before dinner, we (

&lt;li>“It’s not me telling you,” she said. “It’s neuroscience that would say that our capacity to multitask is virtually nonexistent. Multitasking is a computer-derived term. We have one processor. We can’t do it.” (

&lt;li>This problem was, of course, exacerbated in the age of what had been dubbed the “infoblitzkrieg,” where it took superhuman strength to ignore the siren call of the latest tweet, or the blinking red light on the BlackBerry. Scientists had even come up with a term for this condition: “continuous partial attention.” It was a syndrome with which I was intimately familiar, even after all my meditating. (

&lt;li>Another tip: take short mindfulness breaks throughout the day. She called them “purposeful pauses.” So, for example, instead of fidgeting or tapping your fingers while your computer boots up, try to watch your breath for a few minutes. (

&lt;li>I had long assumed that ceaseless planning was the recipe for effectiveness, but Marturano’s point was that too much mental churning was counterproductive. When you lurch from one thing to the next, constantly scheming, or reacting to incoming fire, the mind gets exhausted. You get sloppy and make bad decisions.

&lt;li>Studies showed that the best way to engineer an epiphany was to work hard, focus, research, and think about a problem—and then let go. Do something else. That didn’t necessarily mean meditate, but do something that relaxes and distracts you; let your unconscious mind go to work, making connections from disparate parts of the brain. (

&lt;li>there is a self-interested, or selfish, case for being compassionate?” “Yes. Practice of compassion is ultimately benefit to you. So I usually describe: we are selfish, but be wise selfish rather than foolish selfish.” (

&lt;li>if I was really interested in Buddhism, I should read his favorite book, by an ancient sage named Shantideva. (

&lt;li>Research also showed that everyone from the elderly to alcoholics to people living with AIDS patients saw their health improve if they did volunteer work. Overall, compassionate people tended to be healthier, happier, more popular, and more successful at work. (

&lt;li>had fallen, he said, into several classic “pitfalls of the path.” People often misinterpreted the dharma to mean they had to adopt a sort of meekness. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=3262" rel="noopener">Location 3262&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Another pitfall was detachment. I thought I was being mindful of my distress when I was left out of the big stories, but really I was just building a wall to keep out the things that made me angry or fearful. The final pitfall to which I’d succumbed was nihilism: an occasional sense of, “Whatever, man, everything’s impermanent.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=3266" rel="noopener">Location 3266&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Praise Allah, but also tie your camel to the post.” In other words, it’s good to take a transcendent view of the world, but don’t be a chump. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=3271" rel="noopener">Location 3271&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“The answer is in nonattachment,” he said. In my defense, the term was deceptively bland. “It’s nonattachment to the results. I think for an ambitious person who cares about their career—who wants to create things and be successful—it’s natural to be trying really hard. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=3347" rel="noopener">Location 3347&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I couldn’t quite figure out how you could work your tail off on something and then not be attached to the outcome. I had come up through a system that venerated bootstrapping and a fierce refusal to fail. Doing this without attachment didn’t seem to fit the paradigm. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=3351" rel="noopener">Location 3351&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>again. I said, “When we last spoke, you said it’s okay to be ambitious, but don’t be attached to the results. I cut you off, as I usually do—but what does that mean?” “It’s like, you write a book, you want it to be well received, you want it to be at the top of the bestsellers list, but you have limited control over what happens. You can hire a publicist, you can do every interview, you can be prepared, but you have very little control over the marketplace. So you put it out there without attachment, so it has its own life. Everything is like that.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=3354" rel="noopener">Location 3354&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Striving is fine, as long as it’s tempered by the realization that, in an entropic universe, the final outcome is out of your control. If you don’t waste your energy on variables you cannot influence, you can focus much more effectively on those you can. When you are wisely ambitious, you do everything you can to succeed, but you are not attached to the outcome—so that if you fail, you will be maximally resilient, able to get up, dust yourself off, and get back in the fray. That, to use a loaded term, is enlightened self-interest. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=3364" rel="noopener">Location 3364&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>didn’t need to waste so much time envisioning some vague horribleness awaiting me in my future. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=3373" rel="noopener">Location 3373&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All I had to do was tell myself: if it doesn’t work, I only need the grit to start again—just like when my mind wandered in meditation. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=3374" rel="noopener">Location 3374&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“nonattachment to results” was my long-sought Holy Grail, the middle path, the marriage of “the price of security” and “the wisdom of insecurity.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=3376" rel="noopener">Location 3376&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>compassion has the strategic benefit of winning you allies. (

&lt;li>Sometimes you need to compete aggressively, plead your own case, or even have a sharp word with someone. It’s not easy, but it’s possible to do this calmly and without making the whole thing overly personal. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=3401" rel="noopener">Location 3401&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation is the superpower that makes all the other precepts possible. The practice has countless benefits—from better health to increased focus to a deeper sense of calm—but the biggie is the ability to respond instead of react to your impulses and urges. We live our life propelled by desire and aversion. In meditation, instead of succumbing to these deeply rooted habits of mind, you are simply watching what comes up in your head nonjudgmentally. (

&lt;li>All successful people fail. If you can create an inner environment where your mistakes are forgiven and flaws are candidly confronted, your resilience expands exponentially. (

&lt;li>He explained that the brain is a pleasure-seeking machine. Once you teach it, through meditation, that abiding calmly in the present moment feels better than our habitual state of clinging, over time, the brain will want more and more mindfulness. He compared it to lab rats that learn to avoid an electric shock. (

&lt;li>If you give your brain enough of a taste of mindfulness, it will eventually create a self-reinforcing spiral—a retreat from greed and hatred that could, Jud insisted, potentially lead all the way to the definitive uprooting of negative emotions (in other words, enlightenment). (

&lt;li>The voice comes braying in as soon as we open our eyes in the morning, and then heckles us all day long with an air horn. It’s a fever swamp of urges, desires, and judgments. It’s fixated on the past and the future, to the detriment of the here and now. (

&lt;li>Our entire lives, he argued, are governed by a voice in our heads. This voice is engaged in a ceaseless stream of thinking—most of it negative, repetitive, and self-referential. It squawks away at us from the minute we open our eyes in the morning until the minute we fall asleep at night, if it allows us to sleep at all. Talk, talk, talk: the voice is constantly judging and labeling everything in its field of vision. Its targets aren’t just external; it often viciously taunts us, too. (

&lt;li>The ego is never satisfied. No matter how much stuff we buy, no matter how many arguments we win or delicious meals we consume, the ego never feels complete. (

&lt;li>The ego is constantly comparing itself to others. It has us measuring our self-worth against the looks, wealth, and social status of everyone else. (

&lt;li>The ego thrives on drama. It keeps our old resentments and grievances alive through compulsive thought. (

&lt;li>Perhaps the most powerful Tollean insight into the ego was that it is obsessed with the past and the future, at the expense of the present. We “live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation,” (

&lt;li>“When you have one foot in the future and the other in the past, you piss on the present.” (

&lt;li>in the deadline-dominated world of news, I was always hurtling headlong through the day, checking things off my to-do list, constantly picturing completion instead of calmly and carefully enjoying the process. The unspoken assumption behind most of my forward momentum was that whatever was coming next would definitely be better. Only when I reached that ineffable … whatever … would I be totally satisfied. (

&lt;li>“Make the present moment your friend rather than your enemy. Because many people live habitually as if the present moment were an obstacle that they need to overcome in order to get to the next moment. And imagine living your whole life like that, where always this moment is never quite right, not good enough because you need to get to the next one. That is continuous stress.” (

&lt;li>The route to true happiness, he argued, was to achieve a visceral understanding of impermanence, which would take you off the emotional roller coaster and allow you to see your dramas and desires through a wider lens. (

&lt;li>In a nutshell, mindfulness is the ability to recognize what is happening in your mind right now—anger, jealousy, sadness, the pain of a stubbed toe, whatever—without getting carried away by it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1719" rel="noopener">Location 1719&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>According to the Buddha, we have three habitual responses to everything we experience. We want it, reject it, or we zone out. Cookies: I want. Mosquitoes: I reject. The safety instructions the flight attendants read aloud on an airplane: I zone out. Mindfulness is a fourth option, a way to view the contents of our mind with nonjudgmental remove. I found this theory elegant, but utterly unfeasible. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1721" rel="noopener">Location 1721&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our minds have this other capability—a bonus level, to put it in gamerspeak—that no one ever tells us about in school. (Not here in the West, at least.) We can do more than just think; we also have the power simply to be aware of things—without judgment, without the ego. This is not to denigrate thinking, just to say that thinking without awareness can be a harsh master. (

&lt;li>“People come to me a lot feeling like they ought to be loving themselves, and I actually counsel against it,” he said. His delivery was off-the-cuff and shtick-free. In stark contrast to Brach, he argued that we needed to actively get in touch with our ugly side. “Mindfulness gives us a way to examine our self-hatred without trying to make it go away, without trying to love it particularly.” Just being mindful of it, he said, could be “tremendously liberating.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1851" rel="noopener">Location 1851&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seeing a problem clearly does not prevent you from taking action, he explained. Acceptance is not passivity. Sometimes we are justifiably displeased. What mindfulness does is create some space in your head so you can, as the Buddhists say, “respond” rather than simply “react.” In the Buddhist view, you can’t control what comes up in your head; it all arises out of a mysterious void. We spend a lot of time judging ourselves harshly for feelings that we had no role in summoning. The only thing you can control is how you handle it. (

&lt;li>He’s talking about a verse where the Buddha calls everything we experience—sights, sounds, smells, etc.—the “terrible bait of the world.” “It’s … an amazing statement,” he says. “Moment after moment, experiences are arising, and it’s as if each one has a hook … and we’re the fish. Do we bite? Or do we not bite, and just swim freely in the ocean?” (

&lt;li>After an initial period of “how dare he” indignation over Jim Murphy telling me I was never going to be a big-time anchorman, I decided to approach the problem in a Buddhist style: to lean into it, to take his views seriously, no matter how inconvenient they may have been—to respond, rather than react.

&lt;li>This, as Joseph had pointed out on retreat, is the lie we tell ourselves our whole lives: as soon as we get the next meal, party, vacation, sexual encounter, as soon as we get married, get a promotion, get to the airport check-in, get through security and consume a bouquet of Auntie Anne’s Cinnamon Sugar Stix, we’ll feel really good. But as soon as we find ourselves in the airport gate area, having ingested 470 calories’ worth of sugar and fat before dinner, we (

&lt;li>“The answer is in nonattachment,” he said. In my defense, the term was deceptively bland. “It’s nonattachment to the results. I think for an ambitious person who cares about their career—who wants to create things and be successful—it’s natural to be trying really hard. (

&lt;li>I couldn’t quite figure out how you could work your tail off on something and then not be attached to the outcome. I had come up through a system that venerated bootstrapping and a fierce refusal to fail. Doing this without attachment didn’t seem to fit the paradigm. (

&lt;li>again. I said, “When we last spoke, you said it’s okay to be ambitious, but don’t be attached to the results. I cut you off, as I usually do—but what does that mean?” “It’s like, you write a book, you want it to be well received, you want it to be at the top of the bestsellers list, but you have limited control over what happens. You can hire a publicist, you can do every interview, you can be prepared, but you have very little control over the marketplace. So you put it out there without attachment, so it has its own life. Everything is like that.” (

&lt;li>Striving is fine, as long as it’s tempered by the realization that, in an entropic universe, the final outcome is out of your control. If you don’t waste your energy on variables you cannot influence, you can focus much more effectively on those you can. When you are wisely ambitious, you do everything you can to succeed, but you are not attached to the outcome—so that if you fail, you will be maximally resilient, able to get up, dust yourself off, and get back in the fray. That, to use a loaded term, is enlightened self-interest. (

&lt;li>didn’t need to waste so much time envisioning some vague horribleness awaiting me in my future. (

&lt;li>All I had to do was tell myself: if it doesn’t work, I only need the grit to start again—just like when my mind wandered in meditation. (

&lt;li>“nonattachment to results” was my long-sought Holy Grail, the middle path, the marriage of “the price of security” and “the wisdom of insecurity.” (

&lt;li>compassion has the strategic benefit of winning you allies. (

&lt;li>Sometimes you need to compete aggressively, plead your own case, or even have a sharp word with someone. It’s not easy, but it’s possible to do this calmly and without making the whole thing overly personal. (

&lt;li>Meditation is the superpower that makes all the other precepts possible. The practice has countless benefits—from better health to increased focus to a deeper sense of calm—but the biggie is the ability to respond instead of react to your impulses and urges. We live our life propelled by desire and aversion. In meditation, instead of succumbing to these deeply rooted habits of mind, you are simply watching what comes up in your head nonjudgmentally. (

&lt;li>He explained that the brain is a pleasure-seeking machine. Once you teach it, through meditation, that abiding calmly in the present moment feels better than our habitual state of clinging, over time, the brain will want more and more mindfulness. He compared it to lab rats that learn to avoid an electric shock. (

&lt;li>If you give your brain enough of a taste of mindfulness, it will eventually create a self-reinforcing spiral—a retreat from greed and hatred that could, Jud insisted, potentially lead all the way to the definitive uprooting of negative emotions (in other words, enlightenment). (

&lt;li>The voice comes braying in as soon as we open our eyes in the morning, and then heckles us all day long with an air horn. It’s a fever swamp of urges, desires, and judgments. It’s fixated on the past and the future, to the detriment of the here and now. (

&lt;li>Our entire lives, he argued, are governed by a voice in our heads. This voice is engaged in a ceaseless stream of thinking—most of it negative, repetitive, and self-referential. It squawks away at us from the minute we open our eyes in the morning until the minute we fall asleep at night, if it allows us to sleep at all. Talk, talk, talk: the voice is constantly judging and labeling everything in its field of vision. Its targets aren’t just external; it often viciously taunts us, too. (

&lt;li>The ego is never satisfied. No matter how much stuff we buy, no matter how many arguments we win or delicious meals we consume, the ego never feels complete. (

&lt;li>The ego is constantly comparing itself to others. It has us measuring our self-worth against the looks, wealth, and social status of everyone else. (

&lt;li>The ego thrives on drama. It keeps our old resentments and grievances alive through compulsive thought. (

&lt;li>Perhaps the most powerful Tollean insight into the ego was that it is obsessed with the past and the future, at the expense of the present. We “live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation,” (

&lt;li>“When you have one foot in the future and the other in the past, you piss on the present.” (

&lt;li>in the deadline-dominated world of news, I was always hurtling headlong through the day, checking things off my to-do list, constantly picturing completion instead of calmly and carefully enjoying the process. The unspoken assumption behind most of my forward momentum was that whatever was coming next would definitely be better. Only when I reached that ineffable … whatever … would I be totally satisfied.

&lt;li>“Make the present moment your friend rather than your enemy. Because many people live habitually as if the present moment were an obstacle that they need to overcome in order to get to the next moment. And imagine living your whole life like that, where always this moment is never quite right, not good enough because you need to get to the next one. That is continuous stress.” (

&lt;li>The route to true happiness, he argued, was to achieve a visceral understanding of impermanence, which would take you off the emotional roller coaster and allow you to see your dramas and desires through a wider lens. (

&lt;li>In a nutshell, mindfulness is the ability to recognize what is happening in your mind right now—anger, jealousy, sadness, the pain of a stubbed toe, whatever—without getting carried away by it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1719" rel="noopener">Location 1719&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>According to the Buddha, we have three habitual responses to everything we experience. We want it, reject it, or we zone out. Cookies: I want. Mosquitoes: I reject. The safety instructions the flight attendants read aloud on an airplane: I zone out. Mindfulness is a fourth option, a way to view the contents of our mind with nonjudgmental remove. I found this theory elegant, but utterly unfeasible. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1721" rel="noopener">Location 1721&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our minds have this other capability—a bonus level, to put it in gamerspeak—that no one ever tells us about in school. (Not here in the West, at least.) We can do more than just think; we also have the power simply to be aware of things—without judgment, without the ego. This is not to denigrate thinking, just to say that thinking without awareness can be a harsh master. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1743" rel="noopener">Location 1743&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“People come to me a lot feeling like they ought to be loving themselves, and I actually counsel against it,” he said. His delivery was off-the-cuff and shtick-free. In stark contrast to Brach, he argued that we needed to actively get in touch with our ugly side. “Mindfulness gives us a way to examine our self-hatred without trying to make it go away, without trying to love it particularly.” Just being mindful of it, he said, could be “tremendously liberating.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1851" rel="noopener">Location 1851&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seeing a problem clearly does not prevent you from taking action, he explained. Acceptance is not passivity. Sometimes we are justifiably displeased. What mindfulness does is create some space in your head so you can, as the Buddhists say, “respond” rather than simply “react.” In the Buddhist view, you can’t control what comes up in your head; it all arises out of a mysterious void. We spend a lot of time judging ourselves harshly for feelings that we had no role in summoning. The only thing you can control is how you handle it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1909" rel="noopener">Location 1909&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He’s talking about a verse where the Buddha calls everything we experience—sights, sounds, smells, etc.—the “terrible bait of the world.” “It’s … an amazing statement,” he says. “Moment after moment, experiences are arising, and it’s as if each one has a hook … and we’re the fish. Do we bite? Or do we not bite, and just swim freely in the ocean?” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=2173" rel="noopener">Location 2173&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After an initial period of “how dare he” indignation over Jim Murphy telling me I was never going to be a big-time anchorman, I decided to approach the problem in a Buddhist style: to lean into it, to take his views seriously, no matter how inconvenient they may have been—to respond, rather than react.

&lt;li>This, as Joseph had pointed out on retreat, is the lie we tell ourselves our whole lives: as soon as we get the next meal, party, vacation, sexual encounter, as soon as we get married, get a promotion, get to the airport check-in, get through security and consume a bouquet of Auntie Anne’s Cinnamon Sugar Stix, we’ll feel really good. But as soon as we find ourselves in the airport gate area, having ingested 470 calories’ worth of sugar and fat before dinner, we (

&lt;li>“It’s not me telling you,” she said. “It’s neuroscience that would say that our capacity to multitask is virtually nonexistent. Multitasking is a computer-derived term. We have one processor. We can’t do it.” (

&lt;li>This problem was, of course, exacerbated in the age of what had been dubbed the “infoblitzkrieg,” where it took superhuman strength to ignore the siren call of the latest tweet, or the blinking red light on the BlackBerry. Scientists had even come up with a term for this condition: “continuous partial attention.” It was a syndrome with which I was intimately familiar, even after all my meditating. (

&lt;li>Another tip: take short mindfulness breaks throughout the day. She called them “purposeful pauses.” So, for example, instead of fidgeting or tapping your fingers while your computer boots up, try to watch your breath for a few minutes. (

&lt;li>I had long assumed that ceaseless planning was the recipe for effectiveness, but Marturano’s point was that too much mental churning was counterproductive. When you lurch from one thing to the next, constantly scheming, or reacting to incoming fire, the mind gets exhausted. You get sloppy and make bad decisions. I could see how the counterintuitive act of stopping, even for a few seconds, could be a source of strength, not weakness. This was a practical complement to Joseph’s “is this useful?” mantra. It was the opposite of zoning out, (

&lt;li>Studies showed that the best way to engineer an epiphany was to work hard, focus, research, and think about a problem—and then let go. Do something else. That didn’t necessarily mean meditate, but do something that relaxes and distracts you; let your unconscious mind go to work, making connections from disparate parts of the brain. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=2850" rel="noopener">Location 2850&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>there is a self-interested, or selfish, case for being compassionate?” “Yes. Practice of compassion is ultimately benefit to you. So I usually describe: we are selfish, but be wise selfish rather than foolish selfish.” (

&lt;li>if I was really interested in Buddhism, I should read his favorite book, by an ancient sage named Shantideva. (

&lt;li>Research also showed that everyone from the elderly to alcoholics to people living with AIDS patients saw their health improve if they did volunteer work. Overall, compassionate people tended to be healthier, happier, more popular, and more successful at work. (

&lt;li>had fallen, he said, into several classic “pitfalls of the path.” People often misinterpreted the dharma to mean they had to adopt a sort of meekness. (

&lt;li>Another pitfall was detachment. I thought I was being mindful of my distress when I was left out of the big stories, but really I was just building a wall to keep out the things that made me angry or fearful. The final pitfall to which I’d succumbed was nihilism: an occasional sense of, “Whatever, man, everything’s impermanent.” (

&lt;li>Meditation is the superpower that makes all the other precepts possible. The practice has countless benefits—from better health to increased focus to a deeper sense of calm—but the biggie is the ability to respond instead of react to your impulses and urges. We live our life propelled by desire and aversion. In meditation, instead of succumbing to these deeply rooted habits of mind, you are simply watching what comes up in your head nonjudgmentally. (

&lt;li>The voice comes braying in as soon as we open our eyes in the morning, and then heckles us all day long with an air horn. It’s a fever swamp of urges, desires, and judgments. It’s fixated on the past and the future, to the detriment of the here and now. (

&lt;li>Our entire lives, he argued, are governed by a voice in our heads. This voice is engaged in a ceaseless stream of thinking—most of it negative, repetitive, and self-referential. It squawks away at us from the minute we open our eyes in the morning until the minute we fall asleep at night, if it allows us to sleep at all. Talk, talk, talk: the voice is constantly judging and labeling everything in its field of vision. Its targets aren’t just external; it often viciously taunts us, too. (

&lt;li>The ego is never satisfied. No matter how much stuff we buy, no matter how many arguments we win or delicious meals we consume, the ego never feels complete. (

&lt;li>The ego is constantly comparing itself to others. It has us measuring our self-worth against the looks, wealth, and social status of everyone else. (

&lt;li>The ego thrives on drama. It keeps our old resentments and grievances alive through compulsive thought. (

&lt;li>Perhaps the most powerful Tollean insight into the ego was that it is obsessed with the past and the future, at the expense of the present. We “live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation,” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1003" rel="noopener">Location 1003&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“When you have one foot in the future and the other in the past, you piss on the present.” (

&lt;li>in the deadline-dominated world of news, I was always hurtling headlong through the day, checking things off my to-do list, constantly picturing completion instead of calmly and carefully enjoying the process. The unspoken assumption behind most of my forward momentum was that whatever was coming next would definitely be better. Only when I reached that ineffable … whatever … would I be totally satisfied.

&lt;li>“Make the present moment your friend rather than your enemy. Because many people live habitually as if the present moment were an obstacle that they need to overcome in order to get to the next moment. And imagine living your whole life like that, where always this moment is never quite right, not good enough because you need to get to the next one. That is continuous stress.” (

&lt;li>The route to true happiness, he argued, was to achieve a visceral understanding of impermanence, which would take you off the emotional roller coaster and allow you to see your dramas and desires through a wider lens. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1503" rel="noopener">Location 1503&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a nutshell, mindfulness is the ability to recognize what is happening in your mind right now—anger, jealousy, sadness, the pain of a stubbed toe, whatever—without getting carried away by it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1719" rel="noopener">Location 1719&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>According to the Buddha, we have three habitual responses to everything we experience. We want it, reject it, or we zone out. Cookies: I want. Mosquitoes: I reject. The safety instructions the flight attendants read aloud on an airplane: I zone out. Mindfulness is a fourth option, a way to view the contents of our mind with nonjudgmental remove. I found this theory elegant, but utterly unfeasible. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1721" rel="noopener">Location 1721&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our minds have this other capability—a bonus level, to put it in gamerspeak—that no one ever tells us about in school. (Not here in the West, at least.) We can do more than just think; we also have the power simply to be aware of things—without judgment, without the ego. This is not to denigrate thinking, just to say that thinking without awareness can be a harsh master. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1743" rel="noopener">Location 1743&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“People come to me a lot feeling like they ought to be loving themselves, and I actually counsel against it,” he said. His delivery was off-the-cuff and shtick-free. In stark contrast to Brach, he argued that we needed to actively get in touch with our ugly side. “Mindfulness gives us a way to examine our self-hatred without trying to make it go away, without trying to love it particularly.” Just being mindful of it, he said, could be “tremendously liberating.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=1851" rel="noopener">Location 1851&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seeing a problem clearly does not prevent you from taking action, he explained. Acceptance is not passivity. Sometimes we are justifiably displeased. What mindfulness does is create some space in your head so you can, as the Buddhists say, “respond” rather than simply “react.” In the Buddhist view, you can’t control what comes up in your head; it all arises out of a mysterious void. We spend a lot of time judging ourselves harshly for feelings that we had no role in summoning. The only thing you can control is how you handle it. (

&lt;li>He’s talking about a verse where the Buddha calls everything we experience—sights, sounds, smells, etc.—the “terrible bait of the world.” “It’s … an amazing statement,” he says. “Moment after moment, experiences are arising, and it’s as if each one has a hook … and we’re the fish. Do we bite? Or do we not bite, and just swim freely in the ocean?” (

&lt;li>After an initial period of “how dare he” indignation over Jim Murphy telling me I was never going to be a big-time anchorman, I decided to approach the problem in a Buddhist style: to lean into it, to take his views seriously, no matter how inconvenient they may have been—to respond, rather than react.

&lt;li>This, as Joseph had pointed out on retreat, is the lie we tell ourselves our whole lives: as soon as we get the next meal, party, vacation, sexual encounter, as soon as we get married, get a promotion, get to the airport check-in, get through security and consume a bouquet of Auntie Anne’s Cinnamon Sugar Stix, we’ll feel really good. But as soon as we find ourselves in the airport gate area, having ingested 470 calories’ worth of sugar and fat before dinner, we (

&lt;li>“It’s not me telling you,” she said. “It’s neuroscience that would say that our capacity to multitask is virtually nonexistent. Multitasking is a computer-derived term. We have one processor. We can’t do it.” (

&lt;li>This problem was, of course, exacerbated in the age of what had been dubbed the “infoblitzkrieg,” where it took superhuman strength to ignore the siren call of the latest tweet, or the blinking red light on the BlackBerry. Scientists had even come up with a term for this condition: “continuous partial attention.” It was a syndrome with which I was intimately familiar, even after all my meditating. (

&lt;li>Another tip: take short mindfulness breaks throughout the day. She called them “purposeful pauses.” So, for example, instead of fidgeting or tapping your fingers while your computer boots up, try to watch your breath for a few minutes. (

&lt;li>I had long assumed that ceaseless planning was the recipe for effectiveness, but Marturano’s point was that too much mental churning was counterproductive. When you lurch from one thing to the next, constantly scheming, or reacting to incoming fire, the mind gets exhausted. You get sloppy and make bad decisions. I could see how the counterintuitive act of stopping, even for a few seconds, could be a source of strength, not weakness. This was a practical complement to Joseph’s “is this useful?” mantra. It was the opposite of zoning out, (

&lt;li>Studies showed that the best way to engineer an epiphany was to work hard, focus, research, and think about a problem—and then let go. Do something else. That didn’t necessarily mean meditate, but do something that relaxes and distracts you; let your unconscious mind go to work, making connections from disparate parts of the brain. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=2850" rel="noopener">Location 2850&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>there is a self-interested, or selfish, case for being compassionate?” “Yes. Practice of compassion is ultimately benefit to you. So I usually describe: we are selfish, but be wise selfish rather than foolish selfish.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=2984" rel="noopener">Location 2984&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>if I was really interested in Buddhism, I should read his favorite book, by an ancient sage named Shantideva. (

&lt;li>Research also showed that everyone from the elderly to alcoholics to people living with AIDS patients saw their health improve if they did volunteer work. Overall, compassionate people tended to be healthier, happier, more popular, and more successful at work. (

&lt;li>had fallen, he said, into several classic “pitfalls of the path.” People often misinterpreted the dharma to mean they had to adopt a sort of meekness. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=3262" rel="noopener">Location 3262&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Another pitfall was detachment. I thought I was being mindful of my distress when I was left out of the big stories, but really I was just building a wall to keep out the things that made me angry or fearful. The final pitfall to which I’d succumbed was nihilism: an occasional sense of, “Whatever, man, everything’s impermanent.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=3266" rel="noopener">Location 3266&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Praise Allah, but also tie your camel to the post.” In other words, it’s good to take a transcendent view of the world, but don’t be a chump. (

&lt;li>“The answer is in nonattachment,” he said. In my defense, the term was deceptively bland. “It’s nonattachment to the results. I think for an ambitious person who cares about their career—who wants to create things and be successful—it’s natural to be trying really hard. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=3347" rel="noopener">Location 3347&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I couldn’t quite figure out how you could work your tail off on something and then not be attached to the outcome. I had come up through a system that venerated bootstrapping and a fierce refusal to fail. Doing this without attachment didn’t seem to fit the paradigm. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=3351" rel="noopener">Location 3351&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>again. I said, “When we last spoke, you said it’s okay to be ambitious, but don’t be attached to the results. I cut you off, as I usually do—but what does that mean?” “It’s like, you write a book, you want it to be well received, you want it to be at the top of the bestsellers list, but you have limited control over what happens. You can hire a publicist, you can do every interview, you can be prepared, but you have very little control over the marketplace. So you put it out there without attachment, so it has its own life. Everything is like that.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00KFHBNA4&amp;amp;location=3354" rel="noopener">Location 3354&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Striving is fine, as long as it’s tempered by the realization that, in an entropic universe, the final outcome is out of your control. If you don’t waste your energy on variables you cannot influence, you can focus much more effectively on those you can. When you are wisely ambitious, you do everything you can to succeed, but you are not attached to the outcome—so that if you fail, you will be maximally resilient, able to get up, dust yourself off, and get back in the fray. That, to use a loaded term, is enlightened self-interest. (

&lt;li>The Whig theory, subscribed to by almost all historians of science, including economics, is that scientific thought progresses patiently, one year after another developing, sifting, and testing theories, so that science marches onward and upward, each year, decade or generation learning more and possessing ever more correct scientific theories.

&lt;li>The concrete realization that important economic knowledge had been lost over time came to me from absorbing the great revision of the scholastics that developed in the 1950s and 1960s. The pioneering revision came dramatically in Schumpeter&amp;rsquo;s great History of Economic Analysis, and was developed in the works of Raymond de Roover, Marjorie Grice-Hutchinson and John T. Noonan. (

&lt;li>I came to the conclusion that the Calvinist emphasis could account, for example, for Smith&amp;rsquo;s otherwise puzzling championing of usury laws, as well as his shift in emphasis from the capricious, luxury-loving consumer as the determinant of value, to (

&lt;li>In the year 404 BC, the despotic state of Sparta conquered Athens and established a reign of terror known as the Rule of the Thirty Tyrants. (

&lt;li>The honour of being the first Greek economic thinker goes to the poet Hesiod, a Boeotian who lived in the very early ancient Greece of the middle of the eighth century BC. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=367" rel="noopener">Location 367&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hesiod adopts the common religious or tribal myth of the ‘Golden Age’, of man&amp;rsquo;s alleged initial state on earth as an Eden, a Paradise of limitless abundance. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=374" rel="noopener">Location 374&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Democritus contributed two important strands of thought to the development of economics. First, he was the founder of subjective value theory. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=398" rel="noopener">Location 398&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Moral values, ethics, were absolute, Democritus taught, but economic values were necessarily subjective. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=399" rel="noopener">Location 399&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Democritus, having seen the contrast between the private property economy of Athens and the oligarchic collectivism of Sparta, concluded that private property is a superior form of economic organization. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=409" rel="noopener">Location 409&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plato contributed to genuine economic science by being the first to expound and analyse the importance of the division of labour in society. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=434" rel="noopener">Location 434&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The three main schools of political thought: the Legalists, the Taoists, and the Confucians, were established from the sixth to the fourth centuries BC. Roughly, the Legalists, the latest of the three broad schools, simply believed in maximal power to the state, and advised rulers how to increase that power. The Taoists were the world&amp;rsquo;s first libertarians, who believed in virtually no interference by the state in economy or society, and the Confucians were middle-of-the-roaders on this critical issue. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=677" rel="noopener">Location 677&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By far the most interesting of the Chinese political philosophers were the Taoists, founded by the immensely important but shadowy figure of Lao Tzu. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=684" rel="noopener">Location 684&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Two centuries later, Lao Tzu&amp;rsquo;s great follower Chuang Tzu (369–c.286 BC) built on the master&amp;rsquo;s ideas of laissez-faire to push them to their logical conclusion: individualist anarchism. The influential Chuang Tzu, a great stylist who wrote in allegorical parables, was therefore the first anarchist in the history of human thought. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=701" rel="noopener">Location 701&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Taoist thought flourished for several centuries, culminating in the most determinedly anarchistic thinker, Pao Ching-yen, who lived in the early fourth century AD, and about whose life nothing is known. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=727" rel="noopener">Location 727&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a happy and stateless world, declared Pao, the people would naturally turn to thoughts of good order and not be interested in plundering their neighbours. But rulers oppress and loot the people and ‘make them toil without rest and wrest away things from them endlessly.’ In that way, theft and banditry are stimulated among the unhappy people, and arms and armour, intended to pacify the public, are stolen by bandits to intensify their plunder. ‘All these things are brought about because there are rulers.’ The common idea, concluded Pao, that strong government is needed to combat disorders among the people, commits the serious error of confusing cause and effect. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=746" rel="noopener">Location 746&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Augustine&amp;rsquo;s economic views were scattered throughout The City of God and his other highly influential writings. But he definitely, and presumably independently of Aristotle, arrived at the view that people&amp;rsquo;s payments for goods, the valuation they placed on them, was determined by their own needs rather than by any more objective criterion or by their rank in the order of nature. This was at least the basis of the later Austrian theory of subjective value. He also pointed out that it was the common desire of all men to buy cheap and to sell dear. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=850" rel="noopener">Location 850&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But St Augustine&amp;rsquo;s stress was on the individual&amp;rsquo;s personality unfolding itself and therefore progressing over time. Hence Augustine&amp;rsquo;s profound emphasis on the individual at least set the stage indirectly for an attitude favourable to innovation, economic growth and development. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=865" rel="noopener">Location 865&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If St Augustine looked benignly on the role of the merchant, he was also favourable, though not as warmly, towards the social role of rulers of state. On the one hand, Augustine took up and expanded Cicero&amp;rsquo;s parable demonstrating that Alexander the Great was simply a pirate writ large, and that the state is nothing but a large-scale and settled robber band. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=869" rel="noopener">Location 869&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In capitulary after capitulary, Charlemagne and his successors laid down detailed regulations for every aspect of economic, political and religious life throughout the empire. Many of these regulations became incorporated into the canon law of later centuries, thereby remaining influential well after the crumbling of the Carolingian Empire itself. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=894" rel="noopener">Location 894&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Charlemagne revived, greatly broadened and imposed the old doctrine of turpe lucrum. But now the prohibition was extended from the clergy to everyone, and the definition broadened from fraud to all greed and avarice, and included any disobedience of Charlemagne&amp;rsquo;s extensive price regulations. Any market deviations from these fixed prices were accused of being profiteering by either buyers or sellers and hence turpe lucrum. As a corollary, all speculative buying and selling in foodstuffs was prohibited. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=898" rel="noopener">Location 898&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since the English common law was motivated, not by a misguided attempt to aid the poor but in order to confer monopoly privileges on local owners of market sites, it is highly probable that Charlemagne, too, was trying to cartelize markets and confer privileges on market owners. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=903" rel="noopener">Location 903&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Huguccio began a radical reconstruction of Patristic teachings about private property. From the time of Huguccio, private property was to be considered a sacrosanct right derived from the natural law. The property of individuals and communities was, at least in principle, supposed to be free from arbitrary invasion on the part of the state. As ‘moderator and arbiter’ of his own goods, an individual owner could use and dispose of them as he saw fit, provided that he did not violate general legal rules. A ruler could only expropriate the property of an innocent subject if ‘public necessity’ required it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=937" rel="noopener">Location 937&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The canon lawyers adopted the same criterion for the just price. Influenced by Carolingian practice, and by hints from the sixth century Rule of St Benedict, the late twelfth century canonist and student of Gratian, Simon of Bosignano, first described the true value of goods as the price for which they commonly sold. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=1009" rel="noopener">Location 1009&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hostiensis provided the first path-breaking argument for charging a rate of interest on a loan from the very beginning, a charge that does not involve delay or guarantees. This is lucrum cessans (profit ceasing), a legitimate interest charge by the creditor to compensate him for profit foregone in investing the money himself. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=1110" rel="noopener">Location 1110&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In short, lucrum cessans anticipated the Austrian concept of opportunity cost, of income foregone, and applied it to the charging of interest. Unfortunately, however, Cardinal Hostiensis&amp;rsquo;s use of lucrum cessans was limited to non-habitual lenders who lend money out of charity to a debtor. Thus lenders could not be in the business of charging money on a loan, even on the ground of lucrum cessans. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=1112" rel="noopener">Location 1112&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The German Dominican St Albert the Great performed the enormous service to philosophy of bringing Aristotle and Aristotelianism back to Western thought. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=1200" rel="noopener">Location 1200&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>St Thomas was clearly an Aristotelian in adopting the latter&amp;rsquo;s trenchant view that the determinant of exchange value was the need, or utility, of consumers, as expressed in their demand for products. And so, this proto-Austrian aspect of value based on demand and utility was reinstated in economic thought. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=1230" rel="noopener">Location 1230&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It should come as no surprise that Aquinas, in contrast to Aristotle, was highly favourable towards the activities of the merchant. Mercantile profit, he declared, was a stipend for the merchant&amp;rsquo;s labour, and a reward for shouldering the risks of transportation. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=1266" rel="noopener">Location 1266&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Building on Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s theory of money, Aquinas pointed out its indispensability as a medium of exchange, a ‘measure’ of expression of values, and a unit of account. In contrast to Aristotle, Aquinas was not frightened at the idea of the value of money fluctuating on the market. On the contrary, Aquinas recognized that the purchasing power of money was bound to fluctuate, and was content if it fluctuated, as it usually did, more stably than did particular prices. (

&lt;li>The Whig theory, subscribed to by almost all historians of science, including economics, is that scientific thought progresses patiently, one year after another developing, sifting, and testing theories, so that science marches onward and upward, each year, decade or generation learning more and possessing ever more correct scientific theories.

&lt;li>St Thomas was clearly an Aristotelian in adopting the latter&amp;rsquo;s trenchant view that the determinant of exchange value was the need, or utility, of consumers, as expressed in their demand for products. And so, this proto-Austrian aspect of value based on demand and utility was reinstated in economic thought. (

&lt;li>The Whig theory, subscribed to by almost all historians of science, including economics, is that scientific thought progresses patiently, one year after another developing, sifting, and testing theories, so that science marches onward and upward, each year, decade or generation learning more and possessing ever more correct scientific theories.

&lt;li>The concrete realization that important economic knowledge had been lost over time came to me from absorbing the great revision of the scholastics that developed in the 1950s and 1960s. The pioneering revision came dramatically in Schumpeter&amp;rsquo;s great History of Economic Analysis, and was developed in the works of Raymond de Roover, Marjorie Grice-Hutchinson and John T. Noonan. (

&lt;li>I came to the conclusion that the Calvinist emphasis could account, for example, for Smith&amp;rsquo;s otherwise puzzling championing of usury laws, as well as his shift in emphasis from the capricious, luxury-loving consumer as the determinant of value, to (

&lt;li>In the year 404 BC, the despotic state of Sparta conquered Athens and established a reign of terror known as the Rule of the Thirty Tyrants. (

&lt;li>The honour of being the first Greek economic thinker goes to the poet Hesiod, a Boeotian who lived in the very early ancient Greece of the middle of the eighth century BC. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=367" rel="noopener">Location 367&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hesiod adopts the common religious or tribal myth of the ‘Golden Age’, of man&amp;rsquo;s alleged initial state on earth as an Eden, a Paradise of limitless abundance. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=374" rel="noopener">Location 374&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Democritus contributed two important strands of thought to the development of economics. First, he was the founder of subjective value theory. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=398" rel="noopener">Location 398&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Moral values, ethics, were absolute, Democritus taught, but economic values were necessarily subjective. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=399" rel="noopener">Location 399&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Democritus, having seen the contrast between the private property economy of Athens and the oligarchic collectivism of Sparta, concluded that private property is a superior form of economic organization. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=409" rel="noopener">Location 409&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plato contributed to genuine economic science by being the first to expound and analyse the importance of the division of labour in society. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=434" rel="noopener">Location 434&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The three main schools of political thought: the Legalists, the Taoists, and the Confucians, were established from the sixth to the fourth centuries BC. Roughly, the Legalists, the latest of the three broad schools, simply believed in maximal power to the state, and advised rulers how to increase that power. The Taoists were the world&amp;rsquo;s first libertarians, who believed in virtually no interference by the state in economy or society, and the Confucians were middle-of-the-roaders on this critical issue.

&lt;li>Two centuries later, Lao Tzu&amp;rsquo;s great follower Chuang Tzu (369–c.286 BC) built on the master&amp;rsquo;s ideas of laissez-faire to push them to their logical conclusion: individualist anarchism. The influential Chuang Tzu, a great stylist who wrote in allegorical parables, was therefore the first anarchist in the history of human thought. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=701" rel="noopener">Location 701&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Taoist thought flourished for several centuries, culminating in the most determinedly anarchistic thinker, Pao Ching-yen, who lived in the early fourth century AD, and about whose life nothing is known. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=727" rel="noopener">Location 727&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a happy and stateless world, declared Pao, the people would naturally turn to thoughts of good order and not be interested in plundering their neighbours. But rulers oppress and loot the people and ‘make them toil without rest and wrest away things from them endlessly.’ In that way, theft and banditry are stimulated among the unhappy people, and arms and armour, intended to pacify the public, are stolen by bandits to intensify their plunder. ‘All these things are brought about because there are rulers.’ The common idea, concluded Pao, that strong government is needed to combat disorders among the people, commits the serious error of confusing cause and effect. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=746" rel="noopener">Location 746&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Augustine&amp;rsquo;s economic views were scattered throughout The City of God and his other highly influential writings. But he definitely, and presumably independently of Aristotle, arrived at the view that people&amp;rsquo;s payments for goods, the valuation they placed on them, was determined by their own needs rather than by any more objective criterion or by their rank in the order of nature. This was at least the basis of the later Austrian theory of subjective value. He also pointed out that it was the common desire of all men to buy cheap and to sell dear. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=850" rel="noopener">Location 850&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But St Augustine&amp;rsquo;s stress was on the individual&amp;rsquo;s personality unfolding itself and therefore progressing over time. Hence Augustine&amp;rsquo;s profound emphasis on the individual at least set the stage indirectly for an attitude favourable to innovation, economic growth and development. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=865" rel="noopener">Location 865&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If St Augustine looked benignly on the role of the merchant, he was also favourable, though not as warmly, towards the social role of rulers of state. On the one hand, Augustine took up and expanded Cicero&amp;rsquo;s parable demonstrating that Alexander the Great was simply a pirate writ large, and that the state is nothing but a large-scale and settled robber band.

&lt;li>In capitulary after capitulary, Charlemagne and his successors laid down detailed regulations for every aspect of economic, political and religious life throughout the empire. Many of these regulations became incorporated into the canon law of later centuries, thereby remaining influential well after the crumbling of the Carolingian Empire itself. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=894" rel="noopener">Location 894&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Charlemagne revived, greatly broadened and imposed the old doctrine of turpe lucrum. But now the prohibition was extended from the clergy to everyone, and the definition broadened from fraud to all greed and avarice, and included any disobedience of Charlemagne&amp;rsquo;s extensive price regulations. Any market deviations from these fixed prices were accused of being profiteering by either buyers or sellers and hence turpe lucrum. As a corollary, all speculative buying and selling in foodstuffs was prohibited. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=898" rel="noopener">Location 898&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since the English common law was motivated, not by a misguided attempt to aid the poor but in order to confer monopoly privileges on local owners of market sites, it is highly probable that Charlemagne, too, was trying to cartelize markets and confer privileges on market owners. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=903" rel="noopener">Location 903&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Huguccio began a radical reconstruction of Patristic teachings about private property. From the time of Huguccio, private property was to be considered a sacrosanct right derived from the natural law. The property of individuals and communities was, at least in principle, supposed to be free from arbitrary invasion on the part of the state. As ‘moderator and arbiter’ of his own goods, an individual owner could use and dispose of them as he saw fit, provided that he did not violate general legal rules. A ruler could only expropriate the property of an innocent subject if ‘public necessity’ required it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=937" rel="noopener">Location 937&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The canon lawyers adopted the same criterion for the just price. Influenced by Carolingian practice, and by hints from the sixth century Rule of St Benedict, the late twelfth century canonist and student of Gratian, Simon of Bosignano, first described the true value of goods as the price for which they commonly sold. (

&lt;li>Hostiensis provided the first path-breaking argument for charging a rate of interest on a loan from the very beginning, a charge that does not involve delay or guarantees. This is lucrum cessans (profit ceasing), a legitimate interest charge by the creditor to compensate him for profit foregone in investing the money himself. (

&lt;li>In short, lucrum cessans anticipated the Austrian concept of opportunity cost, of income foregone, and applied it to the charging of interest. Unfortunately, however, Cardinal Hostiensis&amp;rsquo;s use of lucrum cessans was limited to non-habitual lenders who lend money out of charity to a debtor. Thus lenders could not be in the business of charging money on a loan, even on the ground of lucrum cessans. (

&lt;li>The German Dominican St Albert the Great performed the enormous service to philosophy of bringing Aristotle and Aristotelianism back to Western thought. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0041KL4UU&amp;amp;location=1200" rel="noopener">Location 1200&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>St Thomas was clearly an Aristotelian in adopting the latter&amp;rsquo;s trenchant view that the determinant of exchange value was the need, or utility, of consumers, as expressed in their demand for products. And so, this proto-Austrian aspect of value based on demand and utility was reinstated in economic thought. (

&lt;li>It should come as no surprise that Aquinas, in contrast to Aristotle, was highly favourable towards the activities of the merchant. Mercantile profit, he declared, was a stipend for the merchant&amp;rsquo;s labour, and a reward for shouldering the risks of transportation. (

&lt;li>Building on Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s theory of money, Aquinas pointed out its indispensability as a medium of exchange, a ‘measure’ of expression of values, and a unit of account. In contrast to Aristotle, Aquinas was not frightened at the idea of the value of money fluctuating on the market. On the contrary, Aquinas recognized that the purchasing power of money was bound to fluctuate, and was content if it fluctuated, as it usually did, more stably than did particular prices. (

&lt;li>Huguccio began a radical reconstruction of Patristic teachings about private property. From the time of Huguccio, private property was to be considered a sacrosanct right derived from the natural law. The property of individuals and communities was, at least in principle, supposed to be free from arbitrary invasion on the part of the state. As ‘moderator and arbiter’ of his own goods, an individual owner could use and dispose of them as he saw fit, provided that he did not violate general legal rules. A ruler could only expropriate the property of an innocent subject if ‘public necessity’ required it. (

&lt;li>The canon lawyers adopted the same criterion for the just price. Influenced by Carolingian practice, and by hints from the sixth century Rule of St Benedict, the late twelfth century canonist and student of Gratian, Simon of Bosignano, first described the true value of goods as the price for which they commonly sold.

&lt;li>Hostiensis provided the first path-breaking argument for charging a rate of interest on a loan from the very beginning, a charge that does not involve delay or guarantees. This is lucrum cessans (profit ceasing), a legitimate interest charge by the creditor to compensate him for profit foregone in investing the money himself. (

&lt;li>In short, lucrum cessans anticipated the Austrian concept of opportunity cost, of income foregone, and applied it to the charging of interest. Unfortunately, however, Cardinal Hostiensis&amp;rsquo;s use of lucrum cessans was limited to non-habitual lenders who lend money out of charity to a debtor. Thus lenders could not be in the business of charging money on a loan, even on the ground of lucrum cessans. (

&lt;li>The German Dominican St Albert the Great performed the enormous service to philosophy of bringing Aristotle and Aristotelianism back to Western thought. (

&lt;li>St Thomas was clearly an Aristotelian in adopting the latter&amp;rsquo;s trenchant view that the determinant of exchange value was the need, or utility, of consumers, as expressed in their demand for products. And so, this proto-Austrian aspect of value based on demand and utility was reinstated in economic thought. (

&lt;li>It should come as no surprise that Aquinas, in contrast to Aristotle, was highly favourable towards the activities of the merchant. Mercantile profit, he declared, was a stipend for the merchant&amp;rsquo;s labour, and a reward for shouldering the risks of transportation. (

&lt;li>Building on Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s theory of money, Aquinas pointed out its indispensability as a medium of exchange, a ‘measure’ of expression of values, and a unit of account. In contrast to Aristotle, Aquinas was not frightened at the idea of the value of money fluctuating on the market. On the contrary, Aquinas recognized that the purchasing power of money was bound to fluctuate, and was content if it fluctuated, as it usually did, more stably than did particular prices. (

&lt;p>Document Note: In industrialised process where the output of the model is used to take decisions it is a bad practice to over-rely on a low number of variables due to fail to be reported or technical failure. For this reason it might be important to dillute the importance of a variable to make the model more robust.
In linear regression models we may impose penalties or constraints on the magnitude of the coefficients but this is not possible in decission trees.
Different workarounds include: introduce noise to the data or to use the more important variables in the last steps of the decission.
Proposed solution, extended trees: We fit a base tree without most important variables, then extend the leaves of previous trees with variable left out.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Document Note: But the goal of data science is not to execute. Rather, the goal is to learn and develop profound new business capabilities. Algorithmic products and services like and more can’t be designed up-front. They need to be learned. There are no blueprints to follow; these are novel capabilities with inherent uncertainty. &lt;strong>With data science, you learn as you go, not before you go&lt;/strong>.
The generalist moves fluidly between functions, extending the data pipeline to add more data, trying new features in the model, deploying new versions to production for causal measurement, and repeating the steps as quickly as new ideas come to her.
Key ideas

&lt;li>Dysfunctional relationship between DS and DE is common in the industry. &amp;gt; What is your experience here?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unless you have tons of people you get that sort of relationship. But that is not very efficient&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generalists able to use platform is the answer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Change mindshit to autonomous doers. Engineers work horizontally, DS vertically&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to make platform engieers to stay ahead of DS teams? &amp;gt; My proposal is to involve them in our decisions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We are sacrificing technical efficiency for velocity and autonomy. It is important to recognize this as a deliberate trade off.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DS they are well equipped to make trade offs between technical and support costs vs. requirements.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Document Note: But the goal of data science is not to execute. Rather, the goal is to learn and develop profound new business capabilities. Algorithmic products and services like and more can’t be designed up-front. They need to be learned. There are no blueprints to follow; these are novel capabilities with inherent uncertainty. &lt;strong>With data science, you learn as you go, not before you go&lt;/strong>.
The generalist moves fluidly between functions, extending the data pipeline to add more data, trying new features in the model, deploying new versions to production for causal measurement, and repeating the steps as quickly as new ideas come to her.
Key ideas
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dysfunctional relationship between DS and DE is common in the industry. &amp;gt; What is your experience here?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unless you have tons of people you get that sort of relationship. But that is not very efficient&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generalists able to use platform is the answer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Change mindshit to autonomous doers. Engineers work horizontally, DS vertically&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to make platform engieers to stay ahead of DS teams? &amp;gt; My proposal is to involve them in our decisions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We are sacrificing technical efficiency for velocity and autonomy. It is important to recognize this as a deliberate trade off.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DS they are well equipped to make trade offs between technical and support costs vs. requirements.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Algorithmic products and services like and more can’t be designed up-front. They need to be learned&lt;/li>

&lt;li>This division of labor by function is so ingrained in us even today that we are quick to organize our teams accordingly. Data science is no exception (

&lt;li>las, we should not be optimizing our data science teams for productivity gains; that is what you do when you know what it is you’re producing—pins or otherwise—and are merely seeking incremental efficiencies. (

&lt;li>Full Title: Data for All&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Category: #books&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Data for All&amp;rdquo; is a comprehensive guide on the topic of digital data, written by John Thompson, which provides insight into the importance of understanding and taking control of our data in the rapidly changing data landscape. The author presents thought-provoking ideas on how individuals can be empowered to monetize their data and provides a vision for a future where data is managed in a fair and equitable manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book is aimed at the general population and focuses on the topic of digital data, which has become an integral part of our lives. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the consequences of our actions related to data, including its potential misuse and abuse, and the responsibility of each individual to take control of their data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>John argues that the data industry has devalued personal data and relegated it to a meaningless commodity, leading to a situation where companies act as if they own the data created by individuals. Thompson predicts that this situation will change in the near future and highlights the importance of individuals having control over their data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The author also argues that individuals should be paid for the data they create and that there should be legislation and regulation to address data privacy concerns and promote a fairer distribution of the value of data. Thompson proposes a framework for data stewardship that takes public interest into consideration and suggests a public data commons model as one of the solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Data for All is written to be an accessible book that is easy to read for the general population. (Location 14)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>digital data is a ubiquitous element in our lives. (Location 51)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The best we can do is be armed with knowledge, understand the possible ramifications of our actions, the implications of the length of the life of the data we are creating each and every minute of every day, the potential for misuse and abuse of the information and data once it is beyond our grasp and control. (Location 91)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each of us is responsible for our data and for the lifecycle of our data. Whether we have ever thought about it or not, it is up to us to take control of our data and to actively make conscious choices (Location 101)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>today. The data ecosystem was never intended to become what it is today. That is because the data ecosystem has organically and rapidly evolved over the past 30 years in a globally distributed manner due to the independent actions of corporations, (Location 112)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>These millions of entities are acting on their own best, narrowly defined, interests. No one is driving the bus, and that needs to change. (Location 114)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the company HAD met the legal burden, but in the end, it is DNA data. DNA data, at least a complete genome, is the ultimate personal identifier, isn’t it? It is impossible to truly deidentify your complete genome. (Location 134)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>So when you sign up for a service and provide your swab with your DNA sample, the control of your resulting data is not with the DNA firm you signed up with. The policies they originally posted mean little to nothing and can be changed at any time sometimes without notice to you. In (Location 154)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“[The] first rule of data: once you hand it over, you lose control of it. You have no idea how the terms of service will change for your ‘recreational’ DNA sample,”[5] (Location 162)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The work of Arthur and his company sounds interesting and innovative for the early 1920s and it was, but the important item for us to consider is that over time, the ACNielsen company convinced the grocery store operators to provide, at no cost, or at very low cost, to his company all of the sales records of each and every one of their stores. (Location 181)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The next evolution of the industry included the first generation of data brokers like InfoUSA and other firms that worked predominantly in the direct mail industry. The second generation of data brokers included Experian, Acxiom, and Epsilon. These three firms are mostly known in the arena of credit scores and understanding credit worthiness of individuals. And today we have the third generation of data brokers that are focused on collecting information from on-line activities. Activities that include location data, browsing behavior, and purchasing. (Location 187)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The precedence set in this instance is that as data ownership has almost no value it can be transferred from individuals to companies without the consent of the individuals that created the data. This precedence of devaluing data and relegating data to a status of a meaningless commodity is at the core of the situation we find ourselves in today as it relates to data. (Location 194)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In 2006, Humby coined the phrase “Data is the new oil”. Michael Palmer expanded on Humby&amp;rsquo;s quote by saying, like oil, data is “valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used.

&lt;li>One portion of the Data Governance Act (DGA) that is noteworthy are the clauses which outline the creation of Data Intermediaries (DI) also known as data cooperatives or data unions.[30] These are the institutions, organizations and frameworks that will enable citizens, EU citizens in the beginning, to take control of their data to move, aggregate, share and monetize the data as they wish.

&lt;li>Some defend privacy as focusing on control over information about oneself (Parent, 1983), while others defend it as a broader concept required for human dignity (Bloustein, 1964), or crucial for intimacy (Gerstein, 1978; Inness, 1992). Other commentators defend privacy as necessary for the development of varied and meaningful interpersonal relationships (Location 2269)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Think about the activities where you seek privacy and the motivating factors for why you seek it. Now overlay those activities with your online activities. Where is the intersection of your desire for privacy and your online activities? Would you want more control to access, modify or delete data related to those activities?

&lt;li>“It was long unanimously held among economists that natural resources that were collectively used by their users would be over-exploited and destroyed in the long-term. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters, and forests. She showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.”[9] (Location 2830)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Her work created a new understanding of the actual delineation between common resources and private property.

&lt;li>Your health status will play a part in valuing your data. People who have rare diseases or highly unusual blood types or disorders may be able to demand a premium price for their diagnostic, prescription history, medical records and genetic material and sequencing. (Location 3934)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“What if Facebook was an equitable business partner that shared half of its profit with those of us who actually provide the data that makes its business model run? Using my math (which is, again, open to debate), the average Facebook user would earn $10.77 per quarter. But, what if you are a more active user than average? Twice as active? Five times as active? Out of curiosity, I broke the numbers down below. · Half as active: $5.38 · Twice as active: $21.53 · Five times as active: $53.83 (Location 3942)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I believe, and I could be way off in my estimate of the annual data dividend, but in my view, there could be people who make over $20,000 to $50,000 or more each year from licensing their personal data. (Location 3954)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take note of the word licensing. You will not sell your data to companies; you will license it. You will retain ownership of the data and you will provide a limited use license to your data. (Location 3956)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First, don’t do business with companies that you know are hurting you, your families, your communities, your country, and the world. If you are involved with such a company, stop using their service, delete all your data, tell all your friends to stop using the platform. (Location 3991)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Second, sign up for every “do not mail” list that you can. It doesn’t take long, and it really works. Most of our discussions have been about online data and that is the most important category, but companies still mail a significant amount of material and the lists and data being held by those companies is significant, and those companies are the most aggressive resellers of your data. (Location 3993)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sign up for every “do not call” list that you can. The results are the same as above, but just on your mobile device. (Location 4001)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I wanted all of you to know that the world of data that we live in today did not come about by happenstance, it was designed and built on purpose. (Location 4012)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I am keen for everyone to know about the flawed data ownership model that has persisted since the beginning of the modern data industry. (Location 4022)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I felt and feel that it was and is important for you to know and understand how trust plays an important role in your relationship with your data and the organizations that want to use your data. As with all relationships, we need to have a baseline of trust. (Location 4031)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I feel that it is imperative for the people who will read this book to be aware of the massive, latent amount of economic value that will be created through the new world of data and that the economic value should be more evenly distributed, (Location 4037)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Data for All is written to be an accessible book that is easy to read for the general population. (Location 14)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>digital data is a ubiquitous element in our lives. (Location 51)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The best we can do is be armed with knowledge, understand the possible ramifications of our actions, the implications of the length of the life of the data we are creating each and every minute of every day, the potential for misuse and abuse of the information and data once it is beyond our grasp and control. (Location 91)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each of us is responsible for our data and for the lifecycle of our data. Whether we have ever thought about it or not, it is up to us to take control of our data and to actively make conscious choices (Location 101)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>today. The data ecosystem was never intended to become what it is today. That is because the data ecosystem has organically and rapidly evolved over the past 30 years in a globally distributed manner due to the independent actions of corporations, (Location 112)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>These millions of entities are acting on their own best, narrowly defined, interests. No one is driving the bus, and that needs to change. (Location 114)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the company HAD met the legal burden, but in the end, it is DNA data. DNA data, at least a complete genome, is the ultimate personal identifier, isn’t it? It is impossible to truly deidentify your complete genome. (Location 134)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>So when you sign up for a service and provide your swab with your DNA sample, the control of your resulting data is not with the DNA firm you signed up with. The policies they originally posted mean little to nothing and can be changed at any time sometimes without notice to you. In (Location 154)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“[The] first rule of data: once you hand it over, you lose control of it. You have no idea how the terms of service will change for your ‘recreational’ DNA sample,”[5] (Location 162)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The work of Arthur and his company sounds interesting and innovative for the early 1920s and it was, but the important item for us to consider is that over time, the ACNielsen company convinced the grocery store operators to provide, at no cost, or at very low cost, to his company all of the sales records of each and every one of their stores. (Location 181)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The next evolution of the industry included the first generation of data brokers like InfoUSA and other firms that worked predominantly in the direct mail industry. The second generation of data brokers included Experian, Acxiom, and Epsilon. These three firms are mostly known in the arena of credit scores and understanding credit worthiness of individuals. And today we have the third generation of data brokers that are focused on collecting information from on-line activities. Activities that include location data, browsing behavior, and purchasing. (Location 187)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The precedence set in this instance is that as data ownership has almost no value it can be transferred from individuals to companies without the consent of the individuals that created the data. This precedence of devaluing data and relegating data to a status of a meaningless commodity is at the core of the situation we find ourselves in today as it relates to data. (Location 194)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In 2006, Humby coined the phrase “Data is the new oil”. Michael Palmer expanded on Humby&amp;rsquo;s quote by saying, like oil, data is “valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used. Oil has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc. to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so, data must be broken down and analyzed for it to have value.”[10] (Location 212)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In 1998, Google was founded. This was one of the first instances of consumers obtaining a free online service in exchange for unfettered use of the data that the users themselves created. The (Location 218)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shortly after the creation and release of the Google service, the founders reacted in a spectacularly unimaginative manner by deciding that their business model would be advertising based. Technologically, Google is an interesting company, but from a business model perspective, they are about as dull as dishwater because venture capitalists and financial analysts prefer stability and predictability in business operations. (Location 230)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ACNielsen founded his firm 70 years ago by gaining free access to sales data to analyze how to sell more groceries to people through more targeted, and refined pricing, better store assortments, and improved shelf space optimization. That ultimately led to targeting of radio and television advertising/ Today we are offered virtually the same thing on our computers over the internet with very little to no change in the underlying premise. (Location 233)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To them, we remain THE commodity to be sold, through our data. (Location 237)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The rights of individuals to own, protect, manage, and monetize their data has been usurped by a past that has little to no relevance to the data ecosystem we have today. (Location 246)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Companies around the world have acted like they own our data. That is not true and is only a temporary situation that will change in the near future. (Location 247)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Haugen leaked one Facebook study that found that 13.5% of U.K. teen girls in one survey say their suicidal thoughts became more frequent after starting on Instagram. Another leaked study found 17% of teen girls say their eating disorders got worse after using Instagram.”[19]About 32% of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse, Facebook&amp;rsquo;s researchers found, which was first reported by the Journal. (Location 274)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The early founders of the data and analytics industry like Arthur Nielsen, Danny Moore, Wayne Levy, moved slowly at first, seeking to make money by selling insights on how to sell more household consumable goods. In the 90’s, analytics professionals were very careful to work on analytics that would help understand buyer behavior, assiduously avoiding unethical use cases. (Location 284)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>our individual data is not that valuable and that it is like sand, ubiquitous and requiring much processing to make it valuable to firms and ultimately to us in the form of targeted messaging and advertising. (Location 313)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Data is the New Sun is a more relevant analogy&amp;hellip; as the sun can power an infinite number of uses at zero marginal cost, never wears out (or depreciates) and never depletes! At its heart, digital transformation is about economics: transitioning from yesterday’s “economics of oil” mentality (expensive to find, expensive to extract, expensive to transport, environmentally hazardous, depletes, messy, dirty, and environmental costly) to embracing the modern “economics of the sun” (clean, never depletes, never depreciates and is readily available to fuel an infinite number of uses).”[23] (Location 326)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“The most valuable asset of Uber, the ride-hailing service&amp;hellip; is the data of the people who use it. The prime asset of Google, the largest library, which owns no physical library, is the index that takes customers to their desired websites. Therefore, the new valuable asset is not gold, but it is data. Data has become the new gold!”[24] The professor’s logic and arguments are solid and based in reality, but I do think they are limited in past historical thinking and are too limiting to the prospects of data. (Location 334)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data exchanges, like stock exchanges, are where people and companies will congregate, virtually, to offer, buy and sell data in an open market. (Location 349)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>data as “the new plastic”, because “we create a lot, we struggle to know what to do with it and it tends to turn up in the wrong places. And, for all the talk about the democratization of data, business is not yet culturally geared up to handle this. There’s a lot to do.”[27] (Location 356)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The characteristics of the sun and data are closely aligned in a physical and metaphorical sense. (Location 371)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People should be allowed to take an active part in the management/control, use, and monetization of their data. Today, individuals can engage in this process but it is disjointed, complicated, time consuming, and most people do not see the value in engaging the current process to limit and control their data. (Location 381)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Forward thinking governments have started to discuss the creation and regulation of data exchanges and data commons.[31] Companies will follow with offerings and capabilities where it will be simple for every person to make choices about the use of their data. These companies will make money from enabling individuals in the process of proactively managing, controlling, sharing, monetizing their data. (Location 386)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An informed population can and will make better decisions that can affect social change with this book and these ideas. (Location 393)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In western democracies, the idea of some all-knowing Big Brother is a fiction, no matter what some politicians tell you. The real problem is commercial companies, specifically the younger, more intelligent companies, (Location 566)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we take the location data and we add the browsing data, now we have where you went, the routes you took, the time you spent at each location, and we have the products you viewed, the content you read, the various options you considered. Did (Location 633)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Companies target me with offers and stories that I am not interested in. Therefore, they can’t be doing much with my data given how bad they are at understanding me and my true interests.” What individuals are missing is that companies are not good at understanding the difference between tangential and core interests today, but they are getting better and will get much better in the future. (Location 653)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is important that we are clear that collecting data of all types and analyzing with ever increasing accuracy and speed is the goal of nearly all companies and will remain so for the foreseeable future. We cannot be complacent about the current lack of abilities (Location 658)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The most impressive firms and data science teams know and understand that the goal in all data collection efforts is to collect enough multi-faceted data about any person, behavior, or situation to be able to analyze, model, predict, prescribe, simulate, and optimize that situation to the interests of the parties executing the collecting and modeling activities. (Location 717)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The point is that the “free” services are not free. You are paying for them with your data and your agreement to allow these firms to observe, examine, aggregate, analyze, target, and sell you as a commodity. (Location 812)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“This new digital economy is described in a variety of ways: as a cognitive capitalism, where a systematic process of privatization of information in different forms allows for maximization of profits (Bauwens et al., 2019; Fumagalli et al., 2019), as a data colonialism, in which data is used to subjugate and transform social relations (Couldry &amp;amp; Mejias, 2019), or as a form of surveillance capitalism, in which various technological apparatuses monitor humans and try to predict and control human behavior for the sake of profit (Zuboff, 2019). (Location 841)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Those who do not have the luxury of considering the implications of sharing their data; those who live in poverty or make just enough to get by; those that are rarely in a position to worry about what is being done with their data. (Location 1023)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The goal here is moving people on the margin toward being aware, interested, caring, and actively engaged in understanding and acting on topics related to their data. (Location 1082)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since you own your data, you have the full rights and abilities to grant or revoke a limited use license for your data. (Location 1115)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can, in the future, revoke their right to use your data. That is the first step that GDPR has taken in relation to data owned by EU citizens. (Location 1117)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What if you don’t like how airline companies are contributing to climate change? You set the price of the use of your data for any airline to access and use your data in their operations, marketing and analytics efforts at 100 times, or a 1,000 times, or a million times the price that you would charge to a company that is involved in organic and sustainable farming, (Location 1129)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children are being given electronic devices to distract them at younger and younger ages. These children are creating data and that data is being used to create new interfaces, new games, new modes of engagement; all of which are highly addictive. (Location 1157)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We asked how much the game cost. They responded that it was free. We explained that it did not cost them money to play the game, but that the game was not free. They asked what we meant. We went on to explain that they gave their name, age, e-mail address, location, and player activity to the company in order to play the game. (Location 1169)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We taught our children to think about their choices critically and proactively. That is all a parent can do. We should all be doing this with every child that we are responsible and accountable for. (Location 1194)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Personally, managing and monetizing your data is not possible today, but it will be in the coming years. (Location 1214)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most people in the world do not have a stream or streams of passive income. “Passive income includes regular earnings from a source other than an employer or contractor. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says passive income can come from two sources: rental property or a business in which one does not actively participate, such as being paid book royalties or stock dividends,”[25] or a data dividend. Think about how nice that will be. Money for doing the things that you were going to do anyway and a stream of money that keeps coming each new week, month, or year. (Location 1217)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data monetization stems from the concept of ownership of data held by the individuals that have created and are creating the data. (Location 1224)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The laws that are being drafted now envision that each person will be able to access the entire universe of their data and be able to set usage conditions and rules, monetary terms for each data element, date ranges of where data can used and where it cannot be used, exclusion lists of companies that cannot use your data, inclusion lists of preferred companies that can use your data as you have designated on preferred terms. (Location 1227)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You should be getting paid for the data you create on a regular and on-going basis, not the management teams of some random companies. (Location 1235)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What they do care about is corporate performance and growth, typically denominated in monetary terms. Yes, they all talk about products and services and helping the world, but it really comes down to the performance metrics around revenue. (Location 1242)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The data you create is yours and the revenue stream from that data should be yours. (Location 1243)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>data or information has the following unique characteristics: · Is nonrivalrous · Is nondepleting · Is regenerative and nearly unlimited · Has relatively low inventory costs and transportation/transmission costs · Is more difficult to control and own · Is ecofriendly · If you spill it, you can’t clean it up[28] Data is truly and radically different than other commodities that the world has known in the past and should be treated in new and substantially different ways. (Location 1277)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Typically, in the UK people trust the government and don’t trust [the tech] industry, and in the US people trust industry and don’t trust the government,” he says. More should be done to assuage fears about how tech giants handle user data, he adds. “To an extent, it’s how people are brought up and therefore cultural. But for people in the UK to trust these large American companies then you need to have serious legislation and regulation.”[32] (Location 1302)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The economic, social, monetary, and societal value of data will be more evenly distributed across societies, groups, and individuals. Understand, know and become a part of this movement. Talk about it at social gatherings. Post on social media. Talk with your professional colleagues who are involved in the lifecycle of any and all data. Reach out to your elected government officials and tell them that legislation related to data and your rights needs to be a priority, because (Location 1311)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Social media does a significant amount of damage to the world by algorithmically targeting people in the developing world with messages of division. Those people would benefit the most from a data dividend. (Location 1316)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One of the goals of these programs is slow or stop change that enables individuals to access, manage, and monetize their data. These lobbying efforts and associated proposals are very well designed, funded, planned, and are being executed in an orchestrated manner that is designed counter to improving access to data. (Location 1466)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is opposition to change in the world of data from entities that profit from today&amp;rsquo;s data ecosystem. (Location 1480)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When I was an adolescent it seemed the majority of people trusted our system of government or democracy; the US government, the media, our schools, and most of the institutions that make up American society to do what is in the best interest of we as individuals, the country, and the world. This was one aspect of what was referred to as American Exceptionalism.[4] (Location 1540)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By the end of the 1970s, only about a quarter of Americans felt that they could trust the government at least most of the time.”[5] (Location 1546)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Figure (Location 1548)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Autocratic leaders tend to be interested in shielding the public from data, making government operations more opaque and generally trend toward secrecy rather than openness. (Location 1562)

&lt;li>Contrary to how we treat, talk about, and perceive CEOs, they are simply people that find themselves in positions of influence and power, often more based on opportunity over ability. (Location 1600)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Like many Americans, Veselka’s daily life is saturated with the products and services pushed by big technology companies, paid and free. (Location 1629)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One of the major problems in the technology market is that there are not enough compelling options for the population to choose from. (Location 1665)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Internet companies, by contrast, got an exemption in the now-notorious Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which says content created by users is not the responsibility of web platforms. (Location 1677)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I believe that our data has the same type of intrinsic value and that we should be paid each and every time a data element that we have created is used. Perhaps we are paid a millionth of a penny, or perhaps we set the rate for what we are paid by the type of organization that wants to use our data. We will delve into this topic more deeply later in the book, but I wanted to make the comparison to music royalties (Location 1779)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>our data has value, we should be paid when our data is used in a manner that delivers revenue and profit to any commercial organization. (Location 1782)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The concept is being discussed today and one name that is used to refer to the idea in practice is a data dividend. How would you like to get a check each month or every year for the use of your data? (Location 1784)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I believe individuals should be empowered to and should be able to easily set the price of our data used in each industry, company, and application. (Location 1786)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“The public sphere needs an ‘ecosystem of trust’ which could set out objectives of re-usage of data for the common good while protecting individual rights&amp;hellip; related to data, asserting that the systemic level of data assemblage must be re-conceptualized to reject the data-as-a-commodity view and take public interest into consideration. For data stewardship to achieve its goals, it is necessary to consider the inherent properties of data as commons&amp;hellip; framework&amp;hellip;.[A] public data commons as the model that is best suited to secure European rights and values while increasing data sharing at the same time.”[27] (Location 1838)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Data Governance Act is a single step toward creating data commons that will collect data with the express purpose of using that data for public good and the good of everyone involved and not in just some conceptual manner, but in a tangible monetary manner for each EU citizen. (Location 1857)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Data Act will be a major new initiative to ensure fairness by providing better control for data sharing to citizens and businesses. [Through the Data] Act, users will have more control over the data they generate via their smart objects and EU businesses more possibilities to compete and innovate and easily transfer data between service providers. The Data Act will aim at clarifying for EU consumers and businesses who can use and access what data for which purposes. (Location 1861)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One portion of the Data Governance Act (DGA) that is noteworthy are the clauses which outline the creation of Data Intermediaries (DI) also known as data cooperatives or data unions.[30] These are the institutions, organizations and frameworks that will enable citizens, EU citizens in the beginning, to take control of their data to move, aggregate, share and monetize the data as they wish. (Location 1869)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The overall level of trust granted these organizations by the general public is at an all-time low. These organizations are actively perpetuating a system the source of significant and valuable raw material, the users. We do not tolerate companies that egregiously exploit natural resources for the gain of a few. We should not tolerate the same abuse of our data going forward. (Location 2024)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Privacy relates to freedom of choice and control in the sphere of one’s personal information– choices regarding what information you wish to share and, perhaps more important, what you do not want shared with others. (Location 2255)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some defend privacy as focusing on control over information about oneself (Parent, 1983), while others defend it as a broader concept required for human dignity (Bloustein, 1964), or crucial for intimacy (Gerstein, 1978; Inness, 1992). Other commentators defend privacy as necessary for the development of varied and meaningful interpersonal relationships (Location 2269)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Think about the activities where you seek privacy and the motivating factors for why you seek it. Now overlay those activities with your online activities. Where is the intersection of your desire for privacy and your online activities? Would you want more control to access, modify or delete data related to those activities? Would you want to charge companies more money to access your data related to those activities, or would you prefer to block all companies from accessing that data? (Location 2299)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>appears that privacy exhibits many of the characteristics of sleep. (Location 2331)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Privacy and secrecy are often confused. (Location 2340)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Privacy is consensual where secrecy is not; that is, there is a “right to privacy” but no equivalent “right to secrecy.” Those stigmatized or disadvantaged social groups who have little or no access to privacy utilize secrecy to conceal their behavior.”[23] (Location 2342)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When people know they are deprived of the right of privacy they will feel anxious, nervous, and worried about concealing data and information that may disadvantage them or their loved ones, colleagues, or compatriots. (Location 2348)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Privacy enables people to withdraw information, and/or their physical self, from the public view. (Location 2363)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People talk about and profess that they want a high degree of privacy, but then they regularly act in ways that actively reduces or eliminates the degree of privacy that they actually have. It is a paradox, (Location 2387)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Large, complex organizations use data-sharing platforms to facilitate collaboration on data-driven projects, both within and between organizations. (Location 2744)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“It was long unanimously held among economists that natural resources that were collectively used by their users would be over-exploited and destroyed in the long-term. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters, and forests. She showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.”[9] (Location 2830)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Her work created a new understanding of the actual delineation between common resources and private property. She and her colleagues clarified and codified how organically organized groups optimized the management of common resources for long term sustainability in opposition to the previously held theory that all common pool resources would be exploited, depleted, and most likely destroyed. (Location 2843)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From the work of Elinor Ostrom, and others, the advocates of Open Data and Open Software extended her research, findings and insights from forestry, irrigation, and policing systems to the new worlds of data and software. (Location 2849)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knowledge is open if anyone is free to access, use, modify, and share it— subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness.”[14] (Location 2860)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open Data evolved in conjunction and in parallel with the concept of Open-Source Software (Location 2874)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The OKF is a not-for-profit organization that works to communicate, train and bring about the use of open data on a global basis. The mission of the OKF is, “to create a more open world– a world where all non-personal information is open, free for everyone to use, build on and share; and creators and innovators are fairly recognized and rewarded.”[19] It is worthwhile to note that the OKF’s mission exempts personal information from their definition of open. (Location 2893)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open Data is an economic imperative that can drive a level of value generation such that it can be a driving force in lifting sections of populations and younger generations out of poverty. Open Data needs to be ubiquitous across all governments and all relevant data, and it will be in the coming years. (Location 2948)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Data exchanges are emerging as a key component of the data economy. By connecting data suppliers and consumers through a seamless experience, data exchanges have created a modern-day gold rush to help modern, digital organizations address their insatiable hunger for data. And, by eliminating the friction from finding, acquiring, and integrating data, these exchanges make it easy for any company to monetize its data assets and create new revenue streams.”[27] (Location 2971)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Shanghai Data Exchange was established to address the major difficulties in data trading including identification of data ownership, pricing of data, reaching mutual trust between transaction parties, initiating transactions and overall supervision, said local authorities.[30] (Location 2982)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Data Marketplace - A data marketplace is a public data exchange open to any company that wants to supply or consume data. Some marketplaces are global in scope, spanning every industry, function, and type of data.[31] (Location 2994)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Data intermediation services would include&amp;hellip; data pools established jointly by several legal or natural persons with the intention to license the use of such a pool to all interested parties in a manner that all participants contributing to the pool would receive a reward for their contribution to the pool.”[32] (Location 3008)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One company that is working toward creating data unions that can be managed in a unified and consistent manner is Pooldata.io.[34] (Location 3027)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data lineage is the same as your genealogical lineage. When new data is created from existing data; or generated from raw, aggregated, or other natural source of data, the new data has a lineage— a connection to the source or original data. (Location 3258)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tracking data lineage is not hard to do. It simply requires keeping records of how data was created and where that data has been used. The new data world will create a new market for existing and expanded data lineage products and services. (Location 3269)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I expect that the royalty payments for our part in derived data will be less than naturally occurring data, but we will be paid, nonetheless. (Location 3310)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Synthetic data is created from our view of the world. We do not use existing data in the creation of synthetic data, we simply generate the data that we believe we need. (Location 3313)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Much of the synthetic data created today is created by using algorithms. Originally, we would create the data by hand from copying and extending data that we knew was close to or approximates the raw data. (Location 3324)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When I am executing consulting work, I ask for the rights to the simulation data, and most people are happy to sign those rights over to my consulting firm. If I am employed at a full-time job and I oversee this type of work, I ensure that all the (Location 3348)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>most data that is created soon will be created without any human intervention. The data will be created in machine-to-machine interfaces and the data will be created, stored, managed, used, and analyzed without any humans being in the loop. (Location 3377)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Earlier I remarked that I did not view the early stages of the analytics continuum as true analytics, I still hold this to be true, but I wanted to include these early stages for clarity as to where the analytics continuum begins. (Location 3399)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prescriptive models prescribe the actions that business executives, managers and subject matter experts should take. (Location 3431)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Based on the data used in the prediction/prescription efforts, data science teams build simulation systems that enable business users to vary their assumptions and plans. The simulation system is run many times to see which of their plans, ideas and visions produce the best business outcomes. (Location 3437)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>simulation environments enable business managers to gain confidence that they are seeing the projected performance of markets, companies, products, and customers in a safe environment. Business managers can try sets of plans and variables that they have seen before in real world markets. They can validate the models are producing accurate results and empower business users to create new and interesting scenarios delivering a competitive advantage. (Location 3444)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Digital Twins[5] are an area of simulation that is widely used and has provided significant benefits to organizations around the world. (Location 3450)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Optimization models and applications build on all the preceding levels of data and analytics sophistication that we have discussed. (Location 3453)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Optimization models and applications analyze the billions and trillions of simulations and recommend the best course of action that is aligned with the business outcomes and objectives stated as the best outcome by the business executives, managers and subject matter experts. (Location 3459)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data scientists are innovators, creators of change, drivers of transformation. We do not want statisticians to be data scientists, and the reverse is true as well. There are roles for both and we need and want both, but let’s not confuse the two. (Location 3486)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not hire a data scientist to execute purely statistical work and do not hire a statistician to be a data scientist. (Location 3487)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As with most changes in the world, data won’t change in a big bang. Not all factors will change in an instant. The world at large; laws, regulations, enforcement, business operations, attitudes and compliance does not change in the blink of an eye. (Location 3561)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>· The current trend in consumer sentiment against being tracked, targeted, and messaged to with irrelevant offers, messages, and divisive content will continue to be of concern to a significant portion of the population. (Location 3634)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DIs will have access to data from millions of people, the DIs will constantly analyze the data, to glean insights on sources of demand, price points, access frequency, industries, and companies. If the laws around the world follow the EU model, DIs will be prohibited from selling data. (Location 3827)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since they can’t sell data, they will be committed to their goal of making your data accessible, usable, valuable, and easy to leverage by you and the companies that want to use our data in their commercial efforts. (Location 3830)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DIs will be able to tell you which groups and categories of data are in demand and the market price that is being paid for that data. (Location 3833)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Integrating your data into larger groups can be done within your data sets. Combining your purchase data category with your browsing data category, would be a common integration. Integrating your in-store grocery purchases with your online grocery purchases would provide a complete wallet share of your grocery spending. Integrating data can be done with data of other people who have similar and/or dissimilar habits, lifestyles or economic status and can be done in many ways using the following dimensions (Location 3849)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As we have been discussing, you will be managing your data through your relationship with a DI. You will have several objectives and goals that help you align the deployment and use of your data with your values. If you are concerned about global warming, you can make your data or any subset of your data available to firms that support improving the global climate on very advantageous terms, you might even be able to pay those firms for using your data.

&lt;li>Data is very different from the traditional commodities that we are accustomed to, it doesn’t wear out, it gets more valuable as you accumulate it, it can be integrated in unlimited ways, it is easily transported around the world with almost no cost, and it has unique scarcity/abundance properties. For all these reasons, the view we need to take on monetizing data is different than if we were thinking about gold, oil, cash, or diamonds. (Location 3903)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Doug Laney[12] has written the definitive book on understanding the underlying economics of data. The book is called, Infonomics[13]. (Location 3906)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your economic status will play a part in the value placed on your data in the open market. People who buy and spend more and in greater amounts will probably be paid more than those who buy and spend less in lesser amounts, but that is from a purely commercial perspective. (Location 3932)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your health status will play a part in valuing your data. People who have rare diseases or highly unusual blood types or disorders may be able to demand a premium price for their diagnostic, prescription history, medical records and genetic material and sequencing. (Location 3934)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“What if Facebook was an equitable business partner that shared half of its profit with those of us who actually provide the data that makes its business model run? Using my math (which is, again, open to debate), the average Facebook user would earn $10.77 per quarter. But, what if you are a more active user than average? Twice as active? Five times as active? Out of curiosity, I broke the numbers down below. · Half as active: $5.38 · Twice as active: $21.53 · Five times as active: $53.83 (Location 3942)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I believe, and I could be way off in my estimate of the annual data dividend, but in my view, there could be people who make over $20,000 to $50,000 or more each year from licensing their personal data. (Location 3954)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take note of the word licensing. You will not sell your data to companies; you will license it. You will retain ownership of the data and you will provide a limited use license to your data. (Location 3956)

If you are involved with such a company, stop using their service, delete all your data, tell all your friends to stop using the platform. (Location 3991)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Second, sign up for every “do not mail” list that you can. It doesn’t take long, and it really works. Most of our discussions have been about online data and that is the most important category, but companies still mail a significant amount of material and the lists and data being held by those companies is significant, and those companies are the most aggressive resellers of your data.

&lt;li>I feel that it is imperative for the people who will read this book to be aware of the massive, latent amount of economic value that will be created through the new world of data and that the economic value should be more evenly distributed, (Location 4037)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Data for All is written to be an accessible book that is easy to read for the general population. (Location 14)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>digital data is a ubiquitous element in our lives. (Location 51)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The best we can do is be armed with knowledge, understand the possible ramifications of our actions, the implications of the length of the life of the data we are creating each and every minute of every day, the potential for misuse and abuse of the information and data once it is beyond our grasp and control. (Location 91)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each of us is responsible for our data and for the lifecycle of our data. Whether we have ever thought about it or not, it is up to us to take control of our data and to actively make conscious choices (Location 101)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>today. The data ecosystem was never intended to become what it is today. That is because the data ecosystem has organically and rapidly evolved over the past 30 years in a globally distributed manner due to the independent actions of corporations, (Location 112)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>These millions of entities are acting on their own best, narrowly defined, interests. No one is driving the bus, and that needs to change. (Location 114)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the company HAD met the legal burden, but in the end, it is DNA data. DNA data, at least a complete genome, is the ultimate personal identifier, isn’t it? It is impossible to truly deidentify your complete genome. (Location 134)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>So when you sign up for a service and provide your swab with your DNA sample, the control of your resulting data is not with the DNA firm you signed up with. The policies they originally posted mean little to nothing and can be changed at any time sometimes without notice to you. In (Location 154)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“[The] first rule of data: once you hand it over, you lose control of it. You have no idea how the terms of service will change for your ‘recreational’ DNA sample,”[5] (Location 162)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The work of Arthur and his company sounds interesting and innovative for the early 1920s and it was, but the important item for us to consider is that over time, the ACNielsen company convinced the grocery store operators to provide, at no cost, or at very low cost, to his company all of the sales records of each and every one of their stores. (Location 181)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The next evolution of the industry included the first generation of data brokers like InfoUSA and other firms that worked predominantly in the direct mail industry. The second generation of data brokers included Experian, Acxiom, and Epsilon. These three firms are mostly known in the arena of credit scores and understanding credit worthiness of individuals. And today we have the third generation of data brokers that are focused on collecting information from on-line activities. Activities that include location data, browsing behavior, and purchasing. (Location 187)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The precedence set in this instance is that as data ownership has almost no value it can be transferred from individuals to companies without the consent of the individuals that created the data. This precedence of devaluing data and relegating data to a status of a meaningless commodity is at the core of the situation we find ourselves in today as it relates to data. (Location 194)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In 2006, Humby coined the phrase “Data is the new oil”. Michael Palmer expanded on Humby&amp;rsquo;s quote by saying, like oil, data is “valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used. Oil has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc. to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so, data must be broken down and analyzed for it to have value.”[10] (Location 212)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In 1998, Google was founded. This was one of the first instances of consumers obtaining a free online service in exchange for unfettered use of the data that the users themselves created. The (Location 218)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shortly after the creation and release of the Google service, the founders reacted in a spectacularly unimaginative manner by deciding that their business model would be advertising based. Technologically, Google is an interesting company, but from a business model perspective, they are about as dull as dishwater because venture capitalists and financial analysts prefer stability and predictability in business operations. (Location 230)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ACNielsen founded his firm 70 years ago by gaining free access to sales data to analyze how to sell more groceries to people through more targeted, and refined pricing, better store assortments, and improved shelf space optimization. That ultimately led to targeting of radio and television advertising/ Today we are offered virtually the same thing on our computers over the internet with very little to no change in the underlying premise. (Location 233)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To them, we remain THE commodity to be sold, through our data. (Location 237)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The rights of individuals to own, protect, manage, and monetize their data has been usurped by a past that has little to no relevance to the data ecosystem we have today. (Location 246)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Companies around the world have acted like they own our data. That is not true and is only a temporary situation that will change in the near future. (Location 247)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Haugen leaked one Facebook study that found that 13.5% of U.K. teen girls in one survey say their suicidal thoughts became more frequent after starting on Instagram. Another leaked study found 17% of teen girls say their eating disorders got worse after using Instagram.”[19]About 32% of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse, Facebook&amp;rsquo;s researchers found, which was first reported by the Journal. (Location 274)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The early founders of the data and analytics industry like Arthur Nielsen, Danny Moore, Wayne Levy, moved slowly at first, seeking to make money by selling insights on how to sell more household consumable goods. In the 90’s, analytics professionals were very careful to work on analytics that would help understand buyer behavior, assiduously avoiding unethical use cases. (Location 284)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>our individual data is not that valuable and that it is like sand, ubiquitous and requiring much processing to make it valuable to firms and ultimately to us in the form of targeted messaging and advertising. (Location 313)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Data is the New Sun is a more relevant analogy&amp;hellip; as the sun can power an infinite number of uses at zero marginal cost, never wears out (or depreciates) and never depletes! At its heart, digital transformation is about economics: transitioning from yesterday’s “economics of oil” mentality (expensive to find, expensive to extract, expensive to transport, environmentally hazardous, depletes, messy, dirty, and environmental costly) to embracing the modern “economics of the sun” (clean, never depletes, never depreciates and is readily available to fuel an infinite number of uses).”[23] (Location 326)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“The most valuable asset of Uber, the ride-hailing service&amp;hellip; is the data of the people who use it. The prime asset of Google, the largest library, which owns no physical library, is the index that takes customers to their desired websites. Therefore, the new valuable asset is not gold, but it is data. Data has become the new gold!”[24] The professor’s logic and arguments are solid and based in reality, but I do think they are limited in past historical thinking and are too limiting to the prospects of data. (Location 334)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data exchanges, like stock exchanges, are where people and companies will congregate, virtually, to offer, buy and sell data in an open market. (Location 349)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>data as “the new plastic”, because “we create a lot, we struggle to know what to do with it and it tends to turn up in the wrong places. And, for all the talk about the democratization of data, business is not yet culturally geared up to handle this. There’s a lot to do.”[27] (Location 356)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The characteristics of the sun and data are closely aligned in a physical and metaphorical sense. (Location 371)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People should be allowed to take an active part in the management/control, use, and monetization of their data. Today, individuals can engage in this process but it is disjointed, complicated, time consuming, and most people do not see the value in engaging the current process to limit and control their data. (Location 381)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Forward thinking governments have started to discuss the creation and regulation of data exchanges and data commons.[31] Companies will follow with offerings and capabilities where it will be simple for every person to make choices about the use of their data. These companies will make money from enabling individuals in the process of proactively managing, controlling, sharing, monetizing their data. (Location 386)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An informed population can and will make better decisions that can affect social change with this book and these ideas. (Location 393)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In western democracies, the idea of some all-knowing Big Brother is a fiction, no matter what some politicians tell you. The real problem is commercial companies, specifically the younger, more intelligent companies, (Location 566)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>“Companies target me with offers and stories that I am not interested in. Therefore, they can’t be doing much with my data given how bad they are at understanding me and my true interests.” What individuals are missing is that companies are not good at understanding the difference between tangential and core interests today, but they are getting better and will get much better in the future. (Location 653)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is important that we are clear that collecting data of all types and analyzing with ever increasing accuracy and speed is the goal of nearly all companies and will remain so for the foreseeable future. We cannot be complacent about the current lack of abilities (Location 658)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The most impressive firms and data science teams know and understand that the goal in all data collection efforts is to collect enough multi-faceted data about any person, behavior, or situation to be able to analyze, model, predict, prescribe, simulate, and optimize that situation to the interests of the parties executing the collecting and modeling activities. (Location 717)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The point is that the “free” services are not free. You are paying for them with your data and your agreement to allow these firms to observe, examine, aggregate, analyze, target, and sell you as a commodity. (Location 812)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“This new digital economy is described in a variety of ways: as a cognitive capitalism, where a systematic process of privatization of information in different forms allows for maximization of profits (Bauwens et al., 2019; Fumagalli et al., 2019), as a data colonialism, in which data is used to subjugate and transform social relations (Couldry &amp;amp; Mejias, 2019), or as a form of surveillance capitalism, in which various technological apparatuses monitor humans and try to predict and control human behavior for the sake of profit (Zuboff, 2019). (Location 841)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Those who do not have the luxury of considering the implications of sharing their data; those who live in poverty or make just enough to get by; those that are rarely in a position to worry about what is being done with their data. (Location 1023)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The goal here is moving people on the margin toward being aware, interested, caring, and actively engaged in understanding and acting on topics related to their data. (Location 1082)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since you own your data, you have the full rights and abilities to grant or revoke a limited use license for your data. (Location 1115)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can, in the future, revoke their right to use your data. That is the first step that GDPR has taken in relation to data owned by EU citizens. (Location 1117)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What if you don’t like how airline companies are contributing to climate change? You set the price of the use of your data for any airline to access and use your data in their operations, marketing and analytics efforts at 100 times, or a 1,000 times, or a million times the price that you would charge to a company that is involved in organic and sustainable farming, (Location 1129)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children are being given electronic devices to distract them at younger and younger ages. These children are creating data and that data is being used to create new interfaces, new games, new modes of engagement; all of which are highly addictive. (Location 1157)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We asked how much the game cost. They responded that it was free. We explained that it did not cost them money to play the game, but that the game was not free. They asked what we meant. We went on to explain that they gave their name, age, e-mail address, location, and player activity to the company in order to play the game. (Location 1169)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We taught our children to think about their choices critically and proactively. That is all a parent can do. We should all be doing this with every child that we are responsible and accountable for. (Location 1194)

&lt;li>Personally, managing and monetizing your data is not possible today, but it will be in the coming years. (Location 1214)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most people in the world do not have a stream or streams of passive income. “Passive income includes regular earnings from a source other than an employer or contractor. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says passive income can come from two sources: rental property or a business in which one does not actively participate, such as being paid book royalties or stock dividends,”[25] or a data dividend. Think about how nice that will be. Money for doing the things that you were going to do anyway and a stream of money that keeps coming each new week, month, or year. (Location 1217)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data monetization stems from the concept of ownership of data held by the individuals that have created and are creating the data. (Location 1224)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The laws that are being drafted now envision that each person will be able to access the entire universe of their data and be able to set usage conditions and rules, monetary terms for each data element, date ranges of where data can used and where it cannot be used, exclusion lists of companies that cannot use your data, inclusion lists of preferred companies that can use your data as you have designated on preferred terms. (Location 1227)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You should be getting paid for the data you create on a regular and on-going basis, not the management teams of some random companies. (Location 1235)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What they do care about is corporate performance and growth, typically denominated in monetary terms. Yes, they all talk about products and services and helping the world, but it really comes down to the performance metrics around revenue. (Location 1242)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The data you create is yours and the revenue stream from that data should be yours. (Location 1243)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>data or information has the following unique characteristics: · Is nonrivalrous · Is nondepleting · Is regenerative and nearly unlimited · Has relatively low inventory costs and transportation/transmission costs · Is more difficult to control and own · Is ecofriendly · If you spill it, you can’t clean it up[28] Data is truly and radically different than other commodities that the world has known in the past and should be treated in new and substantially different ways. (Location 1277)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Typically, in the UK people trust the government and don’t trust [the tech] industry, and in the US people trust industry and don’t trust the government,” he says. More should be done to assuage fears about how tech giants handle user data, he adds. “To an extent, it’s how people are brought up and therefore cultural. But for people in the UK to trust these large American companies then you need to have serious legislation and regulation.”[32] (Location 1302)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The economic, social, monetary, and societal value of data will be more evenly distributed across societies, groups, and individuals. Understand, know and become a part of this movement. Talk about it at social gatherings. Post on social media. Talk with your professional colleagues who are involved in the lifecycle of any and all data. Reach out to your elected government officials and tell them that legislation related to data and your rights needs to be a priority, because (Location 1311)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>One of the goals of these programs is slow or stop change that enables individuals to access, manage, and monetize their data. These lobbying efforts and associated proposals are very well designed, funded, planned, and are being executed in an orchestrated manner that is designed counter to improving access to data.

&lt;li>When I was an adolescent it seemed the majority of people trusted our system of government or democracy; the US government, the media, our schools, and most of the institutions that make up American society to do what is in the best interest of we as individuals, the country, and the world. This was one aspect of what was referred to as American Exceptionalism.[4] (Location 1540)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Internet companies, by contrast, got an exemption in the now-notorious Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which says content created by users is not the responsibility of web platforms. (Location 1677)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I believe that our data has the same type of intrinsic value and that we should be paid each and every time a data element that we have created is used. Perhaps we are paid a millionth of a penny, or perhaps we set the rate for what we are paid by the type of organization that wants to use our data. We will delve into this topic more deeply later in the book, but I wanted to make the comparison to music royalties (Location 1779)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>our data has value, we should be paid when our data is used in a manner that delivers revenue and profit to any commercial organization. (Location 1782)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The concept is being discussed today and one name that is used to refer to the idea in practice is a data dividend. How would you like to get a check each month or every year for the use of your data? (Location 1784)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I believe individuals should be empowered to and should be able to easily set the price of our data used in each industry, company, and application. (Location 1786)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“The public sphere needs an ‘ecosystem of trust’ which could set out objectives of re-usage of data for the common good while protecting individual rights&amp;hellip; related to data, asserting that the systemic level of data assemblage must be re-conceptualized to reject the data-as-a-commodity view and take public interest into consideration. For data stewardship to achieve its goals, it is necessary to consider the inherent properties of data as commons&amp;hellip; framework&amp;hellip;.[A] public data commons as the model that is best suited to secure European rights and values while increasing data sharing at the same time.”[27] (Location 1838)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Data Governance Act is a single step toward creating data commons that will collect data with the express purpose of using that data for public good and the good of everyone involved and not in just some conceptual manner, but in a tangible monetary manner for each EU citizen. (Location 1857)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Data Act will be a major new initiative to ensure fairness by providing better control for data sharing to citizens and businesses. [Through the Data] Act, users will have more control over the data they generate via their smart objects and EU businesses more possibilities to compete and innovate and easily transfer data between service providers. The Data Act will aim at clarifying for EU consumers and businesses who can use and access what data for which purposes. (Location 1861)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One portion of the Data Governance Act (DGA) that is noteworthy are the clauses which outline the creation of Data Intermediaries (DI) also known as data cooperatives or data unions.[30] These are the institutions, organizations and frameworks that will enable citizens, EU citizens in the beginning, to take control of their data to move, aggregate, share and monetize the data as they wish. (Location 1869)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The overall level of trust granted these organizations by the general public is at an all-time low. These organizations are actively perpetuating a system the source of significant and valuable raw material, the users. We do not tolerate companies that egregiously exploit natural resources for the gain of a few. We should not tolerate the same abuse of our data going forward. (Location 2024)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Privacy relates to freedom of choice and control in the sphere of one’s personal information– choices regarding what information you wish to share and, perhaps more important, what you do not want shared with others. (Location 2255)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some defend privacy as focusing on control over information about oneself (Parent, 1983), while others defend it as a broader concept required for human dignity (Bloustein, 1964), or crucial for intimacy (Gerstein, 1978; Inness, 1992). Other commentators defend privacy as necessary for the development of varied and meaningful interpersonal relationships (Location 2269)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Think about the activities where you seek privacy and the motivating factors for why you seek it. Now overlay those activities with your online activities. Where is the intersection of your desire for privacy and your online activities? Would you want more control to access, modify or delete data related to those activities? Would you want to charge companies more money to access your data related to those activities, or would you prefer to block all companies from accessing that data? (Location 2299)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>appears that privacy exhibits many of the characteristics of sleep. (Location 2331)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Privacy and secrecy are often confused. (Location 2340)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Privacy is consensual where secrecy is not; that is, there is a “right to privacy” but no equivalent “right to secrecy.” Those stigmatized or disadvantaged social groups who have little or no access to privacy utilize secrecy to conceal their behavior.”[23] (Location 2342)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When people know they are deprived of the right of privacy they will feel anxious, nervous, and worried about concealing data and information that may disadvantage them or their loved ones, colleagues, or compatriots. (Location 2348)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Privacy enables people to withdraw information, and/or their physical self, from the public view. (Location 2363)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People talk about and profess that they want a high degree of privacy, but then they regularly act in ways that actively reduces or eliminates the degree of privacy that they actually have. It is a paradox, (Location 2387)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Large, complex organizations use data-sharing platforms to facilitate collaboration on data-driven projects, both within and between organizations. (Location 2744)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“It was long unanimously held among economists that natural resources that were collectively used by their users would be over-exploited and destroyed in the long-term. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters, and forests. She showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.”[9] (Location 2830)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Her work created a new understanding of the actual delineation between common resources and private property. She and her colleagues clarified and codified how organically organized groups optimized the management of common resources for long term sustainability in opposition to the previously held theory that all common pool resources would be exploited, depleted, and most likely destroyed. (Location 2843)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From the work of Elinor Ostrom, and others, the advocates of Open Data and Open Software extended her research, findings and insights from forestry, irrigation, and policing systems to the new worlds of data and software. (Location 2849)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knowledge is open if anyone is free to access, use, modify, and share it— subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness.”[14] (Location 2860)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open Data evolved in conjunction and in parallel with the concept of Open-Source Software (Location 2874)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The OKF is a not-for-profit organization that works to communicate, train and bring about the use of open data on a global basis. The mission of the OKF is, “to create a more open world– a world where all non-personal information is open, free for everyone to use, build on and share; and creators and innovators are fairly recognized and rewarded.”[19] It is worthwhile to note that the OKF’s mission exempts personal information from their definition of open. (Location 2893)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open Data is an economic imperative that can drive a level of value generation such that it can be a driving force in lifting sections of populations and younger generations out of poverty. Open Data needs to be ubiquitous across all governments and all relevant data, and it will be in the coming years. (Location 2948)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Data exchanges are emerging as a key component of the data economy. By connecting data suppliers and consumers through a seamless experience, data exchanges have created a modern-day gold rush to help modern, digital organizations address their insatiable hunger for data. And, by eliminating the friction from finding, acquiring, and integrating data, these exchanges make it easy for any company to monetize its data assets and create new revenue streams.”[27] (Location 2971)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Shanghai Data Exchange was established to address the major difficulties in data trading including identification of data ownership, pricing of data, reaching mutual trust between transaction parties, initiating transactions and overall supervision, said local authorities.[30] (Location 2982)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>

&lt;li>Data Marketplace - A data marketplace is a public data exchange open to any company that wants to supply or consume data. Some marketplaces are global in scope, spanning every industry, function, and type of data.[31] (Location 2994)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Data intermediation services would include&amp;hellip; data pools established jointly by several legal or natural persons with the intention to license the use of such a pool to all interested parties in a manner that all participants contributing to the pool would receive a reward for their contribution to the pool.”[32] (Location 3008)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One company that is working toward creating data unions that can be managed in a unified and consistent manner is Pooldata.io.[34] (Location 3027)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data lineage is the same as your genealogical lineage. When new data is created from existing data; or generated from raw, aggregated, or other natural source of data, the new data has a lineage— a connection to the source or original data. (Location 3258)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tracking data lineage is not hard to do. It simply requires keeping records of how data was created and where that data has been used. The new data world will create a new market for existing and expanded data lineage products and services. (Location 3269)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I expect that the royalty payments for our part in derived data will be less than naturally occurring data, but we will be paid, nonetheless. (Location 3310)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Synthetic data is created from our view of the world. We do not use existing data in the creation of synthetic data, we simply generate the data that we believe we need. (Location 3313)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Much of the synthetic data created today is created by using algorithms. Originally, we would create the data by hand from copying and extending data that we knew was close to or approximates the raw data. (Location 3324)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When I am executing consulting work, I ask for the rights to the simulation data, and most people are happy to sign those rights over to my consulting firm. If I am employed at a full-time job and I oversee this type of work, I ensure that all the (Location 3348)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>most data that is created soon will be created without any human intervention. The data will be created in machine-to-machine interfaces and the data will be created, stored, managed, used, and analyzed without any humans being in the loop. (Location 3377)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Earlier I remarked that I did not view the early stages of the analytics continuum as true analytics, I still hold this to be true, but I wanted to include these early stages for clarity as to where the analytics continuum begins. (Location 3399)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prescriptive models prescribe the actions that business executives, managers and subject matter experts should take. (Location 3431)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Based on the data used in the prediction/prescription efforts, data science teams build simulation systems that enable business users to vary their assumptions and plans. The simulation system is run many times to see which of their plans, ideas and visions produce the best business outcomes. (Location 3437)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>simulation environments enable business managers to gain confidence that they are seeing the projected performance of markets, companies, products, and customers in a safe environment. Business managers can try sets of plans and variables that they have seen before in real world markets. They can validate the models are producing accurate results and empower business users to create new and interesting scenarios delivering a competitive advantage. (Location 3444)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Digital Twins[5] are an area of simulation that is widely used and has provided significant benefits to organizations around the world. (Location 3450)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Optimization models and applications build on all the preceding levels of data and analytics sophistication that we have discussed. (Location 3453)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Optimization models and applications analyze the billions and trillions of simulations and recommend the best course of action that is aligned with the business outcomes and objectives stated as the best outcome by the business executives, managers and subject matter experts. (Location 3459)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data scientists are innovators, creators of change, drivers of transformation. We do not want statisticians to be data scientists, and the reverse is true as well. There are roles for both and we need and want both, but let’s not confuse the two. (Location 3486)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not hire a data scientist to execute purely statistical work and do not hire a statistician to be a data scientist. (Location 3487)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As with most changes in the world, data won’t change in a big bang. Not all factors will change in an instant. The world at large; laws, regulations, enforcement, business operations, attitudes and compliance does not change in the blink of an eye. (Location 3561)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>· The current trend in consumer sentiment against being tracked, targeted, and messaged to with irrelevant offers, messages, and divisive content will continue to be of concern to a significant portion of the population. (Location 3634)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DIs will have access to data from millions of people, the DIs will constantly analyze the data, to glean insights on sources of demand, price points, access frequency, industries, and companies. If the laws around the world follow the EU model, DIs will be prohibited from selling data. (Location 3827)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since they can’t sell data, they will be committed to their goal of making your data accessible, usable, valuable, and easy to leverage by you and the companies that want to use our data in their commercial efforts. (Location 3830)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DIs will be able to tell you which groups and categories of data are in demand and the market price that is being paid for that data. (Location 3833)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Integrating your data into larger groups can be done within your data sets. Combining your purchase data category with your browsing data category, would be a common integration. Integrating your in-store grocery purchases with your online grocery purchases would provide a complete wallet share of your grocery spending. Integrating data can be done with data of other people who have similar and/or dissimilar habits, lifestyles or economic status and can be done in many ways using the following dimensions (Location 3849)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As we have been discussing, you will be managing your data through your relationship with a DI. You will have several objectives and goals that help you align the deployment and use of your data with your values. If you are concerned about global warming, you can make your data or any subset of your data available to firms that support improving the global climate on very advantageous terms, you might even be able to pay those firms for using your data.

&lt;li>Data is very different from the traditional commodities that we are accustomed to, it doesn’t wear out, it gets more valuable as you accumulate it, it can be integrated in unlimited ways, it is easily transported around the world with almost no cost, and it has unique scarcity/abundance properties. For all these reasons, the view we need to take on monetizing data is different than if we were thinking about gold, oil, cash, or diamonds. (Location 3903)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Doug Laney[12] has written the definitive book on understanding the underlying economics of data. The book is called, Infonomics[13]. (Location 3906)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your economic status will play a part in the value placed on your data in the open market. People who buy and spend more and in greater amounts will probably be paid more than those who buy and spend less in lesser amounts, but that is from a purely commercial perspective. (Location 3932)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your health status will play a part in valuing your data. People who have rare diseases or highly unusual blood types or disorders may be able to demand a premium price for their diagnostic, prescription history, medical records and genetic material and sequencing. (Location 3934)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“What if Facebook was an equitable business partner that shared half of its profit with those of us who actually provide the data that makes its business model run? Using my math (which is, again, open to debate), the average Facebook user would earn $10.77 per quarter. But, what if you are a more active user than average? Twice as active? Five times as active? Out of curiosity, I broke the numbers down below. · Half as active: $5.38 · Twice as active: $21.53 · Five times as active: $53.83 (Location 3942)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I believe, and I could be way off in my estimate of the annual data dividend, but in my view, there could be people who make over $20,000 to $50,000 or more each year from licensing their personal data. (Location 3954)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take note of the word licensing. You will not sell your data to companies; you will license it. You will retain ownership of the data and you will provide a limited use license to your data. (Location 3956)

If you are involved with such a company, stop using their service, delete all your data, tell all your friends to stop using the platform. (Location 3991)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Second, sign up for every “do not mail” list that you can. It doesn’t take long, and it really works. Most of our discussions have been about online data and that is the most important category, but companies still mail a significant amount of material and the lists and data being held by those companies is significant, and those companies are the most aggressive resellers of your data.

&lt;li>Data for All is written to be an accessible book that is easy to read for the general population. (Location 14)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>digital data is a ubiquitous element in our lives. (Location 51)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The best we can do is be armed with knowledge, understand the possible ramifications of our actions, the implications of the length of the life of the data we are creating each and every minute of every day, the potential for misuse and abuse of the information and data once it is beyond our grasp and control. (Location 91)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each of us is responsible for our data and for the lifecycle of our data. Whether we have ever thought about it or not, it is up to us to take control of our data and to actively make conscious choices (Location 101)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>today. The data ecosystem was never intended to become what it is today. That is because the data ecosystem has organically and rapidly evolved over the past 30 years in a globally distributed manner due to the independent actions of corporations, (Location 112)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>These millions of entities are acting on their own best, narrowly defined, interests. No one is driving the bus, and that needs to change. (Location 114)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the company HAD met the legal burden, but in the end, it is DNA data. DNA data, at least a complete genome, is the ultimate personal identifier, isn’t it? It is impossible to truly deidentify your complete genome. (Location 134)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>So when you sign up for a service and provide your swab with your DNA sample, the control of your resulting data is not with the DNA firm you signed up with. The policies they originally posted mean little to nothing and can be changed at any time sometimes without notice to you. In (Location 154)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>The work of Arthur and his company sounds interesting and innovative for the early 1920s and it was, but the important item for us to consider is that over time, the ACNielsen company convinced the grocery store operators to provide, at no cost, or at very low cost, to his company all of the sales records of each and every one of their stores. (Location 181)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The next evolution of the industry included the first generation of data brokers like InfoUSA and other firms that worked predominantly in the direct mail industry. The second generation of data brokers included Experian, Acxiom, and Epsilon. These three firms are mostly known in the arena of credit scores and understanding credit worthiness of individuals. And today we have the third generation of data brokers that are focused on collecting information from on-line activities. Activities that include location data, browsing behavior, and purchasing. (Location 187)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The precedence set in this instance is that as data ownership has almost no value it can be transferred from individuals to companies without the consent of the individuals that created the data. This precedence of devaluing data and relegating data to a status of a meaningless commodity is at the core of the situation we find ourselves in today as it relates to data. (Location 194)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In 2006, Humby coined the phrase “Data is the new oil”. Michael Palmer expanded on Humby&amp;rsquo;s quote by saying, like oil, data is “valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used. Oil has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc. to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so, data must be broken down and analyzed for it to have value.”[10] (Location 212)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In 1998, Google was founded. This was one of the first instances of consumers obtaining a free online service in exchange for unfettered use of the data that the users themselves created. The (Location 218)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shortly after the creation and release of the Google service, the founders reacted in a spectacularly unimaginative manner by deciding that their business model would be advertising based. Technologically, Google is an interesting company, but from a business model perspective, they are about as dull as dishwater because venture capitalists and financial analysts prefer stability and predictability in business operations. (Location 230)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ACNielsen founded his firm 70 years ago by gaining free access to sales data to analyze how to sell more groceries to people through more targeted, and refined pricing, better store assortments, and improved shelf space optimization. That ultimately led to targeting of radio and television advertising/ Today we are offered virtually the same thing on our computers over the internet with very little to no change in the underlying premise. (Location 233)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To them, we remain THE commodity to be sold, through our data. (Location 237)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The rights of individuals to own, protect, manage, and monetize their data has been usurped by a past that has little to no relevance to the data ecosystem we have today. (Location 246)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Companies around the world have acted like they own our data. That is not true and is only a temporary situation that will change in the near future. (Location 247)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Haugen leaked one Facebook study that found that 13.5% of U.K. teen girls in one survey say their suicidal thoughts became more frequent after starting on Instagram. Another leaked study found 17% of teen girls say their eating disorders got worse after using Instagram.”[19]About 32% of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse, Facebook&amp;rsquo;s researchers found, which was first reported by the Journal. (Location 274)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The early founders of the data and analytics industry like Arthur Nielsen, Danny Moore, Wayne Levy, moved slowly at first, seeking to make money by selling insights on how to sell more household consumable goods. In the 90’s, analytics professionals were very careful to work on analytics that would help understand buyer behavior, assiduously avoiding unethical use cases. (Location 284)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>our individual data is not that valuable and that it is like sand, ubiquitous and requiring much processing to make it valuable to firms and ultimately to us in the form of targeted messaging and advertising. (Location 313)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Data is the New Sun is a more relevant analogy&amp;hellip; as the sun can power an infinite number of uses at zero marginal cost, never wears out (or depreciates) and never depletes! At its heart, digital transformation is about economics: transitioning from yesterday’s “economics of oil” mentality (expensive to find, expensive to extract, expensive to transport, environmentally hazardous, depletes, messy, dirty, and environmental costly) to embracing the modern “economics of the sun” (clean, never depletes, never depreciates and is readily available to fuel an infinite number of uses).”[23] (Location 326)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“The most valuable asset of Uber, the ride-hailing service&amp;hellip; is the data of the people who use it. The prime asset of Google, the largest library, which owns no physical library, is the index that takes customers to their desired websites. Therefore, the new valuable asset is not gold, but it is data. Data has become the new gold!”[24] The professor’s logic and arguments are solid and based in reality, but I do think they are limited in past historical thinking and are too limiting to the prospects of data. (Location 334)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data exchanges, like stock exchanges, are where people and companies will congregate, virtually, to offer, buy and sell data in an open market. (Location 349)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>data as “the new plastic”, because “we create a lot, we struggle to know what to do with it and it tends to turn up in the wrong places. And, for all the talk about the democratization of data, business is not yet culturally geared up to handle this. There’s a lot to do.”[27] (Location 356)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The characteristics of the sun and data are closely aligned in a physical and metaphorical sense. (Location 371)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People should be allowed to take an active part in the management/control, use, and monetization of their data. Today, individuals can engage in this process but it is disjointed, complicated, time consuming, and most people do not see the value in engaging the current process to limit and control their data. (Location 381)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Forward thinking governments have started to discuss the creation and regulation of data exchanges and data commons.[31] Companies will follow with offerings and capabilities where it will be simple for every person to make choices about the use of their data. These companies will make money from enabling individuals in the process of proactively managing, controlling, sharing, monetizing their data. (Location 386)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An informed population can and will make better decisions that can affect social change with this book and these ideas. (Location 393)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>“Companies target me with offers and stories that I am not interested in. Therefore, they can’t be doing much with my data given how bad they are at understanding me and my true interests.” What individuals are missing is that companies are not good at understanding the difference between tangential and core interests today, but they are getting better and will get much better in the future. (Location 653)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is important that we are clear that collecting data of all types and analyzing with ever increasing accuracy and speed is the goal of nearly all companies and will remain so for the foreseeable future. We cannot be complacent about the current lack of abilities (Location 658)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The most impressive firms and data science teams know and understand that the goal in all data collection efforts is to collect enough multi-faceted data about any person, behavior, or situation to be able to analyze, model, predict, prescribe, simulate, and optimize that situation to the interests of the parties executing the collecting and modeling activities.

&lt;li>The point is that the “free” services are not free. You are paying for them with your data and your agreement to allow these firms to observe, examine, aggregate, analyze, target, and sell you as a commodity. (Location 812)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“This new digital economy is described in a variety of ways: as a cognitive capitalism, where a systematic process of privatization of information in different forms allows for maximization of profits (Bauwens et al., 2019; Fumagalli et al., 2019), as a data colonialism, in which data is used to subjugate and transform social relations (Couldry &amp;amp; Mejias, 2019), or as a form of surveillance capitalism, in which various technological apparatuses monitor humans and try to predict and control human behavior for the sake of profit (Zuboff, 2019). (Location 841)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Those who do not have the luxury of considering the implications of sharing their data; those who live in poverty or make just enough to get by; those that are rarely in a position to worry about what is being done with their data. (Location 1023)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The goal here is moving people on the margin toward being aware, interested, caring, and actively engaged in understanding and acting on topics related to their data. (Location 1082)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since you own your data, you have the full rights and abilities to grant or revoke a limited use license for your data. (Location 1115)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can, in the future, revoke their right to use your data. That is the first step that GDPR has taken in relation to data owned by EU citizens. (Location 1117)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What if you don’t like how airline companies are contributing to climate change? You set the price of the use of your data for any airline to access and use your data in their operations, marketing and analytics efforts at 100 times, or a 1,000 times, or a million times the price that you would charge to a company that is involved in organic and sustainable farming, (Location 1129)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children are being given electronic devices to distract them at younger and younger ages. These children are creating data and that data is being used to create new interfaces, new games, new modes of engagement; all of which are highly addictive. (Location 1157)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We asked how much the game cost. They responded that it was free. We explained that it did not cost them money to play the game, but that the game was not free. They asked what we meant. We went on to explain that they gave their name, age, e-mail address, location, and player activity to the company in order to play the game. (Location 1169)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We taught our children to think about their choices critically and proactively. That is all a parent can do. We should all be doing this with every child that we are responsible and accountable for. (Location 1194)

&lt;li>Personally, managing and monetizing your data is not possible today, but it will be in the coming years. (Location 1214)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most people in the world do not have a stream or streams of passive income. “Passive income includes regular earnings from a source other than an employer or contractor. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says passive income can come from two sources: rental property or a business in which one does not actively participate, such as being paid book royalties or stock dividends,”[25] or a data dividend. Think about how nice that will be. Money for doing the things that you were going to do anyway and a stream of money that keeps coming each new week, month, or year. (Location 1217)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data monetization stems from the concept of ownership of data held by the individuals that have created and are creating the data. (Location 1224)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The laws that are being drafted now envision that each person will be able to access the entire universe of their data and be able to set usage conditions and rules, monetary terms for each data element, date ranges of where data can used and where it cannot be used, exclusion lists of companies that cannot use your data, inclusion lists of preferred companies that can use your data as you have designated on preferred terms. (Location 1227)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You should be getting paid for the data you create on a regular and on-going basis, not the management teams of some random companies. (Location 1235)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What they do care about is corporate performance and growth, typically denominated in monetary terms. Yes, they all talk about products and services and helping the world, but it really comes down to the performance metrics around revenue. (Location 1242)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The data you create is yours and the revenue stream from that data should be yours. (Location 1243)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>data or information has the following unique characteristics: · Is nonrivalrous · Is nondepleting · Is regenerative and nearly unlimited · Has relatively low inventory costs and transportation/transmission costs · Is more difficult to control and own · Is ecofriendly · If you spill it, you can’t clean it up[28] Data is truly and radically different than other commodities that the world has known in the past and should be treated in new and substantially different ways. (Location 1277)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Typically, in the UK people trust the government and don’t trust [the tech] industry, and in the US people trust industry and don’t trust the government,” he says. More should be done to assuage fears about how tech giants handle user data, he adds. “To an extent, it’s how people are brought up and therefore cultural. But for people in the UK to trust these large American companies then you need to have serious legislation and regulation.”[32] (Location 1302)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The economic, social, monetary, and societal value of data will be more evenly distributed across societies, groups, and individuals. Understand, know and become a part of this movement. Talk about it at social gatherings. Post on social media. Talk with your professional colleagues who are involved in the lifecycle of any and all data. Reach out to your elected government officials and tell them that legislation related to data and your rights needs to be a priority, because (Location 1311)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Social media does a significant amount of damage to the world by algorithmically targeting people in the developing world with messages of division. Those people would benefit the most from a data dividend. (Location 1316)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One of the goals of these programs is slow or stop change that enables individuals to access, manage, and monetize their data. These lobbying efforts and associated proposals are very well designed, funded, planned, and are being executed in an orchestrated manner that is designed counter to improving access to data. (Location 1466)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is opposition to change in the world of data from entities that profit from today&amp;rsquo;s data ecosystem. (Location 1480)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When I was an adolescent it seemed the majority of people trusted our system of government or democracy; the US government, the media, our schools, and most of the institutions that make up American society to do what is in the best interest of we as individuals, the country, and the world. This was one aspect of what was referred to as American Exceptionalism.[4] (Location 1540)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By the end of the 1970s, only about a quarter of Americans felt that they could trust the government at least most of the time.”[5] (Location 1546)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Like many Americans, Veselka’s daily life is saturated with the products and services pushed by big technology companies, paid and free. (Location 1629)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Internet companies, by contrast, got an exemption in the now-notorious Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which says content created by users is not the responsibility of web platforms. (Location 1677)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I believe that our data has the same type of intrinsic value and that we should be paid each and every time a data element that we have created is used. Perhaps we are paid a millionth of a penny, or perhaps we set the rate for what we are paid by the type of organization that wants to use our data. We will delve into this topic more deeply later in the book, but I wanted to make the comparison to music royalties (Location 1779)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>our data has value, we should be paid when our data is used in a manner that delivers revenue and profit to any commercial organization. (Location 1782)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The concept is being discussed today and one name that is used to refer to the idea in practice is a data dividend. How would you like to get a check each month or every year for the use of your data? (Location 1784)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I believe individuals should be empowered to and should be able to easily set the price of our data used in each industry, company, and application. (Location 1786)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“The public sphere needs an ‘ecosystem of trust’ which could set out objectives of re-usage of data for the common good while protecting individual rights&amp;hellip; related to data, asserting that the systemic level of data assemblage must be re-conceptualized to reject the data-as-a-commodity view and take public interest into consideration. For data stewardship to achieve its goals, it is necessary to consider the inherent properties of data as commons&amp;hellip; framework&amp;hellip;.[A] public data commons as the model that is best suited to secure European rights and values while increasing data sharing at the same time.”[27] (Location 1838)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Data Governance Act is a single step toward creating data commons that will collect data with the express purpose of using that data for public good and the good of everyone involved and not in just some conceptual manner, but in a tangible monetary manner for each EU citizen. (Location 1857)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Data Act will be a major new initiative to ensure fairness by providing better control for data sharing to citizens and businesses. [Through the Data] Act, users will have more control over the data they generate via their smart objects and EU businesses more possibilities to compete and innovate and easily transfer data between service providers. The Data Act will aim at clarifying for EU consumers and businesses who can use and access what data for which purposes. (Location 1861)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One portion of the Data Governance Act (DGA) that is noteworthy are the clauses which outline the creation of Data Intermediaries (DI) also known as data cooperatives or data unions.[30] These are the institutions, organizations and frameworks that will enable citizens, EU citizens in the beginning, to take control of their data to move, aggregate, share and monetize the data as they wish. (Location 1869)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The overall level of trust granted these organizations by the general public is at an all-time low. These organizations are actively perpetuating a system the source of significant and valuable raw material, the users. We do not tolerate companies that egregiously exploit natural resources for the gain of a few. We should not tolerate the same abuse of our data going forward. (Location 2024)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Privacy relates to freedom of choice and control in the sphere of one’s personal information– choices regarding what information you wish to share and, perhaps more important, what you do not want shared with others. (Location 2255)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some defend privacy as focusing on control over information about oneself (Parent, 1983), while others defend it as a broader concept required for human dignity (Bloustein, 1964), or crucial for intimacy (Gerstein, 1978; Inness, 1992). Other commentators defend privacy as necessary for the development of varied and meaningful interpersonal relationships (Location 2269)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Think about the activities where you seek privacy and the motivating factors for why you seek it. Now overlay those activities with your online activities. Where is the intersection of your desire for privacy and your online activities? Would you want more control to access, modify or delete data related to those activities? Would you want to charge companies more money to access your data related to those activities, or would you prefer to block all companies from accessing that data? (Location 2299)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>appears that privacy exhibits many of the characteristics of sleep. (Location 2331)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Privacy and secrecy are often confused. (Location 2340)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Privacy is consensual where secrecy is not; that is, there is a “right to privacy” but no equivalent “right to secrecy.” Those stigmatized or disadvantaged social groups who have little or no access to privacy utilize secrecy to conceal their behavior.”[23] (Location 2342)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When people know they are deprived of the right of privacy they will feel anxious, nervous, and worried about concealing data and information that may disadvantage them or their loved ones, colleagues, or compatriots. (Location 2348)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Privacy enables people to withdraw information, and/or their physical self, from the public view. (Location 2363)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People talk about and profess that they want a high degree of privacy, but then they regularly act in ways that actively reduces or eliminates the degree of privacy that they actually have. It is a paradox, (Location 2387)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Large, complex organizations use data-sharing platforms to facilitate collaboration on data-driven projects, both within and between organizations. (Location 2744)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“It was long unanimously held among economists that natural resources that were collectively used by their users would be over-exploited and destroyed in the long-term. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters, and forests. She showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.”[9] (Location 2830)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Her work created a new understanding of the actual delineation between common resources and private property. She and her colleagues clarified and codified how organically organized groups optimized the management of common resources for long term sustainability in opposition to the previously held theory that all common pool resources would be exploited, depleted, and most likely destroyed. (Location 2843)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From the work of Elinor Ostrom, and others, the advocates of Open Data and Open Software extended her research, findings and insights from forestry, irrigation, and policing systems to the new worlds of data and software. (Location 2849)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knowledge is open if anyone is free to access, use, modify, and share it— subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness.”[14] (Location 2860)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open Data evolved in conjunction and in parallel with the concept of Open-Source Software (Location 2874)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The OKF is a not-for-profit organization that works to communicate, train and bring about the use of open data on a global basis. The mission of the OKF is, “to create a more open world– a world where all non-personal information is open, free for everyone to use, build on and share; and creators and innovators are fairly recognized and rewarded.”[19] It is worthwhile to note that the OKF’s mission exempts personal information from their definition of open. (Location 2893)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open Data is an economic imperative that can drive a level of value generation such that it can be a driving force in lifting sections of populations and younger generations out of poverty. Open Data needs to be ubiquitous across all governments and all relevant data, and it will be in the coming years. (Location 2948)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Data exchanges are emerging as a key component of the data economy. By connecting data suppliers and consumers through a seamless experience, data exchanges have created a modern-day gold rush to help modern, digital organizations address their insatiable hunger for data. And, by eliminating the friction from finding, acquiring, and integrating data, these exchanges make it easy for any company to monetize its data assets and create new revenue streams.”[27] (Location 2971)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Shanghai Data Exchange was established to address the major difficulties in data trading including identification of data ownership, pricing of data, reaching mutual trust between transaction parties, initiating transactions and overall supervision, said local authorities.[30] (Location 2982)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>“Data intermediation services would include&amp;hellip; data pools established jointly by several legal or natural persons with the intention to license the use of such a pool to all interested parties in a manner that all participants contributing to the pool would receive a reward for their contribution to the pool.”[32] (Location 3008)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One company that is working toward creating data unions that can be managed in a unified and consistent manner is Pooldata.io.[34] (Location 3027)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data lineage is the same as your genealogical lineage. When new data is created from existing data; or generated from raw, aggregated, or other natural source of data, the new data has a lineage— a connection to the source or original data. (Location 3258)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tracking data lineage is not hard to do. It simply requires keeping records of how data was created and where that data has been used. The new data world will create a new market for existing and expanded data lineage products and services. (Location 3269)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I expect that the royalty payments for our part in derived data will be less than naturally occurring data, but we will be paid, nonetheless. (Location 3310)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Synthetic data is created from our view of the world. We do not use existing data in the creation of synthetic data, we simply generate the data that we believe we need. (Location 3313)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Much of the synthetic data created today is created by using algorithms. Originally, we would create the data by hand from copying and extending data that we knew was close to or approximates the raw data. (Location 3324)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When I am executing consulting work, I ask for the rights to the simulation data, and most people are happy to sign those rights over to my consulting firm. If I am employed at a full-time job and I oversee this type of work, I ensure that all the (Location 3348)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>most data that is created soon will be created without any human intervention. The data will be created in machine-to-machine interfaces and the data will be created, stored, managed, used, and analyzed without any humans being in the loop. (Location 3377)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Earlier I remarked that I did not view the early stages of the analytics continuum as true analytics, I still hold this to be true, but I wanted to include these early stages for clarity as to where the analytics continuum begins. (Location 3399)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prescriptive models prescribe the actions that business executives, managers and subject matter experts should take. (Location 3431)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Based on the data used in the prediction/prescription efforts, data science teams build simulation systems that enable business users to vary their assumptions and plans. The simulation system is run many times to see which of their plans, ideas and visions produce the best business outcomes. (Location 3437)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>simulation environments enable business managers to gain confidence that they are seeing the projected performance of markets, companies, products, and customers in a safe environment. Business managers can try sets of plans and variables that they have seen before in real world markets. They can validate the models are producing accurate results and empower business users to create new and interesting scenarios delivering a competitive advantage. (Location 3444)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Digital Twins[5] are an area of simulation that is widely used and has provided significant benefits to organizations around the world. (Location 3450)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Optimization models and applications build on all the preceding levels of data and analytics sophistication that we have discussed. (Location 3453)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Optimization models and applications analyze the billions and trillions of simulations and recommend the best course of action that is aligned with the business outcomes and objectives stated as the best outcome by the business executives, managers and subject matter experts. (Location 3459)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data scientists are innovators, creators of change, drivers of transformation. We do not want statisticians to be data scientists, and the reverse is true as well. There are roles for both and we need and want both, but let’s not confuse the two. (Location 3486)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not hire a data scientist to execute purely statistical work and do not hire a statistician to be a data scientist. (Location 3487)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As with most changes in the world, data won’t change in a big bang. Not all factors will change in an instant. The world at large; laws, regulations, enforcement, business operations, attitudes and compliance does not change in the blink of an eye. (Location 3561)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>· The current trend in consumer sentiment against being tracked, targeted, and messaged to with irrelevant offers, messages, and divisive content will continue to be of concern to a significant portion of the population. (Location 3634)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DIs will have access to data from millions of people, the DIs will constantly analyze the data, to glean insights on sources of demand, price points, access frequency, industries, and companies. If the laws around the world follow the EU model, DIs will be prohibited from selling data. (Location 3827)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since they can’t sell data, they will be committed to their goal of making your data accessible, usable, valuable, and easy to leverage by you and the companies that want to use our data in their commercial efforts. (Location 3830)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DIs will be able to tell you which groups and categories of data are in demand and the market price that is being paid for that data. (Location 3833)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Integrating your data into larger groups can be done within your data sets. Combining your purchase data category with your browsing data category, would be a common integration. Integrating your in-store grocery purchases with your online grocery purchases would provide a complete wallet share of your grocery spending. Integrating data can be done with data of other people who have similar and/or dissimilar habits, lifestyles or economic status and can be done in many ways using the following dimensions (Location 3849)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As we have been discussing, you will be managing your data through your relationship with a DI. You will have several objectives and goals that help you align the deployment and use of your data with your values. If you are concerned about global warming, you can make your data or any subset of your data available to firms that support improving the global climate on very advantageous terms, you might even be able to pay those firms for using your data.

&lt;li>Data is very different from the traditional commodities that we are accustomed to, it doesn’t wear out, it gets more valuable as you accumulate it, it can be integrated in unlimited ways, it is easily transported around the world with almost no cost, and it has unique scarcity/abundance properties. For all these reasons, the view we need to take on monetizing data is different than if we were thinking about gold, oil, cash, or diamonds. (Location 3903)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Data for All is written to be an accessible book that is easy to read for the general population. (Location 14)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>digital data is a ubiquitous element in our lives. (Location 51)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The best we can do is be armed with knowledge, understand the possible ramifications of our actions, the implications of the length of the life of the data we are creating each and every minute of every day, the potential for misuse and abuse of the information and data once it is beyond our grasp and control. (Location 91)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each of us is responsible for our data and for the lifecycle of our data. Whether we have ever thought about it or not, it is up to us to take control of our data and to actively make conscious choices (Location 101)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>today. The data ecosystem was never intended to become what it is today. That is because the data ecosystem has organically and rapidly evolved over the past 30 years in a globally distributed manner due to the independent actions of corporations, (Location 112)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>These millions of entities are acting on their own best, narrowly defined, interests. No one is driving the bus, and that needs to change. (Location 114)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the company HAD met the legal burden, but in the end, it is DNA data. DNA data, at least a complete genome, is the ultimate personal identifier, isn’t it? It is impossible to truly deidentify your complete genome. (Location 134)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>So when you sign up for a service and provide your swab with your DNA sample, the control of your resulting data is not with the DNA firm you signed up with.

&lt;li>The next evolution of the industry included the first generation of data brokers like InfoUSA and other firms that worked predominantly in the direct mail industry.

&lt;li>The precedence set in this instance is that as data ownership has almost no value it can be transferred from individuals to companies without the consent of the individuals that created the data.

&lt;li>Most people in the world do not have a stream or streams of passive income. “Passive income includes regular earnings from a source other than an employer or contractor. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says passive income can come from two sources: rental property or a business in which one does not actively participate, such as being paid book royalties or stock dividends,”[25] or a data dividend. Think about how nice that will be. Money for doing the things that you were going to do anyway and a stream of money that keeps coming each new week, month, or year. (Location 1217)&lt;/li>

Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters, and forests. She showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.”[9] (Location 2830)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Integrating your data into larger groups can be done within your data sets. Combining your purchase data category with your browsing data category, would be a common integration. Integrating your in-store grocery purchases with your online grocery purchases would provide a complete wallet share of your grocery spending. Integrating data can be done with data of other people who have similar and/or dissimilar habits, lifestyles or economic status and can be done in many ways using the following dimensions (Location 3849)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As we have been discussing, you will be managing your data through your relationship with a DI. You will have several objectives and goals that help you align the deployment and use of your data with your values. If you are concerned about global warming, you can make your data or any subset of your data available to firms that support improving the global climate on very advantageous terms, you might even be able to pay those firms for using your data.

&lt;li>Data is very different from the traditional commodities that we are accustomed to, it doesn’t wear out, it gets more valuable as you accumulate it, it can be integrated in unlimited ways, it is easily transported around the world with almost no cost, and it has unique scarcity/abundance properties. For all these reasons, the view we need to take on monetizing data is different than if we were thinking about gold, oil, cash, or diamonds. (Location 3903)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Doug Laney[12] has written the definitive book on understanding the underlying economics of data. The book is called, Infonomics[13]. (Location 3906)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your economic status will play a part in the value placed on your data in the open market. People who buy and spend more and in greater amounts will probably be paid more than those who buy and spend less in lesser amounts, but that is from a purely commercial perspective. (Location 3932)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your health status will play a part in valuing your data. People who have rare diseases or highly unusual blood types or disorders may be able to demand a premium price for their diagnostic, prescription history, medical records and genetic material and sequencing. (Location 3934)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“What if Facebook was an equitable business partner that shared half of its profit with those of us who actually provide the data that makes its business model run? Using my math (which is, again, open to debate), the average Facebook user would earn $10.77 per quarter. But, what if you are a more active user than average? Twice as active? Five times as active? Out of curiosity, I broke the numbers down below. · Half as active: $5.38 · Twice as active: $21.53 · Five times as active: $53.83 (Location 3942)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I believe, and I could be way off in my estimate of the annual data dividend, but in my view, there could be people who make over $20,000 to $50,000 or more each year from licensing their personal data. (Location 3954)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take note of the word licensing. You will not sell your data to companies; you will license it. You will retain ownership of the data and you will provide a limited use license to your data. (Location 3956)

&lt;li>First, don’t do business with companies that you know are hurting you, your families, your communities, your country, and the world. If you are involved with such a company, stop using their service, delete all your data, tell all your friends to stop using the platform. (Location 3991)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Second, sign up for every “do not mail” list that you can. It doesn’t take long, and it really works. Most of our discussions have been about online data and that is the most important category, but companies still mail a significant amount of material and the lists and data being held by those companies is significant, and those companies are the most aggressive resellers of your data. (Location 3993)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sign up for every “do not call” list that you can. The results are the same as above, but just on your mobile device. (Location 4001)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I wanted all of you to know that the world of data that we live in today did not come about by happenstance, it was designed and built on purpose. (Location 4012)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I am keen for everyone to know about the flawed data ownership model that has persisted since the beginning of the modern data industry. (Location 4022)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I felt and feel that it was and is important for you to know and understand how trust plays an important role in your relationship with your data and the organizations that want to use your data. As with all relationships, we need to have a baseline of trust. (Location 4031)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I feel that it is imperative for the people who will read this book to be aware of the massive, latent amount of economic value that will be created through the new world of data and that the economic value should be more evenly distributed, (Location 4037)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Document Note: This essay discusses the importance of code review in software engineering and the challenges of data science, where the norm is for data scientists to work alone. The author highlights the benefits of code review and collaboration, such as receiving feedback and learning more quickly, and explains the risks of data scientists working alone, such as the difficulty of collaborating and maintenance becoming a massive burden. The author also proposes solutions to make data science more collaborative, such as sharing Jupyter notebooks or setting up regular pair programming sessions.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>For as long as we&amp;rsquo;ve had analytics and BI teams, we&amp;rsquo;ve tried to create
&lt;a href="https://chartio.com/blog/3-steps-to-prioritizing-data-requests/" rel="noopener">good processes&lt;/a> for people to ask them questions. We’ve
&lt;a href="https://www.caitlinhudon.com/posts/2020/09/16/data-intake-form" rel="noopener">shared intake forms&lt;/a>. We’ve
&lt;a href="https://www.secoda.co/data-ticketing" rel="noopener">built products&lt;/a>. And yet, most data teams still can’t convince their business partners to regularly use them, and our most common ticket management system
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/imightbemary/status/1614663474113806338" rel="noopener">is still Slack DMs&lt;/a>. We’ve put self-serve interfaces between us and everyone else, and declared it

&lt;li>If we want to be in the
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrkwgEUXyTU" rel="noopener">room where it happens&lt;/a>, we shouldn’t spend our time trying to sell an unnecessary service to a reluctant buyer; we should spend it figuring out what we can do that would make it necessary for us to be there. (

&lt;li>The corollary to both of these points is that we have to talk to our customers. We have to research them; understand them; put ourselves in their shoes and figure out why they do what they do. When they push us aside, we shouldn’t assume that we’re offering something valuable—strategic advice! Metrics and alignment! Experimentation and the scientific method!—and our job is to sell it; we should instead ask them why they don’t want it.
The answers may surprise us. Our advice might be bad.
&lt;a href="https://commoncog.com/goodharts-law-not-useful/" rel="noopener">Metrics might not be that useful.&lt;/a> We might create more disruption and doubt than we do agreement and alignment. If there’s a case to be made for

&lt;h2 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Under Genghis Khan’s direction, the Mongols were as ruthless about stealing and absorbing the best of each culture they encountered as they were about conquest itself. (

&lt;li>Genghis Khan was not born a genius. Instead, as one biographer put it, his was “a persistent cycle of pragmatic learning, experimental adaptation, and constant revision driven by his uniquely disciplined and focused will.” (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs90wb9b9mzs98jr144sfhmc" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He was the greatest conqueror the world ever knew because he was more open to learning than any other conqueror has ever been. (

&lt;li>In his campaigns against the Jurched, Khan learned the importance of winning hearts and minds. By working with the scholars and royal family of the lands he conquered, Khan was able to hold on to and manage these territories in ways that most empires could not. (

&lt;li>The Mongol Empire was remarkable for its religious freedoms, and most of all, for its love of ideas and convergence of cultures. (

&lt;li>As we first succeed, we will find ourselves in new situations, facing new problems. The freshly promoted soldier must learn the art of politics. The salesman, how to manage. The founder, how to delegate. The writer, how to edit others. The comedian, how to act. (

&lt;li>as our island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of our ignorance.” In other words, each victory and advancement that made Khan smarter also bumped him against new situations he’d never encountered before. (

&lt;li>With accomplishment comes a growing pressure to pretend that we know more than we do. To pretend we already know everything. Scientia infla (knowledge puffs up). (

&lt;li>At every step and every juncture in life, there is the opportunity to learn—and even if the lesson is purely remedial, we must not let ego block us from hearing it again. (

&lt;li>An amateur is defensive. The professional finds learning (and even, occasionally, being shown up) to be enjoyable; they like being challenged and humbled, and engage in education as an ongoing and endless process. (

&lt;li>Peter Drucker says that it’s not enough simply to want to learn. As people progress, they must also understand how they learn and then set up processes to facilitate this continual education. (

&lt;li>Full Title: Engineers Shouldn’t Write ETL: A Guide to Building a High Functioning Data Science Department&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Category: #articles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Document Note: Frustration among groups.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>DS: Misalignment of motivations and slow into production&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DE: Lack of debt tech vision and costs of productionizing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Infrastructure: Lack of business context
What went wrong?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In most ocasions you don&amp;rsquo;t need specialized DE to build solutions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everybody wants to be the thinker. In traditional departments there were only doers.
You need engineers to do engineer stuff, not to serve other roles.
Stitchfix proposal:
&lt;em>A way that allows for autonomy in roles, true ownership all the way into production, and accountability for output.&lt;/em>
The trick is to create an environment that allows for autonomy, ownership, and focus for everyone involved.
engineers and data scientists are impassioned by very different tasks
&lt;strong>Nobody enjoys writing and maintaining data pipelines or ETL&lt;/strong>.
&lt;em>Engineers should not write ETL.&lt;/em> For the love of everything sacred and holy in the profession, this should not be a dedicated or specialized role. There is nothing more soul sucking than writing, maintaining, modifying, and supporting ETL to produce data that you yourself never get to use or consume.
Instead, give people end-to-end ownership of the work they produce (autonomy). In the case of data scientists, that means ownership of the ETL. It also means ownership of the analysis of the data and the outcome of the data science. The best-case outcome of many efforts of data scientists is an artifact meant for a machine consumer, not a human one. Autonomy means the data scientists own that code as well. &lt;em>All the way into production.&lt;/em> 
What is the role of an engineer in this new, horizontal world? To sum it up, engineers must deploy platforms, services, abstractions, and frameworks that allow the data scientists to conceive of, develop, and deploy their ideas with autonomy
We are not optimizing the organization for efficiency, we are optimizing for autonomy.
&lt;em>It is absolutely essential for platform engineers to stay ahead of the data science teams.&lt;/em> You need very sharp platform engineers who can make intuitive decisions about what services, frameworks, and capabilities need to be in place before they are desperately needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

The trick is to create an environment that allows for autonomy, ownership, and focus for everyone involved.
engineers and data scientists are impassioned by very different tasks
&lt;strong>Nobody enjoys writing and maintaining data pipelines or ETL&lt;/strong>.
&lt;em>Engineers should not write ETL.&lt;/em> For the love of everything sacred and holy in the profession, this should not be a dedicated or specialized role. There is nothing more soul sucking than writing, maintaining, modifying, and supporting ETL to produce data that you yourself never get to use or consume.
Instead, give people end-to-end ownership of the work they produce (autonomy). In the case of data scientists, that means ownership of the ETL. It also means ownership of the analysis of the data and the outcome of the data science. The best-case outcome of many efforts of data scientists is an artifact meant for a machine consumer, not a human one. Autonomy means the data scientists own that code as well. &lt;em>All the way into production.&lt;/em> 
What is the role of an engineer in this new, horizontal world? To sum it up, engineers must deploy platforms, services, abstractions, and frameworks that allow the data scientists to conceive of, develop, and deploy their ideas with autonomy
We are not optimizing the organization for efficiency, we are optimizing for autonomy.
&lt;em>It is absolutely essential for platform engineers to stay ahead of the data science teams.&lt;/em> You need very sharp platform engineers who can make intuitive decisions about what services, frameworks, and capabilities need to be in place before they are desperately needed.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>At the simplest level, search is the process of finding matches to a user-provided query string. While this base-level version of search is sometimes still utilized in simpler applications, for the most part, the results from queries that users perform are personalized to them, in order to surface documents that are more likely to be relevant to the user’s interests.

&lt;li>Search engines have typically relied on a reverse index-based information retrieval system, which maps individual words or terms in the documents or records, and helps drastically reduce the candidate sets by several orders of magnitude. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr7f85n2q72jjtpvkn0w62qs" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Elasticsearch stores data in an index and searches the inverted indices for query terms when a query is submitted. When a match for the query term is found, the corresponding document is returned. Breaking down the documents and identifying them by their key terms allows for faster retrieval of results. (

&lt;li>Semantic Retrieval
While there are many ways to perform semantic retrieval, TTSN with BERT is frequently used in combination with KNN indices when working with personalized search. (

&lt;li>At the simplest level, search is the process of finding matches to a user-provided query string. While this base-level version of search is sometimes still utilized in simpler applications, for the most part, the results from queries that users perform are personalized to them, in order to surface documents that are more likely to be relevant to the user’s interests.

&lt;li>Search engines have typically relied on a reverse index-based information retrieval system, which maps individual words or terms in the documents or records, and helps drastically reduce the candidate sets by several orders of magnitude. (

&lt;li>Elasticsearch stores data in an index and searches the inverted indices for query terms when a query is submitted. When a match for the query term is found, the corresponding document is returned. Breaking down the documents and identifying them by their key terms allows for faster retrieval of results. (

&lt;li>Everybody knows that focus time is important especially for individual contributor levels. But also in a management role I value focus time a lot for strategic work, research, analysis, and sometimes even just to be able to process all input and reflect on what the current state and bigger picture are.

&lt;li>To ensure sufficient focus time for everyone we mainly used two strategies in the tech department:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Have dedicated meeting slots in everyone&amp;rsquo;s calendars and use them for all/most meetings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Have senior/principal developers available to unblock people quickly (

&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And by this there are usually only two hours of meeting time per day, and they are always at the same time, so you can plan your day accordingly and you&amp;rsquo;ll know when you have to leave your focus zone (

&lt;li>Clearly define expected response times
• Mail: One working day
• Slack notification: 4 hours (during working hours) (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I began to suspect I had fallen into the same “simplicity” trap that many do when they use the word platform. This platform product manager role was not in fact managing one product, but instead the 4-5 separate products that comprised the platform. It was only once I dug into that level of detail that I felt I could fully describe the role. (

&lt;li>My point in writing this is to elevate the importance of discussing &lt;em>if&lt;/em> something should become a data product. It is really tempting to automate everything, to democratize a capability, so to speak. It is much harder to say “I don’t think that’s the right investment for us, let’s keep doing it more manually.” But for many companies and organizations, that might be the right answer. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkjqbzgqystsdg1pfpvda1" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let’s put aside the idea of persona, user needs, understanding the business problem and getting stakeholder buy-in. While those are hugely important for creating a useful data product, I’ve previously written about the pitfalls of not accounting for these components in a careful, methodical way. Instead, here are a few situations where the design of the product itself (more backend than frontend for now) is the bottleneck for growth and adoption of the product. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkmdk03sy2xehh7qh39s75" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In these newsletters, I typically try to include 5 points or things to think about. But today, I’ve just got one: look at the product you are responsible for. Look at the list of things you wish could be better about it. Then cut that list down to 1 thing. Yes, just one. It might not have anything to do with improving the data and everything to do with the product experience itself. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkrj1qqvb7nazgsy5x45kp" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why am I taking the time to say all of this? Because the key to being a data product manager is knowing when it isn’t all about the data. At some point, you may get no improvement from technical enhancements. In the coming 12-24 months, we’ll only get to do fewer things, not more. It won’t be all about the data, even if your job is to own a data product. (

&lt;li>&lt;em>Personas&lt;/em> are general representations of a user or customer. We build personas to represent different user types and characteristics of those users that use the product we build in a consistent or similar way. People are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> personas. An individual person is full of nuances and unique background, intentions and training. We need to actively create personas, we do not just “find them”. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkt8bcdj79sfjbakw6mawx" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This desire to help without thinking about personas is exactly where data products go off the rails. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdktv31fy6vr2hcvch6j3d2" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The builders of the data products are well intentioned. They are trying to do their best. They are listening to customers. It just happens to be the customers they are listening to are the loudest in the room and often those they are most familiar or comfortable with in the organization. We need to work actively against this tendency. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkv8s5j0rkpb812yda0mhe" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spend time defining the key personas in your organization that use or are impacted by data products. It is much easier to define these personas upfront that do it in an intense moment of planning or prioritization where time and patience are often much lower in availability. If you have these personas and socialize them in your company, you’ll be much better off when it comes to hard decisions. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkvdfm67ktvrn8hgvd27n2" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Push actively against the “Person X wants us to build Product Y” mentality. Many organizations I have been a part of justify product decisions with a name of someone who wants it, rather than the personas that they product actually serves. Specific people and decision makers are temporary at companies, but personas are long lasting. Ask about the persona. This is where having the personas laid out already pays off. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkw6zsve17exmjywwf48er" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It sounds simple to say focus on the persona. But power structures in an organization are a very real thing. It is hard for a data scientist or product manager to tell a VP that the product doesn’t clearly address a persona. This is where leadership matters a great deal. If you want to see change in this space, it cannot just be put on individual contributors. Leadership needs to sponsor these ideas and these processes. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkwnmtrst7s3vzbx5x7zd4" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If your company deprioritizes an area of investment, think about how your product investment should reflect that (or not). It is really common for a company to pivot investment in an “area” (which might be a key persona for your product) but the rest of the company does not quickly update to reflect that pivot. Specifically, you might have close relationships with key stakeholders who tell you “yeah, that isn’t important to the company, but I need it to do my job.” Be very wary of this type of situation. By focusing on people, it is easy to get confused about “what matters”. By focusing on where the company is headed and how different personas are part of that, it is easier to think less through the lens of working relationships and more through where the company needs to go.

&lt;li>My point in writing this is to elevate the importance of discussing &lt;em>if&lt;/em> something should become a data product. It is really tempting to automate everything, to democratize a capability, so to speak. It is much harder to say “I don’t think that’s the right investment for us, let’s keep doing it more manually.” But for many companies and organizations, that might be the right answer. (

&lt;li>Let’s put aside the idea of persona, user needs, understanding the business problem and getting stakeholder buy-in. While those are hugely important for creating a useful data product, I’ve previously written about the pitfalls of not accounting for these components in a careful, methodical way. Instead, here are a few situations where the design of the product itself (more backend than frontend for now) is the bottleneck for growth and adoption of the product. (

&lt;li>In these newsletters, I typically try to include 5 points or things to think about. But today, I’ve just got one: look at the product you are responsible for. Look at the list of things you wish could be better about it. Then cut that list down to 1 thing. Yes, just one. It might not have anything to do with improving the data and everything to do with the product experience itself. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkrj1qqvb7nazgsy5x45kp" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why am I taking the time to say all of this? Because the key to being a data product manager is knowing when it isn’t all about the data. At some point, you may get no improvement from technical enhancements. In the coming 12-24 months, we’ll only get to do fewer things, not more. It won’t be all about the data, even if your job is to own a data product. (

&lt;li>&lt;em>Personas&lt;/em> are general representations of a user or customer. We build personas to represent different user types and characteristics of those users that use the product we build in a consistent or similar way. People are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> personas. An individual person is full of nuances and unique background, intentions and training. We need to actively create personas, we do not just “find them”. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkt8bcdj79sfjbakw6mawx" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This desire to help without thinking about personas is exactly where data products go off the rails. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdktv31fy6vr2hcvch6j3d2" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The builders of the data products are well intentioned. They are trying to do their best. They are listening to customers. It just happens to be the customers they are listening to are the loudest in the room and often those they are most familiar or comfortable with in the organization. We need to work actively against this tendency. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkv8s5j0rkpb812yda0mhe" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spend time defining the key personas in your organization that use or are impacted by data products. It is much easier to define these personas upfront that do it in an intense moment of planning or prioritization where time and patience are often much lower in availability. If you have these personas and socialize them in your company, you’ll be much better off when it comes to hard decisions. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkvdfm67ktvrn8hgvd27n2" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Push actively against the “Person X wants us to build Product Y” mentality. Many organizations I have been a part of justify product decisions with a name of someone who wants it, rather than the personas that they product actually serves. Specific people and decision makers are temporary at companies, but personas are long lasting. Ask about the persona. This is where having the personas laid out already pays off. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkw6zsve17exmjywwf48er" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It sounds simple to say focus on the persona. But power structures in an organization are a very real thing. It is hard for a data scientist or product manager to tell a VP that the product doesn’t clearly address a persona. This is where leadership matters a great deal. If you want to see change in this space, it cannot just be put on individual contributors. Leadership needs to sponsor these ideas and these processes. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkwnmtrst7s3vzbx5x7zd4" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If your company deprioritizes an area of investment, think about how your product investment should reflect that (or not). It is really common for a company to pivot investment in an “area” (which might be a key persona for your product) but the rest of the company does not quickly update to reflect that pivot. Specifically, you might have close relationships with key stakeholders who tell you “yeah, that isn’t important to the company, but I need it to do my job.” Be very wary of this type of situation. By focusing on people, it is easy to get confused about “what matters”. By focusing on where the company is headed and how different personas are part of that, it is easier to think less through the lens of working relationships and more through where the company needs to go.

&lt;li>In an ideal career, you find yourself progressing up the difficultly curve, such that you are always doing some stuff you’re good at, and undertaking some new work (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs6bb3qs5wa0r022y08tfrzm" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you often find yourself experienced at tasks that the broader organization is unfamiliar with. This is a tricky time, because the organization depends on you to deliver the work that only you’re experienced with, while simultaneously depending on you to rapidly learn new skills that no one in the organization can teach you.

&lt;li>The consequences here are significant. The person in that role will often become a bottleneck on the company’s execution, and their rate of learning will decrease even more as they refocus on work they’ve already mastered (

&lt;li>it’s often the case that any manager’s failure to scale with the company can unintentionally cram down an entire organization’s career growth. (

&lt;li>our goal as a leader is to offload work that you are experienced at to the wider organization as rapidly as possible, freeing up room for you to continue learning. (

&lt;li>There is some nuance here. Often you’ll hear folks say that they want to be more strategic, and then they stop doing a bunch of critical work. That’s not the solution here. The goal is to solve for the work you’re experience with, not to abandon it. (

&lt;li>the majority of my learning occurs while working through the challenges of my daily work, and I think that’s an important goal to optimize for when trying to learn quickly enough to remain in-role at a growing company. (

&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re in a well-run organization, at some point, you&amp;rsquo;re going to run out of things that are both high-impact and easy. This leaves you with a choice between shifting right to hard and high-impact or shifting down to easy and low-impact. The latter choice&amp;ndash;easy and low-impact&amp;ndash;is what Walk refers to as &lt;em>snacking&lt;/em>. (

&lt;li>When you&amp;rsquo;re busy, these snacks give a sense of accomplishment that makes them psychologically rewarding. Still, you&amp;rsquo;re unlikely to learn much from doing them, others are likely equally capable of completing them (&lt;em>and&lt;/em> for some of them, it might be a good development opportunity), and there&amp;rsquo;s a tremendous opportunity cost versus doing something higher impact.

&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s ok to spend some of your time on snacks to keep yourself motivated between bigger accomplishments, but you have to keep yourself honest about how much time you&amp;rsquo;re spending on high-impact work versus low-impact work. In senior roles, you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to self-determine your work, and if you&amp;rsquo;re not deliberately tracking your work, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to catch yourself doing little to no high-impact work.

&lt;a href="https://lethain.com/grand-migration/" rel="noopener">a strategy shift that fundamentally misunderstands the challenges at hand&lt;/a>.

&lt;li>As a senior leader, you have to maintain a hold on your ego to avoid investing in meaningless work on a grand scale. (

&lt;li>Taking the time to understand the status quo before shifting it will always repay diligence with results. (

&lt;li>The first place to look for work that matters is exploring whether your company is experiencing an existential risk. Companies operate in an eternal

&lt;li>Existential issues are usually &lt;em>not&lt;/em> the most efficient place to add your efforts, but efficiency isn&amp;rsquo;t a priority when the walls are crashing down around you. You &lt;em>should&lt;/em> swarm to existential problems, but if a problem isn&amp;rsquo;t existential, then you should be skeptical of adding your efforts where everyone&amp;rsquo;s already focused.

&lt;li>Sometimes an area that an organization doesn&amp;rsquo;t pay attention to is so important that you&amp;rsquo;re going to want to advocate for it to start paying attention. Teaching a company to value something it doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about is the hardest sort of work you can do, and it often fails, so you should do as little of it as you can, but no less. (

&lt;li>One area that&amp;rsquo;s often underinvested in (i.e., lots of room to work in) while also being highly leveraged is growing the team around you (

&lt;li>A surprising number of projects are one small change away from succeeding, one quick modification away from unlocking a new opportunity, or one conversation away from consensus. I think of making those small changes, quick modifications, and short conversations as &lt;em>editing&lt;/em> your team&amp;rsquo;s approach (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gryqwkqb0zsk580dmgrth54q" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Whatever it is, things that simply won&amp;rsquo;t happen if you don&amp;rsquo;t do them are your biggest opportunity to work on something that matters, and it&amp;rsquo;s a category that will get both narrower and deeper the further you get into your career. (

&lt;li>You can&amp;rsquo;t escape subjective interview practices, but you can deliberately accumulate expertise from doing valuable work. Indeed, that&amp;rsquo;s the only viable long-term bet on your career: focus on work that matters, do projects that develop you, and steer towards companies that value genuine experience. (

Indeed, that&amp;rsquo;s the only viable long-term bet on your career: focus on work that matters, do projects that develop you, and steer towards companies that value genuine experience. (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re continuing to advance in your career, then even as your time available for work shrinks, the expectations around your impact will keep growing. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grynq5kd14wkx58w0wx7kdgy" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re in a well-run organization, at some point, you&amp;rsquo;re going to run out of things that are both high-impact and easy. This leaves you with a choice between shifting right to hard and high-impact or shifting down to easy and low-impact. The latter choice&amp;ndash;easy and low-impact&amp;ndash;is what Walk refers to as &lt;em>snacking&lt;/em>. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gryntktdj6bnf6wzyhw42acv" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you&amp;rsquo;re busy, these snacks give a sense of accomplishment that makes them psychologically rewarding. Still, you&amp;rsquo;re unlikely to learn much from doing them, others are likely equally capable of completing them (&lt;em>and&lt;/em> for some of them, it might be a good development opportunity), and there&amp;rsquo;s a tremendous opportunity cost versus doing something higher impact. (

&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s ok to spend some of your time on snacks to keep yourself motivated between bigger accomplishments, but you have to keep yourself honest about how much time you&amp;rsquo;re spending on high-impact work versus low-impact work. In senior roles, you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to self-determine your work, and if you&amp;rsquo;re not deliberately tracking your work, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to catch yourself doing little to no high-impact work.

&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly common for a new senior leader to join a company and immediately drive
&lt;a href="https://lethain.com/grand-migration/" rel="noopener">a strategy shift that fundamentally misunderstands the challenges at hand&lt;/a>. The ghosts of their previous situation hold such a firm grasp on their understanding of the new company that they misjudge the familiar as the essential. (

&lt;li>As a senior leader, you have to maintain a hold on your ego to avoid investing in meaningless work on a grand scale. (

&lt;li>Taking the time to understand the status quo before shifting it will always repay diligence with results. (

&lt;li>The first place to look for work that matters is exploring whether your company is experiencing an existential risk. Companies operate in an eternal
&lt;a href="https://lethain.com/iterative-elimination-tournaments/" rel="noopener">iterative elimination tournament&lt;/a>, balancing future success against surviving until that future becomes the present. (

&lt;li>If something dire is happening at your company, then that&amp;rsquo;s the place to be engaged (

&lt;li>Existential issues are usually &lt;em>not&lt;/em> the most efficient place to add your efforts, but efficiency isn&amp;rsquo;t a priority when the walls are crashing down around you. You &lt;em>should&lt;/em> swarm to existential problems, but if a problem isn&amp;rsquo;t existential, then you should be skeptical of adding your efforts where everyone&amp;rsquo;s already focused.

&lt;li>Sometimes an area that an organization doesn&amp;rsquo;t pay attention to is so important that you&amp;rsquo;re going to want to advocate for it to start paying attention. Teaching a company to value something it doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about is the hardest sort of work you can do, and it often fails, so you should do as little of it as you can, but no less. (

&lt;li>One area that&amp;rsquo;s often underinvested in (i.e., lots of room to work in) while also being highly leveraged is growing the team around you (

&lt;li>A surprising number of projects are one small change away from succeeding, one quick modification away from unlocking a new opportunity, or one conversation away from consensus. I think of making those small changes, quick modifications, and short conversations as &lt;em>editing&lt;/em> your team&amp;rsquo;s approach (

&lt;li>The final category of work that matters is the sort that you&amp;rsquo;re uniquely capable of accomplishing. (

&lt;li>Whatever it is, things that simply won&amp;rsquo;t happen if you don&amp;rsquo;t do them are your biggest opportunity to work on something that matters, and it&amp;rsquo;s a category that will get both narrower and deeper the further you get into your career. (

The role of the CEO is to lead by example incorporating data in the decision making process.
Data literacy programs should include concepts and best practices in data analysis in communication but also skills on finding and manipulating data within company.
Forming cross-functional teams (data analytics, business, product, tech) brings diveristy to problem solving.
It is also important to assess and monitor the data/analytics savviness of the leadership team.&lt;/li>

&lt;a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/form/the-state-of-dark-data.html" rel="noopener">survey&lt;/a> sponsored by the data analytics vendor Splunk of 1,300 senior executives found that while 81% of the executives agree that data skills are required to become a senior leader in their companies, 67% say they are not comfortable accessing or using data themselves. Seventy three percent felt that data skills are harder to learn than other business skills, and 53% believe they are too old to learn data skills. Effective education initiatives can prove them wrong. (

&lt;li>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Leading by example&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> is also important. This requires showcasing leaders who visibly use analytics and AI in internal marketing programs to spread the value of the approach across an organization. Leaders’ exemplary behavior can also include modeling the desired attitude about data and analytics in meetings; leaders should frequently ask, “Do you have data to support that point?” and encourage others to do likewise.

If those who make effective use of data and analytics get faster promotions and salary increases, others will notice. Of course, this approach requires leadership endorsement and sign-off and execution by Human Resources. (

Challenging because requires high level in skills that haven&amp;rsquo;t usually been taught together: data analysis + effective data communication
Not everyone needs to become a data scientist, it is important to assess the level of skills needed by each role.
Why you need data literacy:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Data literates make better decisions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Decisions have to be taken faster than ever
Data literacy roadmap:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Define data literacy goals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Assess current skills levels&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Design learning paths
Principles:
Focus on data, not on technology
Agree on the level of proficiency fo different job types
Avoid jargon
Define success metrics
In order to become data driven: we also need data maturity, data-driven leadership and data-drive decision making&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Epicteto, el filósofo griego, lo puso de otra forma: «No nos afecta lo que nos sucede, sino lo que nos decimos acerca de lo que nos sucede». (

&lt;li>Las creencias irracionales son todos aquellos pensamientos que generan malestar y debilidad emocional. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=326" rel="noopener">Location 326&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Podríamos definir las creencias irracionales como:   ideas autopresionantes superexigencias (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=330" rel="noopener">Location 330&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>creencias racionales que son:   renuncias que simplifican la vida ideas que nos sacan presión (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=333" rel="noopener">Location 333&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Albert Ellis, el padre de la psicología cognitiva, estableció una clasificación de todas las creencias irracionales que pueden existir —y puede haber infinitas—. Le salieron 3 grupos:   ¡Debo! hacer las cosas siempre bien. La gente me ¡debe! tratar bien. El mundo ¡debe! funcionar de forma correcta.   Fijémonos que las creencias irracionales son siempre «deberías», exigencias absolutistas cargadas de presión y con la absurda lógica de la obligación. Y podemos perpetrarlas en relación con nosotros mismos, a los demás y al mundo. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=338" rel="noopener">Location 338&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Las creencias racionales, las que nos permiten disfrutar de la vida, se parecen a las siguientes aseveraciones:   Para ser feliz, no es necesario hacerlo TODO bien, sino con amor. No necesito que TODO el mundo me trate bien TODO el tiempo. El mundo nunca ha funcionado perfectamente y, pese a eso, mucha gente ha conseguido disfrutar de la vida. Yo también puedo hacerlo.   Las creencias racionales son mucho más lógicas, sosegadas y maduras; producen ilusión por mejorar las cosas, pero sin obsesionarse con determinado resultado, y son la elección de las personas más fuertes y sanas. Todos podemos aprender a manejarlas. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=347" rel="noopener">Location 347&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Un famoso psicólogo cognitivo llamado Anthony de Mello empleaba la palabra «bastantidad» para definir el estilo de pensamiento de las personas emocionalmente fuertes. La «bastantidad» consiste en darse cuenta de que los seres humanos necesitamos muy poco para estar bien. La «bastantidad» es decirnos «ya tengo bastante» en cada momento de nuestra vida. En todos. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=357" rel="noopener">Location 357&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>la «bastantidad», virtud que se basa en el presupuesto de que todos los seres humanos necesitamos muy poco para estar bien. En concreto, sólo necesitamos la comida y el agua del día, y quizá un poco de cobijo para los días fríos, pero poco más. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=394" rel="noopener">Location 394&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Siempre que hablo de «bastantidad», la gente suele darme la razón en cuanto a los bienes materiales. Me dicen: «Es cierto, Rafael, tenemos demasiadas cosas. Esta sociedad de consumo es una exageración». Pero frecuentemente no caemos en que la «bastantidad» también hace referencia a los bienes inmateriales. En Occidente somos insaciables también en referencia a las virtudes, los amigos, la salud, el amor sentimental, la cultura, la extroversión, la necesidad de respeto, la libertad, la pasión vital, el entretenimiento&amp;hellip; (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=412" rel="noopener">Location 412&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Creer que se necesita «aprovechar la vida» o «tener hijos», por ejemplo, es tan absurdo como creer que se necesita un Ferrari, pero parece que la pasión vital es un objetivo más digno que un deportivo y por ello, tiene mayor credibilidad. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=417" rel="noopener">Location 417&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Una de las características de las personas sanas y fuertes es que le echan pasión a lo que tienen entre manos. Pero lo hacen lúdicamente. Sin miedo. Disfrutan de su trabajo y de sus aficiones, del cuidado de su salud y de sus hijos, pero no se preocupan por ello. Viven la vida como un juego. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=477" rel="noopener">Location 477&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Por lo visto, aquélla era la época de los monzones y, en consecuencia, algunas regiones de Tailandia se encontraban bajo el riesgo de huracanes. No había riesgo ni en Phi Phi ni en Phunket (razones por las cuales proliferaba el turismo en estas islas), pero sí en lugares como Ao Nang. [&amp;hellip;] (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=494" rel="noopener">Location 494&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El resultado fue que llegué a Tonsái, esperando encontrar una isla como cualquier otra&amp;hellip; y lo que encontré me pareció lo más cercano al paraíso. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=498" rel="noopener">Location 498&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Todas las personas sanas, incluidos los niños, sienten el impulso de emprender tareas. Pero lo lógico es que todos estos proyectos sean vividos como un juego. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=537" rel="noopener">Location 537&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Podemos trabajar, esforzarnos en múltiples aprendizajes y empresas, pero teniendo siempre claro que se trata de divertimentos: ¡nada que realmente vaya a suponer el fin del mundo o su inicio! (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=539" rel="noopener">Location 539&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cuando nos volvemos locos, olvidamos que la felicidad reside en nuestra mente y empezamos a buscar compulsivamente fuentes de gratificación externa. Entrar en ese juego es perjudicial porque, entonces, seguro que adquirimos la mente del mono loco. El mono loco es un primate que va de rama en rama, frenético, buscando la rama perfecta (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=585" rel="noopener">Location 585&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dónde está la felicidad?» se la podía dar cualquier mono sano: «La felicidad está en cualquier rama, ¿no lo ves?». (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=592" rel="noopener">Location 592&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El gran psicológo —ya deceso— Albert Ellis decía a sus pacientes que debían reevaluar sus creencias acerca de lo que es bueno, malo o terrible. Les (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=652" rel="noopener">Location 652&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los defensores del pensamiento positivo, como los americanos Louise L. Hay o Norman Vincent Peale, defienden que si uno se repite constantemente frases del estilo: «La vida me va cada día mejor en todos los aspectos», acabarás por creértelo, pero la mayoría de los psicólogos serios saben que esto no es así. El pensamiento positivo no es realista y por eso, tarde o temprano, la realidad acaba imponiéndose dando al traste con ese optimismo exagerado. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=667" rel="noopener">Location 667&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ésa es una de las claves más importantes de la felicidad: aceptar que los sucesos pueden ser malos, incluso muy malos, pero nunca terribles, nunca completamente desastrosos. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=674" rel="noopener">Location 674&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>LA RUTINA DEL DEBATE   Éste es el ejercicio central de la terapia cognitiva y consiste en transformar las creencias irracionales en racionales. Se trata de emplear una argumentación masiva para convencerse de que no hay nada que temer, que no hay nada «terrible» bajo el sol y, mucho menos, esas pequeñas adversidades que nos asustan, entristecen o enfurecen. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=724" rel="noopener">Location 724&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La rutina del debate consiste en transformar las creencias irracionales en racionales: todos los días. • Primero revisamos los malestares del día y les asignamos la creencia que los ha provocado. • En segundo lugar desenmascaramos esa lógica con argumentos contrarios. • Finalmente, redactamos una creencia racional que nos hará sentir mejor. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=820" rel="noopener">Location 820&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>al visualizar con intensidad nos provocamos una reacción emocional que nos ayuda a convencernos, a solidificar las nuevas creencias racionales que deseamos instaurar en nuestra mente. Siguiendo el símil de la carretera, al «sentir» las emociones racionales —hasta reír o llorar de alegría si uno quiere— parece como que los carriles, las hendiduras del camino, se hicieran más profundos y marcados. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=880" rel="noopener">Location 880&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Y, al cabo de unos segundos, volvemos a visualizarnos así, una y otra vez, disfrutando del domingo en soledad. La repetición juega a nuestro favor. Es interesante que intentemos alcanzar el máximo detalle posible. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=885" rel="noopener">Location 885&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>«la visualización de la vida plena». Su objetivo es comprender —a un nivel emocional— que podemos disfrutar de nuestra vida tal y como es, sin cambiar de trabajo, pareja o lugar de residencia. Se trata de la visualización antiqueja por excelencia porque es incompatible con la protesta y el victimismo. Las características de esta visualización son:   Está centrada en el presente, hoy, mañana y un futuro siempre cercano. Se concentra en que vamos a disfrutar más de todo. Y lo hacemos simplemente poniendo más pasión en lo que tenemos entre manos. Nos basamos en la evidencia de que en otros momentos lo hemos logrado. Nos apoyamos en la idea de que tenemos una gran capacidad de hacer interesante cada actividad de nuestra vida. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=896" rel="noopener">Location 896&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Otra visualización racional puede consistir en verse en una situación que nos atemoriza, pero estando tranquilos gracias a una nueva visión del asunto. A este ejercicio lo podríamos llamar «visualización en ausencia de miedo». Por ejemplo, verse en el dentista sosegados, en paz, gracias a la nueva cognición de que «nada terrible puede suceder en la consulta del odontólogo» o que «quizá puedo pasar un poco de dolor, pero eso es perfectamente soportable; incluso podría soportar mucho dolor durante un tiempo limitado», etc. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=903" rel="noopener">Location 903&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Con frecuencia desperdiciamos la vida corriendo de aquí para allá, postergando el goce para otro momento, cuando es ahora mismo cuando tenemos la oportunidad de disfrutar: en el trabajo, preparando la comida, haciendo deporte, conversando con un familiar. ¡Toma fotos de cada uno de tus instantes: son momentos preciosos en una vida muy corta! (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=991" rel="noopener">Location 991&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La visualización racional es un procedimiento comprobado que nos ayuda a potenciar el trabajo terapéutico. • La visualización racional se basa en el presupuesto fundamental de que «necesitamos muy poco para estar bien» y que, por lo tanto, «ya poseemos todo lo que necesitamos para tener una gran vida». • La visualización de la vida plena repasa todos los ámbitos de nuestra existencia en clave «antiqueja». Se trata de decirse: «A partir de ahora nos sentiremos bien apreciando lo que tenemos». (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1005" rel="noopener">Location 1005&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>los complejos, auténticos postes imaginarios para nuestra mente. Los complejos sólo existen en nuestra mente irracional. Las personas fuertes y racionales no ven ningún problema en el hecho de tener defectos. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1027" rel="noopener">Location 1027&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La clave para tener una mente excepcional, para vivir con pasión eléctrica desde el minuto uno hasta el último, es la inteligencia emocional, esto es, saber movilizar la gasolina que hace carburar las pasiones de nuestra vida: disfrutar de lo que hacemos, aprender, amar, jugar, hacer arte y, sobre todo, no perder el tiempo quejándose. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1104" rel="noopener">Location 1104&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ser inteligente a nivel emocional es tener claro —lo máximo posible— cuáles son las cualidades que realmente hacen que la vida sea emocionante y cuáles son cualidades falsas, o «cualidades trampa», como yo las llamo. Y no perder el tiempo con estas últimas. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1106" rel="noopener">Location 1106&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>la belleza física, la inteligencia, la elegancia, la habilidad verbal&amp;hellip; Son cualidades trampa porque alimentan el ego en un principio, pero luego te dejan vacío. Son cualidades que permiten acumular cosas que luego tendrás que amontonar en estúpidos trasteros. Que proporcionan la admiración de los locuelos y los inmaduros. Pero que no nos hacen felices. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1109" rel="noopener">Location 1109&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El arte, el amor, la amistad, la tolerancia a la frustración, la propia inteligencia emocional, la perseverancia&amp;hellip; estas cualidades atraen a los fuertes y sanos, a los que comparten, suman y hacen que nuestra vida mejore de verdad. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1114" rel="noopener">Location 1114&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Defender públicamente nuestros valores de amor y cooperación por encima de la competitividad y los valores trampa es algo que hacemos principalmente por nosotros mismos, pero también algo que podemos hacer por los demás. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1158" rel="noopener">Location 1158&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cada vez que yo muestro mis defectos con orgullo y afirmo que no necesito ser de otra forma para ser feliz, estoy defendiendo a las demás personas que tienen defectos. Es como decirse: «De acuerdo: no soy guapo, pero ¡no lo necesito!&amp;hellip; de la misma forma que un síndrome de Down no necesita ser listo para ser mi amigo». (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1160" rel="noopener">Location 1160&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Y es que la imagen no importa nada a la hora de tener una gran vida. Si quieres esforzarte por ser guapo, puedes hacerlo, pero va a ser un detalle nimio de tu vida. Ni necesitas la belleza para ser feliz, ni la hermosura te va a dar satisfacciones auténticas. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1188" rel="noopener">Location 1188&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>

Yo también puedo hacerlo.   Las creencias racionales son mucho más lógicas, sosegadas y maduras; producen ilusión por mejorar las cosas, pero sin obsesionarse con determinado resultado, y son la elección de las personas más fuertes y sanas. Todos podemos aprender a manejarlas. (

&lt;li>Un famoso psicólogo cognitivo llamado Anthony de Mello empleaba la palabra «bastantidad» para definir el estilo de pensamiento de las personas emocionalmente fuertes. La «bastantidad» consiste en darse cuenta de que los seres humanos necesitamos muy poco para estar bien. La «bastantidad» es decirnos «ya tengo bastante» en cada momento de nuestra vida. En todos. (

&lt;li>la «bastantidad», virtud que se basa en el presupuesto de que todos los seres humanos necesitamos muy poco para estar bien. En concreto, sólo necesitamos la comida y el agua del día, y quizá un poco de cobijo para los días fríos, pero poco más. (

&lt;li>Siempre que hablo de «bastantidad», la gente suele darme la razón en cuanto a los bienes materiales. Me dicen: «Es cierto, Rafael, tenemos demasiadas cosas. Esta sociedad de consumo es una exageración». Pero frecuentemente no caemos en que la «bastantidad» también hace referencia a los bienes inmateriales. En Occidente somos insaciables también en referencia a las virtudes, los amigos, la salud, el amor sentimental, la cultura, la extroversión, la necesidad de respeto, la libertad, la pasión vital, el entretenimiento&amp;hellip; (

&lt;li>Creer que se necesita «aprovechar la vida» o «tener hijos», por ejemplo, es tan absurdo como creer que se necesita un Ferrari, pero parece que la pasión vital es un objetivo más digno que un deportivo y por ello, tiene mayor credibilidad. (

&lt;li>Una de las características de las personas sanas y fuertes es que le echan pasión a lo que tienen entre manos. Pero lo hacen lúdicamente. Sin miedo. Disfrutan de su trabajo y de sus aficiones, del cuidado de su salud y de sus hijos, pero no se preocupan por ello. Viven la vida como un juego. (

&lt;li>Por lo visto, aquélla era la época de los monzones y, en consecuencia, algunas regiones de Tailandia se encontraban bajo el riesgo de huracanes.

&lt;li>Todas las personas sanas, incluidos los niños, sienten el impulso de emprender tareas. Pero lo lógico es que todos estos proyectos sean vividos como un juego. (

&lt;li>Podemos trabajar, esforzarnos en múltiples aprendizajes y empresas, pero teniendo siempre claro que se trata de divertimentos: ¡nada que realmente vaya a suponer el fin del mundo o su inicio! (

&lt;li>Cuando nos volvemos locos, olvidamos que la felicidad reside en nuestra mente y empezamos a buscar compulsivamente fuentes de gratificación externa. Entrar en ese juego es perjudicial porque, entonces, seguro que adquirimos la mente del mono loco. El mono loco es un primate que va de rama en rama, frenético, buscando la rama perfecta (

&lt;li>Dónde está la felicidad?» se la podía dar cualquier mono sano: «La felicidad está en cualquier rama, ¿no lo ves?». (

&lt;li>El gran psicológo —ya deceso— Albert Ellis decía a sus pacientes que debían reevaluar sus creencias acerca de lo que es bueno, malo o terrible. Les (

&lt;li>Los defensores del pensamiento positivo, como los americanos Louise L. Hay o Norman Vincent Peale, defienden que si uno se repite constantemente frases del estilo: «La vida me va cada día mejor en todos los aspectos», acabarás por creértelo, pero la mayoría de los psicólogos serios saben que esto no es así. El pensamiento positivo no es realista y por eso, tarde o temprano, la realidad acaba imponiéndose dando al traste con ese optimismo exagerado. (

&lt;li>Ésa es una de las claves más importantes de la felicidad: aceptar que los sucesos pueden ser malos, incluso muy malos, pero nunca terribles, nunca completamente desastrosos. (

&lt;li>LA RUTINA DEL DEBATE   Éste es el ejercicio central de la terapia cognitiva y consiste en transformar las creencias irracionales en racionales. Se trata de emplear una argumentación masiva para convencerse de que no hay nada que temer, que no hay nada «terrible» bajo el sol y, mucho menos, esas pequeñas adversidades que nos asustan, entristecen o enfurecen. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=724" rel="noopener">Location 724&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La rutina del debate consiste en transformar las creencias irracionales en racionales: todos los días. • Primero revisamos los malestares del día y les asignamos la creencia que los ha provocado. • En segundo lugar desenmascaramos esa lógica con argumentos contrarios. • Finalmente, redactamos una creencia racional que nos hará sentir mejor. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=820" rel="noopener">Location 820&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>al visualizar con intensidad nos provocamos una reacción emocional que nos ayuda a convencernos, a solidificar las nuevas creencias racionales que deseamos instaurar en nuestra mente. Siguiendo el símil de la carretera, al «sentir» las emociones racionales —hasta reír o llorar de alegría si uno quiere— parece como que los carriles, las hendiduras del camino, se hicieran más profundos y marcados. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=880" rel="noopener">Location 880&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Y, al cabo de unos segundos, volvemos a visualizarnos así, una y otra vez, disfrutando del domingo en soledad. La repetición juega a nuestro favor. Es interesante que intentemos alcanzar el máximo detalle posible. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=885" rel="noopener">Location 885&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>«la visualización de la vida plena». Su objetivo es comprender —a un nivel emocional— que podemos disfrutar de nuestra vida tal y como es, sin cambiar de trabajo, pareja o lugar de residencia. Se trata de la visualización antiqueja por excelencia porque es incompatible con la protesta y el victimismo. Las características de esta visualización son:   Está centrada en el presente, hoy, mañana y un futuro siempre cercano. Se concentra en que vamos a disfrutar más de todo. Y lo hacemos simplemente poniendo más pasión en lo que tenemos entre manos. Nos basamos en la evidencia de que en otros momentos lo hemos logrado. Nos apoyamos en la idea de que tenemos una gran capacidad de hacer interesante cada actividad de nuestra vida. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=896" rel="noopener">Location 896&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Otra visualización racional puede consistir en verse en una situación que nos atemoriza, pero estando tranquilos gracias a una nueva visión del asunto. A este ejercicio lo podríamos llamar «visualización en ausencia de miedo». Por ejemplo, verse en el dentista sosegados, en paz, gracias a la nueva cognición de que «nada terrible puede suceder en la consulta del odontólogo» o que «quizá puedo pasar un poco de dolor, pero eso es perfectamente soportable; incluso podría soportar mucho dolor durante un tiempo limitado», etc. (

&lt;li>Con frecuencia desperdiciamos la vida corriendo de aquí para allá, postergando el goce para otro momento, cuando es ahora mismo cuando tenemos la oportunidad de disfrutar: en el trabajo, preparando la comida, haciendo deporte, conversando con un familiar. ¡Toma fotos de cada uno de tus instantes: son momentos preciosos en una vida muy corta! (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=991" rel="noopener">Location 991&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La visualización racional es un procedimiento comprobado que nos ayuda a potenciar el trabajo terapéutico. • La visualización racional se basa en el presupuesto fundamental de que «necesitamos muy poco para estar bien» y que, por lo tanto, «ya poseemos todo lo que necesitamos para tener una gran vida». • La visualización de la vida plena repasa todos los ámbitos de nuestra existencia en clave «antiqueja». Se trata de decirse: «A partir de ahora nos sentiremos bien apreciando lo que tenemos». (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1005" rel="noopener">Location 1005&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>los complejos, auténticos postes imaginarios para nuestra mente. Los complejos sólo existen en nuestra mente irracional. Las personas fuertes y racionales no ven ningún problema en el hecho de tener defectos. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1027" rel="noopener">Location 1027&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La clave para tener una mente excepcional, para vivir con pasión eléctrica desde el minuto uno hasta el último, es la inteligencia emocional, esto es, saber movilizar la gasolina que hace carburar las pasiones de nuestra vida: disfrutar de lo que hacemos, aprender, amar, jugar, hacer arte y, sobre todo, no perder el tiempo quejándose. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1104" rel="noopener">Location 1104&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ser inteligente a nivel emocional es tener claro —lo máximo posible— cuáles son las cualidades que realmente hacen que la vida sea emocionante y cuáles son cualidades falsas, o «cualidades trampa», como yo las llamo. Y no perder el tiempo con estas últimas. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1106" rel="noopener">Location 1106&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>la belleza física, la inteligencia, la elegancia, la habilidad verbal&amp;hellip; Son cualidades trampa porque alimentan el ego en un principio, pero luego te dejan vacío. Son cualidades que permiten acumular cosas que luego tendrás que amontonar en estúpidos trasteros. Que proporcionan la admiración de los locuelos y los inmaduros. Pero que no nos hacen felices. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1109" rel="noopener">Location 1109&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El arte, el amor, la amistad, la tolerancia a la frustración, la propia inteligencia emocional, la perseverancia&amp;hellip; estas cualidades atraen a los fuertes y sanos, a los que comparten, suman y hacen que nuestra vida mejore de verdad. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1114" rel="noopener">Location 1114&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Defender públicamente nuestros valores de amor y cooperación por encima de la competitividad y los valores trampa es algo que hacemos principalmente por nosotros mismos, pero también algo que podemos hacer por los demás. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1158" rel="noopener">Location 1158&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cada vez que yo muestro mis defectos con orgullo y afirmo que no necesito ser de otra forma para ser feliz, estoy defendiendo a las demás personas que tienen defectos. Es como decirse: «De acuerdo: no soy guapo, pero ¡no lo necesito!&amp;hellip; de la misma forma que un síndrome de Down no necesita ser listo para ser mi amigo». (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1160" rel="noopener">Location 1160&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Y es que la imagen no importa nada a la hora de tener una gran vida. Si quieres esforzarte por ser guapo, puedes hacerlo, pero va a ser un detalle nimio de tu vida. Ni necesitas la belleza para ser feliz, ni la hermosura te va a dar satisfacciones auténticas. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1188" rel="noopener">Location 1188&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Albert Ellis, el padre de la psicología cognitiva, estableció una clasificación de todas las creencias irracionales que pueden existir —y puede haber infinitas—. Le salieron 3 grupos:   ¡Debo! hacer las cosas siempre bien. La gente me ¡debe! tratar bien. El mundo ¡debe! funcionar de forma correcta.   Fijémonos que las creencias irracionales son siempre «deberías», exigencias absolutistas cargadas de presión y con la absurda lógica de la obligación. Y podemos perpetrarlas en relación con nosotros mismos, a los demás y al mundo. (

Se trata de la visualización antiqueja por excelencia porque es incompatible con la protesta y el victimismo. Las características de esta visualización son:   Está centrada en el presente, hoy, mañana y un futuro siempre cercano. Se concentra en que vamos a disfrutar más de todo. Y lo hacemos simplemente poniendo más pasión en lo que tenemos entre manos. Nos basamos en la evidencia de que en otros momentos lo hemos logrado. Nos apoyamos en la idea de que tenemos una gran capacidad de hacer interesante cada actividad de nuestra vida. (

&lt;li>Otra visualización racional puede consistir en verse en una situación que nos atemoriza, pero estando tranquilos gracias a una nueva visión del asunto. A este ejercicio lo podríamos llamar «visualización en ausencia de miedo». Por ejemplo, verse en el dentista sosegados, en paz, gracias a la nueva cognición de que «nada terrible puede suceder en la consulta del odontólogo» o que «quizá puedo pasar un poco de dolor, pero eso es perfectamente soportable; incluso podría soportar mucho dolor durante un tiempo limitado», etc. (

&lt;li>Con frecuencia desperdiciamos la vida corriendo de aquí para allá, postergando el goce para otro momento, cuando es ahora mismo cuando tenemos la oportunidad de disfrutar: en el trabajo, preparando la comida, haciendo deporte, conversando con un familiar. ¡Toma fotos de cada uno de tus instantes: son momentos preciosos en una vida muy corta!

&lt;li>La visualización racional es un procedimiento comprobado que nos ayuda a potenciar el trabajo terapéutico. • La visualización racional se basa en el presupuesto fundamental de que «necesitamos muy poco para estar bien» y que, por lo tanto, «ya poseemos todo lo que necesitamos para tener una gran vida». • La visualización de la vida plena repasa todos los ámbitos de nuestra existencia en clave «antiqueja». Se trata de decirse: «A partir de ahora nos sentiremos bien apreciando lo que tenemos». (

&lt;li>los complejos, auténticos postes imaginarios para nuestra mente. Los complejos sólo existen en nuestra mente irracional. Las personas fuertes y racionales no ven ningún problema en el hecho de tener defectos. (

&lt;li>La clave para tener una mente excepcional, para vivir con pasión eléctrica desde el minuto uno hasta el último, es la inteligencia emocional, esto es, saber movilizar la gasolina que hace carburar las pasiones de nuestra vida: disfrutar de lo que hacemos, aprender, amar, jugar, hacer arte y, sobre todo, no perder el tiempo quejándose. (

&lt;li>Ser inteligente a nivel emocional es tener claro —lo máximo posible— cuáles son las cualidades que realmente hacen que la vida sea emocionante y cuáles son cualidades falsas, o «cualidades trampa», como yo las llamo. Y no perder el tiempo con estas últimas. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1106" rel="noopener">Location 1106&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>la belleza física, la inteligencia, la elegancia, la habilidad verbal&amp;hellip; Son cualidades trampa porque alimentan el ego en un principio, pero luego te dejan vacío. Son cualidades que permiten acumular cosas que luego tendrás que amontonar en estúpidos trasteros. Que proporcionan la admiración de los locuelos y los inmaduros. Pero que no nos hacen felices. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1109" rel="noopener">Location 1109&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El arte, el amor, la amistad, la tolerancia a la frustración, la propia inteligencia emocional, la perseverancia&amp;hellip; estas cualidades atraen a los fuertes y sanos, a los que comparten, suman y hacen que nuestra vida mejore de verdad. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1114" rel="noopener">Location 1114&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Defender públicamente nuestros valores de amor y cooperación por encima de la competitividad y los valores trampa es algo que hacemos principalmente por nosotros mismos, pero también algo que podemos hacer por los demás. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1158" rel="noopener">Location 1158&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cada vez que yo muestro mis defectos con orgullo y afirmo que no necesito ser de otra forma para ser feliz, estoy defendiendo a las demás personas que tienen defectos. Es como decirse: «De acuerdo: no soy guapo, pero ¡no lo necesito!&amp;hellip; de la misma forma que un síndrome de Down no necesita ser listo para ser mi amigo». (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=1160" rel="noopener">Location 1160&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Y es que la imagen no importa nada a la hora de tener una gran vida. Si quieres esforzarte por ser guapo, puedes hacerlo, pero va a ser un detalle nimio de tu vida. Ni necesitas la belleza para ser feliz, ni la hermosura te va a dar satisfacciones auténticas. (

&lt;li>Epicteto, el filósofo griego, lo puso de otra forma: «No nos afecta lo que nos sucede, sino lo que nos decimos acerca de lo que nos sucede». (

&lt;li>Las creencias irracionales son todos aquellos pensamientos que generan malestar y debilidad emocional. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=326" rel="noopener">Location 326&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Podríamos definir las creencias irracionales como:   ideas autopresionantes superexigencias (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=330" rel="noopener">Location 330&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>creencias racionales que son:   renuncias que simplifican la vida ideas que nos sacan presión (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=333" rel="noopener">Location 333&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Albert Ellis, el padre de la psicología cognitiva, estableció una clasificación de todas las creencias irracionales que pueden existir —y puede haber infinitas—. Le salieron 3 grupos:   ¡Debo! hacer las cosas siempre bien. La gente me ¡debe! tratar bien. El mundo ¡debe! funcionar de forma correcta.   Fijémonos que las creencias irracionales son siempre «deberías», exigencias absolutistas cargadas de presión y con la absurda lógica de la obligación. Y podemos perpetrarlas en relación con nosotros mismos, a los demás y al mundo. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=338" rel="noopener">Location 338&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Las creencias racionales, las que nos permiten disfrutar de la vida, se parecen a las siguientes aseveraciones:   Para ser feliz, no es necesario hacerlo TODO bien, sino con amor. No necesito que TODO el mundo me trate bien TODO el tiempo. El mundo nunca ha funcionado perfectamente y, pese a eso, mucha gente ha conseguido disfrutar de la vida. Yo también puedo hacerlo.   Las creencias racionales son mucho más lógicas, sosegadas y maduras; producen ilusión por mejorar las cosas, pero sin obsesionarse con determinado resultado, y son la elección de las personas más fuertes y sanas. Todos podemos aprender a manejarlas. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=347" rel="noopener">Location 347&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Un famoso psicólogo cognitivo llamado Anthony de Mello empleaba la palabra «bastantidad» para definir el estilo de pensamiento de las personas emocionalmente fuertes. La «bastantidad» consiste en darse cuenta de que los seres humanos necesitamos muy poco para estar bien. La «bastantidad» es decirnos «ya tengo bastante» en cada momento de nuestra vida. En todos. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=357" rel="noopener">Location 357&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>la «bastantidad», virtud que se basa en el presupuesto de que todos los seres humanos necesitamos muy poco para estar bien. En concreto, sólo necesitamos la comida y el agua del día, y quizá un poco de cobijo para los días fríos, pero poco más. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=394" rel="noopener">Location 394&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Siempre que hablo de «bastantidad», la gente suele darme la razón en cuanto a los bienes materiales. Me dicen: «Es cierto, Rafael, tenemos demasiadas cosas. Esta sociedad de consumo es una exageración». Pero frecuentemente no caemos en que la «bastantidad» también hace referencia a los bienes inmateriales. En Occidente somos insaciables también en referencia a las virtudes, los amigos, la salud, el amor sentimental, la cultura, la extroversión, la necesidad de respeto, la libertad, la pasión vital, el entretenimiento&amp;hellip; (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=412" rel="noopener">Location 412&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Creer que se necesita «aprovechar la vida» o «tener hijos», por ejemplo, es tan absurdo como creer que se necesita un Ferrari, pero parece que la pasión vital es un objetivo más digno que un deportivo y por ello, tiene mayor credibilidad. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=417" rel="noopener">Location 417&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Una de las características de las personas sanas y fuertes es que le echan pasión a lo que tienen entre manos. Pero lo hacen lúdicamente. Sin miedo. Disfrutan de su trabajo y de sus aficiones, del cuidado de su salud y de sus hijos, pero no se preocupan por ello. Viven la vida como un juego. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=477" rel="noopener">Location 477&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Por lo visto, aquélla era la época de los monzones y, en consecuencia, algunas regiones de Tailandia se encontraban bajo el riesgo de huracanes. No había riesgo ni en Phi Phi ni en Phunket (razones por las cuales proliferaba el turismo en estas islas), pero sí en lugares como Ao Nang. [&amp;hellip;] (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=494" rel="noopener">Location 494&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El resultado fue que llegué a Tonsái, esperando encontrar una isla como cualquier otra&amp;hellip; y lo que encontré me pareció lo más cercano al paraíso. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=498" rel="noopener">Location 498&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Todas las personas sanas, incluidos los niños, sienten el impulso de emprender tareas. Pero lo lógico es que todos estos proyectos sean vividos como un juego. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=537" rel="noopener">Location 537&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Podemos trabajar, esforzarnos en múltiples aprendizajes y empresas, pero teniendo siempre claro que se trata de divertimentos: ¡nada que realmente vaya a suponer el fin del mundo o su inicio! (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=539" rel="noopener">Location 539&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cuando nos volvemos locos, olvidamos que la felicidad reside en nuestra mente y empezamos a buscar compulsivamente fuentes de gratificación externa. Entrar en ese juego es perjudicial porque, entonces, seguro que adquirimos la mente del mono loco. El mono loco es un primate que va de rama en rama, frenético, buscando la rama perfecta (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=585" rel="noopener">Location 585&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dónde está la felicidad?» se la podía dar cualquier mono sano: «La felicidad está en cualquier rama, ¿no lo ves?». (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=592" rel="noopener">Location 592&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El gran psicológo —ya deceso— Albert Ellis decía a sus pacientes que debían reevaluar sus creencias acerca de lo que es bueno, malo o terrible. Les (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=652" rel="noopener">Location 652&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los defensores del pensamiento positivo, como los americanos Louise L. Hay o Norman Vincent Peale, defienden que si uno se repite constantemente frases del estilo: «La vida me va cada día mejor en todos los aspectos», acabarás por creértelo, pero la mayoría de los psicólogos serios saben que esto no es así. El pensamiento positivo no es realista y por eso, tarde o temprano, la realidad acaba imponiéndose dando al traste con ese optimismo exagerado. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=667" rel="noopener">Location 667&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ésa es una de las claves más importantes de la felicidad: aceptar que los sucesos pueden ser malos, incluso muy malos, pero nunca terribles, nunca completamente desastrosos. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=674" rel="noopener">Location 674&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>LA RUTINA DEL DEBATE   Éste es el ejercicio central de la terapia cognitiva y consiste en transformar las creencias irracionales en racionales. Se trata de emplear una argumentación masiva para convencerse de que no hay nada que temer, que no hay nada «terrible» bajo el sol y, mucho menos, esas pequeñas adversidades que nos asustan, entristecen o enfurecen. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=724" rel="noopener">Location 724&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La rutina del debate consiste en transformar las creencias irracionales en racionales: todos los días. • Primero revisamos los malestares del día y les asignamos la creencia que los ha provocado. • En segundo lugar desenmascaramos esa lógica con argumentos contrarios. • Finalmente, redactamos una creencia racional que nos hará sentir mejor. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=820" rel="noopener">Location 820&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>al visualizar con intensidad nos provocamos una reacción emocional que nos ayuda a convencernos, a solidificar las nuevas creencias racionales que deseamos instaurar en nuestra mente. Siguiendo el símil de la carretera, al «sentir» las emociones racionales —hasta reír o llorar de alegría si uno quiere— parece como que los carriles, las hendiduras del camino, se hicieran más profundos y marcados. (

&lt;li>Y, al cabo de unos segundos, volvemos a visualizarnos así, una y otra vez, disfrutando del domingo en soledad. La repetición juega a nuestro favor. Es interesante que intentemos alcanzar el máximo detalle posible. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00IPPKBWY&amp;amp;location=885" rel="noopener">Location 885&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Leonardo was following a practice that had become popular in Renaissance Italy of keeping a commonplace and sketch book, known as a zibaldone (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=1755" rel="noopener">Location 1755&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Francesco di Giorgio from Siena.8 Thirteen years older than Leonardo, he was another exemplar of an artisan who combined art, engineering, and architecture. He had begun as a painter, moved as a young man to Urbino to work as an architect, returned to Siena to run the underground aqueduct system, and was a sculptor in his spare time. He was also interested in military weaponry and fortifications. In other words, he was the Leonardo of Siena. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=2325" rel="noopener">Location 2325&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ideas are often generated in physical gathering places where people with diverse interests encounter one another serendipitously. That is why Steve Jobs liked his buildings to have a central atrium and why the young Benjamin Franklin founded a club where the most interesting people of Philadelphia would gather every Friday. At the court of Ludovico Sforza, Leonardo found friends who could spark new ideas by rubbing together their diverse passions. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=2517" rel="noopener">Location 2517&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Before you make a general rule of this case, test it two or three times and observe whether the tests produce the same effects.”7 (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=2718" rel="noopener">Location 2718&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The empirical method used by Bacon emphasized a cycle: observations should lead to a hypothesis, which should then be tested by precise experiments, which would then be used to refine the original hypothesis. Bacon also recorded and reported his experiments in precise detail so that others could independently replicate and verify them. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=2751" rel="noopener">Location 2751&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In his notebook, he described his method—almost like a trick—for closely observing a scene or object: look carefully and separately at each detail. He compared it to looking at the page of a book, which is meaningless when taken in as a whole and instead needs to be looked at word by word. Deep observation must be done in steps: “If you wish to have a sound knowledge of the forms of objects, begin with the details of them, and do not go on to the second step until you have the first well fixed in memory.”23 (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=2813" rel="noopener">Location 2813&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a paradox, which goes back to Zeno in the fifth century BC, involving the apparent contradiction of an object being in motion yet also being at a precise place at a given instant. Leonardo wrestled with the concept of depicting an arrested instant that contains both the past and the future of that moment. He compared an arrested instant of motion to the concept of a single geometrical point. The point has no length or width. Yet if it moves, it creates a line. “The point has no dimensions; the line is the transit of a point.” Using his method of theorizing by analogy, he wrote, “The instant does not have time; and time is made from the movement of the instant.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=2826" rel="noopener">Location 2826&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guided by this analogy, Leonardo in his art sought to freeze-frame an event while also showing it in motion. “In rivers, the water that you touch is the last of what has passed, and the first of that which comes,” he observed. “So with time present.” He came back to this theme repeatedly in his notebooks. “Observe the light,” he instructed. “Blink your eye and look at it again. That which you see was not there at first, and that which was there is no more.”27 (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=2832" rel="noopener">Location 2832&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Known as a paragone, from the Italian word for “comparison,” such a discourse was a way for artists and scholars to attract patrons and elevate their social status during the Italian Renaissance. This was another field in which Leonardo, with his love of both stagecraft and intellectual discussion, could excel as an ornament of the court. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=3968" rel="noopener">Location 3968&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I think not. Look longer at the picture. It vibrates with Leonardo’s understanding that no moment is discrete, self-contained, frozen, delineated, just as no boundary in nature is sharply delineated. As with the river that Leonardo described, each moment is part of what just passed and what is about to come. (

&lt;li>Each moment incorporates what came right before and what is coming right after. (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Leonardo was following a practice that had become popular in Renaissance Italy of keeping a commonplace and sketch book, known as a zibaldone (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=1755" rel="noopener">Location 1755&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Francesco di Giorgio from Siena.8 Thirteen years older than Leonardo, he was another exemplar of an artisan who combined art, engineering, and architecture. He had begun as a painter, moved as a young man to Urbino to work as an architect, returned to Siena to run the underground aqueduct system, and was a sculptor in his spare time. He was also interested in military weaponry and fortifications. In other words, he was the Leonardo of Siena. (

&lt;li>Ideas are often generated in physical gathering places where people with diverse interests encounter one another serendipitously. That is why Steve Jobs liked his buildings to have a central atrium and why the young Benjamin Franklin founded a club where the most interesting people of Philadelphia would gather every Friday. At the court of Ludovico Sforza, Leonardo found friends who could spark new ideas by rubbing together their diverse passions. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=2517" rel="noopener">Location 2517&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Before you make a general rule of this case, test it two or three times and observe whether the tests produce the same effects.”7 (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=2718" rel="noopener">Location 2718&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The empirical method used by Bacon emphasized a cycle: observations should lead to a hypothesis, which should then be tested by precise experiments, which would then be used to refine the original hypothesis. Bacon also recorded and reported his experiments in precise detail so that others could independently replicate and verify them. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=2751" rel="noopener">Location 2751&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In his notebook, he described his method—almost like a trick—for closely observing a scene or object: look carefully and separately at each detail. He compared it to looking at the page of a book, which is meaningless when taken in as a whole and instead needs to be looked at word by word. Deep observation must be done in steps: “If you wish to have a sound knowledge of the forms of objects, begin with the details of them, and do not go on to the second step until you have the first well fixed in memory.”23 (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=2813" rel="noopener">Location 2813&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a paradox, which goes back to Zeno in the fifth century BC, involving the apparent contradiction of an object being in motion yet also being at a precise place at a given instant. Leonardo wrestled with the concept of depicting an arrested instant that contains both the past and the future of that moment. He compared an arrested instant of motion to the concept of a single geometrical point. The point has no length or width. Yet if it moves, it creates a line. “The point has no dimensions; the line is the transit of a point.” Using his method of theorizing by analogy, he wrote, “The instant does not have time; and time is made from the movement of the instant.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=2826" rel="noopener">Location 2826&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guided by this analogy, Leonardo in his art sought to freeze-frame an event while also showing it in motion. “In rivers, the water that you touch is the last of what has passed, and the first of that which comes,” he observed. “So with time present.” He came back to this theme repeatedly in his notebooks. “Observe the light,” he instructed. “Blink your eye and look at it again. That which you see was not there at first, and that which was there is no more.”27 (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=2832" rel="noopener">Location 2832&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Known as a paragone, from the Italian word for “comparison,” such a discourse was a way for artists and scholars to attract patrons and elevate their social status during the Italian Renaissance. This was another field in which Leonardo, with his love of both stagecraft and intellectual discussion, could excel as an ornament of the court. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071Y385Q1&amp;amp;location=3968" rel="noopener">Location 3968&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I think not. Look longer at the picture. It vibrates with Leonardo’s understanding that no moment is discrete, self-contained, frozen, delineated, just as no boundary in nature is sharply delineated. As with the river that Leonardo described, each moment is part of what just passed and what is about to come. (

&lt;li>Each moment incorporates what came right before and what is coming right after. (

&lt;li>An iterative elimination tournament is a competition where you have to win your current round before advancing to play in the next round. If you don’t win, you don’t keep playing. If you have a great strategy for next round, but don’t do well in the current round, then you’ll never get a chance to take advantage of that strategy. If you have a great approach for today, but no plan for tomorrow, it’ll be a futre mired with regrets.
This model is so effective because it focuses you on (1) identifying what success looks like over various time frames, (2) selecting an evolution of approaches for your shifting needs. (

&lt;li>These dynamics can lead to teams whose camaraderie is at best a qualified non-aggression pact, and collaboration is infrequent. It’s a strange tragedy that we hold ourselves accountable for building healthy, functional teams, and are so rarely on them ourselves. (

&lt;li>Full Title: Managing People 🤯&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Category: #articles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Document Note: This article provides advice to managers of small teams and startups on how to effectively manage people. It covers topics such as taking ownership, decision making, fostering trust and transparency, providing feedback, and avoiding drive-by management. It also suggests to look for best practices that naturally emerge when hiring good people and to expect more from managers that report to you. It emphasizes that mistakes are not the team&amp;rsquo;s fault but the manager&amp;rsquo;s and encourages them to give their team members more authority and ways to shine.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>• your job is &lt;em>not to manage people&lt;/em>
• but to &lt;em>manage processes&lt;/em> and &lt;em>lead people&lt;/em> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtc6b3crtsp6h7spzk82z0a" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You manage processes on how you expect work to be done, where each person&amp;rsquo;s authority starts and ends, how their careers are made, and how all this can be discussed, and/or changed (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtc6qe5e5n3fvyd6ggvkxbf" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Act how you would want them to act if the role would be reversed. (

&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5195sk5153na7a5f8zkmvt" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Have few but very explicit processes and expect them to be followed (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtccsyz7bf9xxvjcechz4kd" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In every discussion/project/problem/situation, it needs to be clear who makes decisions
• …everyone else only adds opinions.
• Ideally, the person who will afterward do (or lead) the follow-up work makes the decisions. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtcdxm19dzcnzc4wwfakk0k" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Their manager has a &lt;em>handbrake&lt;/em> they can use to hard-stop decisions. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtcewnp29atkf19vgacev4p" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to get people to own a problem space fully
• But this is the goal (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtcjncqmdq0wfv65fjbq65j" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Feedback them, help them
• Trust them and let them make mistakes (within damage barriers)
• Consider mistakes &amp;ldquo;them leveling up&amp;rdquo; (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtch6r70893ccfw10d3x66n" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The worst thing that can happen is that you frequently step in, and people disassociate from their work
• They become drones who do what&amp;rsquo;s told instead of taking ownership.
• If this is your goal, you can hire cheaper, less talented people. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtchvhq117rb2fx7j4epy0w" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stay in the loop, set expectations, voice opinions, but let them handle it. Use your handbrake if needed. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtcn53ptx2p8ddnpxaqzvnt" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The easiest way to have people trust your work is by transparently sharing it without request.
• Have everything accessible where people would look for it (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtcpr2mk4tska625vtr0n6g" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Think of trust as something that you systemize
• Eg what kind of trust do you give a new team member?
• What are they expected to do in the first weeks? first month? (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtcqcnwe6spwmd6k0w9v30f" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>• Don&amp;rsquo;t start throwing your opinion or ideas around in meetings
• You most likely lack context, and most likely, you won&amp;rsquo;t be the person needing to follow through.
• Make it clear that it&amp;rsquo;s just opinions and not decisions.
• But know the power that the &amp;ldquo;opinion of the founder (or manager)&amp;rdquo; has towards most employees (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtcrzv1ggktrm7qmnf7ep6f" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I call it drive-by management because the manager comes by a group of people having a discussion. They throw requests, change mandates, and ideas around like bullets, create confusion, panic, chaos, and when they leave, they leave a bloody mess behind (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtcstw8xdghjhqky8typpr1" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>• people x context = output
• I had great people in bad setups that had lousy output
• I had very ordinary people in great setups that churned out more work than a whole team (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtctk7k9d9anqjc1qs3cs3e" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A junior engineer not keeping up with the work?
• Is it their fault? Or is your team right now not able to support a junior learning the game?
• This is ok, but should be either fixed or acknowledged (by discontinuing (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqte78j19smk0vcqekm5sdmw" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People should never be surprised that they are fired
• Context changed; new requirements should have been communicated (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqte7mf7qt2n1p8vqewq1hjr" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you discontinue someone, you do it usually because of context
• The company changed
• The expectations of the role changed
• You realized you looked for the wrong hiring criteria
• It&amp;rsquo;s most likely more your fault than theirs (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqte82xp0dc6g4nf8krws0nt" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>• Once you decide to fire someone, do it.
• Frequently people keep employees around in a zombie-like state (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqte98beb6p6bc19s6qwp59s" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>• Clear decisions after meetings
• No clear decision? Make that explicit too.
• Clear owners
• No clear owner? Make that explicit too.
• Hear everyone&amp;rsquo;s opinions
• Make explicit who makes the decision
• And what the decision is (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqteb80n5n0vtc91shmp8a2k" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When looking for best practices or changes in the team/processes, always look at first what already naturally emerged
• If you hire good people, they usually start looking for solutions naturally (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtebmdnd67bbq313pbawfb4" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>• You will always be unhappy with processes in your company
• You will have growing pains until you stagnate (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtec6fwa9bk5vhrv79rfbj3" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use the same principles you&amp;rsquo;d use in refactoring code
• Consider to
• Test in small isolation first
• Peer review
• Not to change everything at once
• Avoid over-engineering (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqteck6tcww1783kx837yf2j" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Burnout comes from a felt loss of control and/or impact. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqted9vdpbqefttkbxkgq8tb" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can you give people control over their impact?
• How can you define boundaries around chaos around them? (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqtedfp4na0qjw1jar23bqwy" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They are accountable for the outcomes
• Responsible for all failures
• But not responsible for the success
• Success is the team&amp;rsquo;s achievement (

&lt;li>Category: #articles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Document Note: This article provides advice to managers of small teams and startups on how to effectively manage people. It covers topics such as taking ownership, decision making, fostering trust and transparency, providing feedback, and avoiding drive-by management. It also suggests to look for best practices that naturally emerge when hiring good people and to expect more from managers that report to you. It emphasizes that mistakes are not the team&amp;rsquo;s fault but the manager&amp;rsquo;s and encourages them to give their team members more authority and ways to shine.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Document Note: When your team makes a mistake is often tempting to micromanage them and treat them as infants. The truth is that if you are surrounded by professionals is that they might need more context for doing a good job.
Management is more creative as it seems, how to structure your team, how to design effective processes, always having an eye on people development and delivery levels.
Management is a form of multiplying yourself and your very ultimate objective is to &lt;strong>make your team work well&lt;/strong>.
Management is hard and is more a craft than something you can learn.
Go to therapy to understand your inner tendencies and patterns. You have to deal with your fears and insecurities, you have the feeling of your technical skills degrade over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="management-definition">Management definition&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>For the author management is not a role, is a constellation of roles. The main difficulty, besides a calendar packed of meetings with different people and projects is to change hats from minute to minute:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>People manager&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Resource manager&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Project manager&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Communications manager&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Process manager&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Technical mentor and coach&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Unlike data science, where learning more was the answer to a skills gap, my time spent in books didn’t seem to translate directly into being better at my job.
As a manager, I found that it wasn’t knowledge I needed, it was the daily practice of doing the work. And in that, I was constantly bumping up against the limits of my bravery and patience (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If your team is like most teams I’ve been on, you have 2 - 3 problems for every available person. Thus, each member works on 1 or 2 problems simultaneously, with some folks taking 3 or more. And because everyone’s so busy, we barely have time to check in on each other’s projects outside of standup, planning, retrospective, etc. (

&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqszv6szhjqpw5cpc39e29y" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The pilot is the main project owner and is in charge of its success (or failure). They own and delegate the work as required though they’re usually responsible for the bulk of design and critical code paths. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqt0bsp8v2ka8bjgmrpa5me" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The copilot helps the pilot stay on track, identify critical flaws, and call out blindspots. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqt18np1z9vbfh1k8qfc79j" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For example, the copilot should challenge the pilot if the proposed design doesn’t solve the business problem, or if the train-validation split is invalid (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqt1njz8vqd8wtmvzamat7v" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For every 10 hours the pilot spends on the project, the copilot can expect to spend an hour on reviews (10% of the pilot’s effort). (

&lt;li>Pilots and copilots don’t have to be from the same job family. As an applied scientist, I often partner with an engineer who helps with infrastructure, observability, CI/CD, etc. If both scientist and engineer are sufficiently experienced, they can double up as each other’s copilot. As they review each other’s work, knowledge transfer occurs organically and they learn to be effective copilots for other engineers or scientists in future projects. (

&lt;li>we &lt;strong>timebox each project phase and task&lt;/strong> . Time constraints help us focus on the most important tasks and not get bogged down in the details. Timeboxing for machine learning projects can be challenging, because compared to engineering projects, the work is relatively ill-defined. Furthermore, a large part of the work is research and experimentation which unfortunately leads to many a dead end. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqtrfg1dx4anaqynhk27dya" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>less extreme approach is to set a timebox that is “comfortable yet challenging”. Thus, instead of halving the timebox, we reduce it by 10 - 20% (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqtsqtp19ca4gshzbwzj3p1" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>for greenfield projects that may be hard to scope, we can adopt standard timeboxes. For example, we might allocate two weeks for a literature review, four to eight weeks to build a prototype, and three to six months to implement it in production. (

&lt;li>If your team is like most teams I’ve been on, you have 2 - 3 problems for every available person. Thus, each member works on 1 or 2 problems simultaneously, with some folks taking 3 or more. And because everyone’s so busy, we barely have time to check in on each other’s projects outside of standup, planning, retrospective, etc. (

&lt;li>Pilots and copilots don’t have to be from the same job family. As an applied scientist, I often partner with an engineer who helps with infrastructure, observability, CI/CD, etc. If both scientist and engineer are sufficiently experienced, they can double up as each other’s copilot. As they review each other’s work, knowledge transfer occurs organically and they learn to be effective copilots for other engineers or scientists in future projects. (

&lt;li>You come to realise that thoughts come and go of their own accord; that you are not your thoughts. You can watch as they appear in your mind, seemingly from thin air, and watch again as they disappear, like a soap bubble bursting. You come to the profound understanding that thoughts and feelings (including negative ones) are transient. They come and they go, and ultimately, you have a choice about whether to act on them or not. (

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>when you start to feel a little sad, anxious, or irritable it’s not the mood that does the damage but how you react to it. • the effort of trying to free yourself from a bad mood or bout of unhappiness – of working out why you’re unhappy and what you can do about it – often makes things worse. It’s like being trapped in quicksand – the more you struggle to be free, the deeper you sink. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=242" rel="noopener">Location 242&lt;/a>)

&lt;li>Tags: [[favorite]]&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you begin to feel a little unhappy, it’s natural to try and think your way out of the problem of being unhappy. You try to establish what is making you unhappy and then find a solution. In the process, you can easily dredge up past regrets and conjure up future worries. This further lowers your mood. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=247" rel="noopener">Location 247&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The mind is constantly trawling through memories to find those that echo our current emotional state. For example, if you feel threatened, the mind instantly digs up memories of when you felt endangered in the past, so that you can spot similarities and find a way of escaping. It happens in an instant, before you’re even aware of it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=254" rel="noopener">Location 254&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The same is true with unhappiness, anxiety and stress. It is normal to feel a little unhappy from time to time, but sometimes a few sad thoughts can end up triggering a cascade of unhappy memories, negative emotions and harsh judgments. Before long, hours or even days can be coloured by negative self-critical thoughts such as, What’s wrong with me? My life is a mess. What will happen when they discover how useless I really am? Such self-attacking thoughts are incredibly powerful, and once they gather momentum they are almost impossible to stop. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=258" rel="noopener">Location 258&lt;/a>)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tags: [[favorite]]&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Similarly, our mood can act as an internal context that is every bit as powerful as a visit to an old holiday destination or the sound of a favourite tune. A flicker of sadness, frustration or anxiety can bring back unsettling memories, whether you want them or not. Soon you can be lost in gloomy thoughts and negative emotions. And often you don’t know where they came from – they just appeared, seemingly from thin air. You can become bad tempered, irritable or sad without really knowing why. You’re left wondering, Why am I in a bad mood? Or, Why do I feel so sad and tired today? (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=273" rel="noopener">Location 273&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The spirit in which you do something is often as important as the act itself. Think about the significance of this for a moment. If you do something in a negative or critical way, if you over-think or worry or carry out a task through gritted teeth, then you will activate your mind’s aversion system. This will narrow the focus of your life. You will become like a mouse with an owl complex: more anxious, less flexible, less creative. If, however, you do exactly the same thing in an open-hearted, welcoming manner, you thereby activate the mind’s ‘approach’ system: (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=1647" rel="noopener">Location 1647&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And nothing activates the mind’s avoidance system (and depresses the approach system) quite like the feeling of being trapped. This sense of being trapped is also central to extreme feelings of exhaustion and helplessness. Many people who work too hard, or for too long, end up being trapped by their own perfectionism and sense of responsibility – they feel, deep down, that there is ‘no escape’. It might be that, some time in the past, they had to prove something to themselves or to others because they felt bullied into it at home or at school, but over the years this has turned into a script that keeps them locked into old habits. This bullying script may once have helped them get what they wanted in life, but now it simply exhausts them. In this way, it’s all too easy to cede all the power to the ‘self-attacking’ aspect of yourself, and over time, you can come to feel, deep down, that the only possible response is to submit to the pressure. Trapped, your world seems to present fewer and fewer alternatives for action, whatever the reality. The result is long-term ‘demobilisation’. Your playfulness becomes paved over with concrete. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=1653" rel="noopener">Location 1653&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Although these negative spirals are incredibly powerful, you can begin to dissipate them just by becoming aware of them. The simple act of turning towards and observing them, helps to dissolve such patterns because they are maintained by the mind’s Doing mode (which has volunteered to help, even though it’s precisely the wrong tool for the job). The Doing mode entangles you even more in your own ideas of freedom, adding a sense of deep aversion and the demand that things should be different from how they are. So you become caught in a fantasy of freedom and miss the actuality of freedom available to you. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=1666" rel="noopener">Location 1666&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>John was on his way to school. He was worried about the maths lesson. He was not sure he could control the class again today. It was not part of a janitor’s duty.1 (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=1938" rel="noopener">Location 1938&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The way we interpret the world makes a huge difference to how we react. This is sometimes called the ABC model of emotions. The ‘A’ represents the situation itself – what a video camera would record. The ‘B’ is the interpretation given to the scene; the running story we create out of the situation, which often flows just beneath the surface of awareness but is taken as fact. The ‘C’ is our reactions: our emotions, body sensations and our impulses to act in various ways. Often, we see the ‘A’ and ‘C’ quite clearly, but we are not aware of the ‘B’. We think that the situation itself aroused our feelings and emotions when, in fact, it was our interpretation of the scene that did this. It’s as if the world were a silent film on which we write our own commentary. But the commentary, with its explanations of what is going on, happens so fast that we take it to be part of the film. It can become progressively more difficult to separate the ‘real’ facts of a situation from its interpretation. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=1954" rel="noopener">Location 1954&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take self-criticism as an example: when we are feeling stressed or vulnerable, we only hear the inner critic and not the quieter voice of compassion. If we do hear an alternative to the unsettling thoughts, we probably won’t believe the answers because the emotional punch behind the thoughts is so powerful that it overwhelms all of our logic. If we dismiss our thoughts as ‘nonsense’ or tell ourselves to ‘get a grip’ or to ‘pull yourself together’ then this further lowers our morale, leaving us wide open to further feelings of weakness and inadequacy. To make matters even worse, every time the tape of self-criticism begins to roll, we immediately start embellishing the story. We begin trawling our minds for supporting evidence and ignore everything to the contrary. Is it any wonder then, that the rumour mill in our minds can cause us so much unnecessary suffering? Is it so surprising that all of the ways in which we try and quench those rumours only end up making things far, far worse? Instead of confronting the mind’s rumour mill with logic and ‘positive thinking’, it makes far more sense to step outside the endless cycle and just watch the thoughts unfold in all their fevered beauty. But this can be difficult. If you look closely at the ‘rumours’ that start washing around the mind when you feel stressed, you’ll see how much a part of you they really appear to be. (

&lt;li>You come to realise that thoughts come and go of their own accord; that you are not your thoughts. You can watch as they appear in your mind, seemingly from thin air, and watch again as they disappear, like a soap bubble bursting. You come to the profound understanding that thoughts and feelings (including negative ones) are transient. They come and they go, and ultimately, you have a choice about whether to act on them or not. (

&lt;li>when you start to feel a little sad, anxious, or irritable it’s not the mood that does the damage but how you react to it. • the effort of trying to free yourself from a bad mood or bout of unhappiness – of working out why you’re unhappy and what you can do about it – often makes things worse. It’s like being trapped in quicksand – the more you struggle to be free, the deeper you sink. (

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you begin to feel a little unhappy, it’s natural to try and think your way out of the problem of being unhappy. You try to establish what is making you unhappy and then find a solution. In the process, you can easily dredge up past regrets and conjure up future worries. This further lowers your mood. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=247" rel="noopener">Location 247&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The mind is constantly trawling through memories to find those that echo our current emotional state. For example, if you feel threatened, the mind instantly digs up memories of when you felt endangered in the past, so that you can spot similarities and find a way of escaping. It happens in an instant, before you’re even aware of it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=254" rel="noopener">Location 254&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The same is true with unhappiness, anxiety and stress. It is normal to feel a little unhappy from time to time, but sometimes a few sad thoughts can end up triggering a cascade of unhappy memories, negative emotions and harsh judgments. Before long, hours or even days can be coloured by negative self-critical thoughts such as, What’s wrong with me? My life is a mess. What will happen when they discover how useless I really am? Such self-attacking thoughts are incredibly powerful, and once they gather momentum they are almost impossible to stop. (

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Similarly, our mood can act as an internal context that is every bit as powerful as a visit to an old holiday destination or the sound of a favourite tune. A flicker of sadness, frustration or anxiety can bring back unsettling memories, whether you want them or not. Soon you can be lost in gloomy thoughts and negative emotions. And often you don’t know where they came from – they just appeared, seemingly from thin air. You can become bad tempered, irritable or sad without really knowing why. You’re left wondering, Why am I in a bad mood? Or, Why do I feel so sad and tired today? (

&lt;li>The spirit in which you do something is often as important as the act itself. Think about the significance of this for a moment. If you do something in a negative or critical way, if you over-think or worry or carry out a task through gritted teeth, then you will activate your mind’s aversion system. This will narrow the focus of your life. You will become like a mouse with an owl complex: more anxious, less flexible, less creative. If, however, you do exactly the same thing in an open-hearted, welcoming manner, you thereby activate the mind’s ‘approach’ system: (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=1647" rel="noopener">Location 1647&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And nothing activates the mind’s avoidance system (and depresses the approach system) quite like the feeling of being trapped. This sense of being trapped is also central to extreme feelings of exhaustion and helplessness. Many people who work too hard, or for too long, end up being trapped by their own perfectionism and sense of responsibility – they feel, deep down, that there is ‘no escape’. It might be that, some time in the past, they had to prove something to themselves or to others because they felt bullied into it at home or at school, but over the years this has turned into a script that keeps them locked into old habits. This bullying script may once have helped them get what they wanted in life, but now it simply exhausts them. In this way, it’s all too easy to cede all the power to the ‘self-attacking’ aspect of yourself, and over time, you can come to feel, deep down, that the only possible response is to submit to the pressure. Trapped, your world seems to present fewer and fewer alternatives for action, whatever the reality. The result is long-term ‘demobilisation’. Your playfulness becomes paved over with concrete. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=1653" rel="noopener">Location 1653&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Although these negative spirals are incredibly powerful, you can begin to dissipate them just by becoming aware of them. The simple act of turning towards and observing them, helps to dissolve such patterns because they are maintained by the mind’s Doing mode (which has volunteered to help, even though it’s precisely the wrong tool for the job). The Doing mode entangles you even more in your own ideas of freedom, adding a sense of deep aversion and the demand that things should be different from how they are. So you become caught in a fantasy of freedom and miss the actuality of freedom available to you. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=1666" rel="noopener">Location 1666&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>John was on his way to school. He was worried about the maths lesson. He was not sure he could control the class again today. It was not part of a janitor’s duty.1 (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=1938" rel="noopener">Location 1938&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The way we interpret the world makes a huge difference to how we react. This is sometimes called the ABC model of emotions. The ‘A’ represents the situation itself – what a video camera would record. The ‘B’ is the interpretation given to the scene; the running story we create out of the situation, which often flows just beneath the surface of awareness but is taken as fact. The ‘C’ is our reactions: our emotions, body sensations and our impulses to act in various ways. Often, we see the ‘A’ and ‘C’ quite clearly, but we are not aware of the ‘B’. We think that the situation itself aroused our feelings and emotions when, in fact, it was our interpretation of the scene that did this. It’s as if the world were a silent film on which we write our own commentary. But the commentary, with its explanations of what is going on, happens so fast that we take it to be part of the film. It can become progressively more difficult to separate the ‘real’ facts of a situation from its interpretation. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=1954" rel="noopener">Location 1954&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take self-criticism as an example: when we are feeling stressed or vulnerable, we only hear the inner critic and not the quieter voice of compassion. If we do hear an alternative to the unsettling thoughts, we probably won’t believe the answers because the emotional punch behind the thoughts is so powerful that it overwhelms all of our logic. If we dismiss our thoughts as ‘nonsense’ or tell ourselves to ‘get a grip’ or to ‘pull yourself together’ then this further lowers our morale, leaving us wide open to further feelings of weakness and inadequacy. To make matters even worse, every time the tape of self-criticism begins to roll, we immediately start embellishing the story. We begin trawling our minds for supporting evidence and ignore everything to the contrary. Is it any wonder then, that the rumour mill in our minds can cause us so much unnecessary suffering?

&lt;li>Although these negative spirals are incredibly powerful, you can begin to dissipate them just by becoming aware of them. The simple act of turning towards and observing them, helps to dissolve such patterns because they are maintained by the mind’s Doing mode (which has volunteered to help, even though it’s precisely the wrong tool for the job). The Doing mode entangles you even more in your own ideas of freedom, adding a sense of deep aversion and the demand that things should be different from how they are. So you become caught in a fantasy of freedom and miss the actuality of freedom available to you. (

&lt;li>John was on his way to school. He was worried about the maths lesson. He was not sure he could control the class again today. It was not part of a janitor’s duty.1 (

&lt;li>The way we interpret the world makes a huge difference to how we react. This is sometimes called the ABC model of emotions. The ‘A’ represents the situation itself – what a video camera would record. The ‘B’ is the interpretation given to the scene; the running story we create out of the situation, which often flows just beneath the surface of awareness but is taken as fact. The ‘C’ is our reactions: our emotions, body sensations and our impulses to act in various ways. Often, we see the ‘A’ and ‘C’ quite clearly, but we are not aware of the ‘B’. We think that the situation itself aroused our feelings and emotions when, in fact, it was our interpretation of the scene that did this. It’s as if the world were a silent film on which we write our own commentary. But the commentary, with its explanations of what is going on, happens so fast that we take it to be part of the film. It can become progressively more difficult to separate the ‘real’ facts of a situation from its interpretation. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004TTHD9O&amp;amp;location=1954" rel="noopener">Location 1954&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take self-criticism as an example: when we are feeling stressed or vulnerable, we only hear the inner critic and not the quieter voice of compassion. If we do hear an alternative to the unsettling thoughts, we probably won’t believe the answers because the emotional punch behind the thoughts is so powerful that it overwhelms all of our logic. If we dismiss our thoughts as ‘nonsense’ or tell ourselves to ‘get a grip’ or to ‘pull yourself together’ then this further lowers our morale, leaving us wide open to further feelings of weakness and inadequacy. To make matters even worse, every time the tape of self-criticism begins to roll, we immediately start embellishing the story. We begin trawling our minds for supporting evidence and ignore everything to the contrary. Is it any wonder then, that the rumour mill in our minds can cause us so much unnecessary suffering? Is it so surprising that all of the ways in which we try and quench those rumours only end up making things far, far worse? Instead of confronting the mind’s rumour mill with logic and ‘positive thinking’, it makes far more sense to step outside the endless cycle and just watch the thoughts unfold in all their fevered beauty. But this can be difficult. If you look closely at the ‘rumours’ that start washing around the mind when you feel stressed, you’ll see how much a part of you they really appear to be. (

&lt;li>We are very good at preparing to live, but not very good at living. We know how to sacrifice ten years for a diploma, and we are willing to work very hard to get a job, a car, a house, and so on. But we have difficulty remembering that we are alive in the present moment, the only moment there is for us to be alive. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=187" rel="noopener">Location 187&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yet even a smile like that is enough to relax all the muscles in our face, to banish all worries and fatigue. A tiny bud of a smile on our lips nourishes awareness and calms us miraculously. It returns to us the peace we thought we had lost. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=206" rel="noopener">Location 206&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile. Dwelling in the present moment, I know this is a wonderful moment! (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=236" rel="noopener">Location 236&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>According to the method of conscious breathing, when we breathe in and out, we stop thinking, because saying “In” and “Out” is not thinking—“In” and “Out” are only words to help us concentrate on our breathing. If we keep breathing in and out this way for a few minutes, we become quite refreshed. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=257" rel="noopener">Location 257&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Watching a bad TV program, we become the TV program. We are what we feel and perceive. If we are angry, we are the anger. If we are in love, we are love. If we look at a snow-covered mountain peak, we are the mountain. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=275" rel="noopener">Location 275&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can use any sound to remind you to pause, breathe in and out, and enjoy the present moment. The buzzer that goes off when you forget to fasten the seat belt in your car is a bell of mindfulness. Even non-sounds, such as the rays of sunlight coming through the window, are bells of mindfulness that can remind us to return to ourselves, breathe, smile, and live fully in the present moment. (

&lt;li>When I was four years old, my mother used to bring me a cookie every time she came home from the market. I always went to the front yard and took my time eating it, sometimes half an hour or forty-five minutes for one cookie. I would take a small bite and look up at the sky. Then I would touch the dog with my feet and take another small bite. I just enjoyed being there, with the sky, the earth, the bamboo thickets, the cat, the dog, the flowers. I was able to do that because I did not have much to worry about. I did not think of the future, I did not regret the past. I was entirely in the present moment, with my cookie, the dog, the bamboo thickets, the cat, and everything. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=347" rel="noopener">Location 347&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eating mindfully is a most important practice of meditation. We can eat in a way that we restore the cookie of our childhood. The present moment is filled with joy and happiness. If you are attentive, you will see it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=354" rel="noopener">Location 354&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We each looked at our tangerine, and the children were invited to meditate on its origins. They saw not only their tangerine, but also its mother, the tangerine tree. With some guidance, they began to visualize the blossoms in the sunshine and in the rain. Then they saw petals falling down and the tiny green fruit appear. The sunshine and the rain continued, and the tiny tangerine grew. Now someone has picked it, and the tangerine is here. After seeing this, each child was invited to peel the tangerine slowly, noticing the mist and the fragrance of the tangerine, and then bring it up to his or her mouth and have a mindful bite, in full awareness of the texture and taste of the fruit and the juice coming out. We ate slowly like that. Each time you look at a tangerine, you can see deeply into it. You can see everything in the universe in one tangerine. When you peel it and smell it, it’s wonderful. You can take your time eating a tangerine and be very happy. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=360" rel="noopener">Location 360&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In our daily lives, we may see the people around us, but if we lack mindfulness, they are just phantoms, not real people, and we ourselves are also ghosts. Practicing mindfulness enables us to become a real person. When we are a real person, we see real people around us, and life is present in all its richness. The practice of eating bread, a tangerine, or a cookie is the same. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=371" rel="noopener">Location 371&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“The purpose of eating breakfast is to eat breakfast.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=379" rel="noopener">Location 379&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eating a meal in mindfulness is an important practice. We turn off the TV, put down our newspaper, and work together for five or ten minutes, setting the table and finishing whatever needs to be done. During these few minutes, we can be very happy. When the food is on the table and everyone is seated, we practice breathing: “Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile,” three times. We can recover ourselves completely after three breaths like this. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=380" rel="noopener">Location 380&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we look at each person as we breathe in and out in order to be in touch with ourselves and everyone at the table. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=383" rel="noopener">Location 383&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After breathing, we smile. Sitting at the table with other people, we have a chance to offer an authentic smile of friendship and understanding. It is very easy, but not many people do it. To me, this is the most important practice. We look at each person and smile at him or her. Breathing and smiling together is a very important practice. If the people in a household cannot smile at each other, the situation is very dangerous. (

&lt;li>After breathing and smiling, we look down at the food in a way that allows the food to become real. This food reveals our connection with the earth. Each bite contains the life of the sun and the earth. The extent to which our food reveals itself depends on us. We can see and taste the whole universe in a piece of bread! Contemplating our food for a few seconds before eating, and eating in mindfulness, can bring us much happiness. (

&lt;li>the idea that doing dishes is unpleasant can occur only when you aren’t doing them. Once you are standing in front of the sink with your sleeves rolled up and your hands in the warm water, it is really quite pleasant. I enjoy taking my time with each dish, being fully aware of the dish, the water, and each movement of my hands. I know that if I hurry in order to eat dessert sooner, the time of washing dishes will be unpleasant and not worth living. That would be a pity, for each minute, each second of life is a miracle. The dishes themselves and the fact that I am here washing them are miracles! (

&lt;li>Washing the dishes is at the same time a means and an end—that is, not only do we do the dishes in order to have clean dishes, we also do the dishes just to do the dishes, to live fully in each moment while washing them. (

&lt;li>We feel that there is a vacuum in us and we don’t want to confront it. We don’t like being so busy, but every time we have a spare moment, we are afraid of being alone with ourselves. We want to escape. Either we turn on the television, pick up the telephone, read a novel, go out with a friend, or take the car and go somewhere. Our civilization teaches us to act this way and provides us with many things we can use to lose touch with ourselves. (

&lt;li>When you practice half an hour of sitting meditation a day, that time should be for all twenty-four hours, and not just for that half-hour. One smile, one breath, should be for the benefit of the whole day, not just for that moment. We must practice in a way that removes the barrier between practice and non-practice. (

&lt;li>We should be able to bring the practice from the meditation hall into our daily lives. We need to discuss among ourselves how to do it. Do you practice breathing between phone calls? Do you practice smiling while cutting carrots? Do you practice relaxation after hours of hard work? These are practical questions. If you know how to apply meditation to dinner time, leisure time, sleeping time, it will penetrate your daily life, and it will also have a tremendous effect on social concerns. Mindfulness can penetrate the activities of everyday life, each minute, each hour of our daily life, and not just be a description of something far away. (

&lt;li>The foundation of happiness is mindfulness. The basic condition for being happy is our consciousness of being happy. If we are not aware that we are happy, we are not really happy. (

&lt;li>When we have a toothache, we know that not having a toothache is a wonderful thing. But when we do not have a toothache, we are still not happy. A non-toothache is very pleasant. There are so many things that are enjoyable, but when we don’t practice mindfulness, we don’t appreciate them. (

&lt;li>Western civilization places so much emphasis on the idea of hope that we sacrifice the present moment. Hope is for the future. It cannot help us discover joy, peace, or enlightenment in the present moment. Many religions are based on the notion of hope, and this teaching about refraining from hope may create a strong reaction. (

&lt;li>One day the Buddha held up a flower in front of an audience of 1,250 monks and nuns. He did not say anything for quite a long time. The audience was perfectly silent. Everyone seemed to be thinking hard, trying to see the meaning behind the Buddha’s gesture. Then, suddenly, the Buddha smiled. He smiled because someone in the audience smiled at him and at the flower. (

&lt;li>When we have an unpleasant feeling, we may want to chase it away. But it is more effective to return to our conscious breathing and just observe it, identifying it silently to ourselves: “Breathing in, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me. Breathing out, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me.” Calling a feeling by its name, such as “anger,” “sorrow,” “joy,” or “happiness,” helps us identify it clearly and recognize it more deeply.

&lt;li>Mindful observation is based on the principle of “non-duality”: our feeling is not separate from us or caused merely by something outside us; our feeling is us, and for the moment we are that feeling. (

&lt;li>A teacher has to give birth to the teacher within his student, and a psychotherapist has to give birth to the psychotherapist within his patient. The patient’s “internal psychotherapist” can then work full-time in a very effective way. (

&lt;li>After recognizing the feeling, becoming one with it, calming it down, and releasing it, we can look deeply into its causes, which are often based on inaccurate perceptions. As soon as we understand the causes and nature of our feelings, they begin to transform themselves. (

&lt;li>“Breathing in, I know that anger is in me. Breathing out, I know that I am my anger.” If we follow our breathing closely while we identify and mindfully observe our anger, it can no longer monopolize our consciousness. (

&lt;li>Like a fireman, we have to pour water on the blaze first and not waste time looking for the one who set the house on fire. “Breathing in, I know that I am angry. Breathing out, I know that I must put all my energy into caring for my anger.” So we avoid thinking about the other person, and we refrain from doing or saying anything as long as our anger persists.

&lt;li>When we are angry, our anger is our very self. To suppress or chase it away is to suppress or chase away our self. When we are joyful, we are the joy. When we are angry, we are the anger. When anger is born in us, we can be aware that anger is an energy in us, and we can accept that energy in order to transform it into another kind of energy. When we have a compost bin filled with organic material which is decomposing and smelly, we know that we can transform the waste into beautiful flowers. At first, we may see the compost and the flowers as opposite, but when we look deeply, we see that the flowers already exist in the compost, and the compost already exists in the flowers. (

&lt;li>Breathing in, I know that anger is here. Breathing out, I know that the anger is me. Breathing in, I know that anger is unpleasant. Breathing out, I know this feeling will pass. Breathing in, I am calm. Breathing out, I am strong enough to take care of this anger. (

&lt;li>If we look into our anger, we can see its roots, such as misunderstanding, clumsiness, injustice, resentment, or conditioning. (

&lt;li>If we do not untie our knots when they form, they will grow tighter and stronger. Our conscious, reasoning mind knows that negative feelings such as anger, fear, and regret are not wholly acceptable to ourselves or society, so it finds ways to repress them, to push them into remote areas of our consciousness in order to forget them. Because we want to avoid suffering, we create defense mechanisms that deny the existence of these negative feelings and give us the impression we have peace within ourselves. But our internal formations are always looking for ways to manifest as destructive images, feelings, thoughts, words, or behavior. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=812" rel="noopener">Location 812&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we live with another person, to protect each other’s happiness, we should help one another transform the internal formations that we produce together. (

&lt;li>Happiness is no longer an individual matter. If the other person is not happy, we will not be happy either. To transform the other person’s knots will help bring about our own happiness as well. A wife can create internal formations in her husband, and a husband can do so in his wife, and if they continue to create knots in each other, one day there will be no happiness left. Therefore, as soon as a knot is created, the wife, for example, should know that a knot has just been tied in her. She should not overlook it. (

&lt;li>In Buddhism, the word “suchness” is used to mean “the essence or particular characteristics of a thing or a person, its true nature.” Each person has his or her suchness. If we want to live in peace and happiness with a person, we have to see the suchness of that person. Once we see it, we understand him or her, and there will be no trouble. We can live peacefully and happily together. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=848" rel="noopener">Location 848&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we bring natural gas into our homes for heating and cooking, we know the suchness of gas. We know that gas is dangerous—it can kill us if we are not mindful. But we also know that we need the gas in order to cook, so we do not hesitate to bring it into our homes. The same is true of electricity. We could get electrocuted by it, but when we are mindful, it can help us, and there is no problem, because we know something about the suchness of electricity. A person is the same. If we do not know enough about the suchness of that person, we may get ourselves into trouble. But if we know, then we can enjoy each other very much and benefit a lot from one another. The key is knowing a person’s suchness. We do not expect a person always to be a flower. We have to understand his or her garbage as well. (

&lt;li>Before he left Vietnam forty years ago, his mother held his hand and told him, “Whenever you miss me, look into your hand, and you will see me immediately.” (

&lt;li>But I believe that the parents did not mean to plant those seeds. They did not intend to make their children suffer. Maybe they received the same kind of seeds from their parents. There is a continuation in the transmission of seeds, and their father and mother might have gotten those seeds from their grandfather and grandmother. Most of us are victims of a kind of living that is not mindful, and the practice of mindful living, of meditation, can stop these kinds of suffering and end the transmission of such sorrow to our children and grandchildren. We can break the cycle by not allowing these kinds of seeds of suffering to be transmitted to our children, our friends, or anyone else. (

&lt;li>When we look at our parents with compassion, often we see that our parents are only victims who never had the chance to practice mindfulness. They could not transform the suffering in themselves. But if we see them with compassionate eyes, we can offer them joy, peace, and forgiveness. In fact, when we look deeply, we discover that it is impossible to drop all identity with our parents. (

&lt;li>Every time a seed has an occasion to manifest itself, it produces new seeds of the same kind. If we are angry for five minutes, new seeds of anger are produced and deposited in the soil of our unconscious mind during those five minutes. That is why we have to be careful in selecting the kind of life we lead and the emotions we express. When I smile, the seeds of smiling and joy have come up. (

&lt;li>We often ask, “What’s wrong?” Doing so, we invite painful seeds of sorrow to come up and manifest. We feel suffering, anger, and depression, and produce more such seeds. We would be much happier if we tried to stay in touch with the healthy, joyful seeds inside of us and around us. We should learn to ask, “What’s not wrong?” and be in touch with that. (

&lt;li>Life is filled with many wonders, like the blue sky, the sunshine, the eyes of a baby. Our breathing, for example, can be very enjoyable. I enjoy breathing every day. But many people appreciate the joy of breathing only when they have asthma or a stuffed-up nose. We don’t need to wait until we have asthma to enjoy our breathing. (

&lt;li>Awareness of the precious elements of happiness is itself the practice of right mindfulness. Elements like these are within us and all around us. In each second of our lives we can enjoy them. If we do so, seeds of peace, joy, and happiness will be planted in us, and they will become strong. The secret to happiness is happiness itself. (

&lt;li>When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don’t blame the lettuce. You look into the reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or our family, we blame the other person. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=955" rel="noopener">Location 955&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and arguments. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=958" rel="noopener">Location 958&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you understand, you cannot help but love. You cannot get angry. To develop understanding, you have to practice looking at all living beings with the eyes of compassion. When you understand, you cannot help but love. And when you love, you naturally act in a way that can relieve the suffering of people. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=971" rel="noopener">Location 971&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we are in contact with another’s suffering, a feeling of compassion is born in us. Compassion means, literally, “to suffer with.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=992" rel="noopener">Location 992&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We can also meditate on the suffering of those who cause us to suffer. Anyone who has made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need to follow our breathing and look deeply, and naturally we will see his suffering. A part of his difficulties and sorrows may have been brought about by his parents’ lack of skill when he was still young. But his parents themselves may have been victims of their parents; the suffering has been transmitted from generation to generation and been reborn in him. If we see that, we will no longer blame him for making us suffer, because we know that he is also a victim. (

&lt;li>So when you hug your child, your friend, your spouse, I recommend that you first breathe in and out consciously and return to the present moment. Then, while you hold him or her in your arms, breathe three times consciously, and you will enjoy your hugging more than ever before. (

&lt;li>If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot be here either. (

&lt;li>Before each meal, we can join our palms in mindfulness and think about the children who do not have enough to eat. Doing so will help us maintain mindfulness of our good fortune, and perhaps one day we will find ways to do something to help change the system of injustice that exists in the world. (

&lt;li>Meditation is to look deeply into things and to see how we can change ourselves and how we can transform our situation. To transform our situation is also to transform our minds. To transform our minds is also to transform our situation, because the situation is mind, and mind is situation. (

&lt;li>During any conflict, we need people who can understand the suffering of all sides. For example, if a number of people in South Africa could go to each side and understand their suffering, and communicate that to the other sides, that would be very helpful. We need links. We need communication. Practicing nonviolence is first of all to become nonviolence. Then when a difficult situation presents itself, we will react in a way that will help the situation. This applies to problems of the family as well as to problems of society. (

&lt;li>“I am sorry, I hurt you out of my ignorance, out of my lack of mindfulness, out of my lack of skillfulness. I will try my best to change myself. I don’t dare to say anything more to you.” Sometimes, we do not have the intention to hurt, but because we are not mindful or skillful enough, we hurt someone. (

&lt;li>The second thing to do is to try to bring out the best part in ourselves, the part of the flower, to transform ourselves. That is the only way to demonstrate what you have just said. When you have become fresh and pleasant, the other person will notice very soon. Then when there is a chance to approach that person, you can come to her as a flower and she will notice immediately that you are quite different. You may not have to say anything. Just seeing you like that, she will accept you and forgive you. That is called “speaking with your life and not just with words.” (

&lt;li>We are very good at preparing to live, but not very good at living. We know how to sacrifice ten years for a diploma, and we are willing to work very hard to get a job, a car, a house, and so on. But we have difficulty remembering that we are alive in the present moment, the only moment there is for us to be alive. (

&lt;li>Yet even a smile like that is enough to relax all the muscles in our face, to banish all worries and fatigue. A tiny bud of a smile on our lips nourishes awareness and calms us miraculously. It returns to us the peace we thought we had lost. (

&lt;li>Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile. Dwelling in the present moment, I know this is a wonderful moment! (

&lt;li>According to the method of conscious breathing, when we breathe in and out, we stop thinking, because saying “In” and “Out” is not thinking—“In” and “Out” are only words to help us concentrate on our breathing. If we keep breathing in and out this way for a few minutes, we become quite refreshed. (

&lt;li>Watching a bad TV program, we become the TV program. We are what we feel and perceive. If we are angry, we are the anger. If we are in love, we are love. If we look at a snow-covered mountain peak, we are the mountain. (

&lt;li>You can use any sound to remind you to pause, breathe in and out, and enjoy the present moment. The buzzer that goes off when you forget to fasten the seat belt in your car is a bell of mindfulness. Even non-sounds, such as the rays of sunlight coming through the window, are bells of mindfulness that can remind us to return to ourselves, breathe, smile, and live fully in the present moment. (

&lt;li>When I was four years old, my mother used to bring me a cookie every time she came home from the market. I always went to the front yard and took my time eating it, sometimes half an hour or forty-five minutes for one cookie. I would take a small bite and look up at the sky. Then I would touch the dog with my feet and take another small bite. I just enjoyed being there, with the sky, the earth, the bamboo thickets, the cat, the dog, the flowers. I was able to do that because I did not have much to worry about. I did not think of the future, I did not regret the past. I was entirely in the present moment, with my cookie, the dog, the bamboo thickets, the cat, and everything. (

&lt;li>Eating mindfully is a most important practice of meditation. We can eat in a way that we restore the cookie of our childhood. The present moment is filled with joy and happiness. If you are attentive, you will see it. (

&lt;li>We each looked at our tangerine, and the children were invited to meditate on its origins. They saw not only their tangerine, but also its mother, the tangerine tree. With some guidance, they began to visualize the blossoms in the sunshine and in the rain. Then they saw petals falling down and the tiny green fruit appear. The sunshine and the rain continued, and the tiny tangerine grew. Now someone has picked it, and the tangerine is here. After seeing this, each child was invited to peel the tangerine slowly, noticing the mist and the fragrance of the tangerine, and then bring it up to his or her mouth and have a mindful bite, in full awareness of the texture and taste of the fruit and the juice coming out. We ate slowly like that. Each time you look at a tangerine, you can see deeply into it. You can see everything in the universe in one tangerine. When you peel it and smell it, it’s wonderful. You can take your time eating a tangerine and be very happy. (

&lt;li>In our daily lives, we may see the people around us, but if we lack mindfulness, they are just phantoms, not real people, and we ourselves are also ghosts. Practicing mindfulness enables us to become a real person. When we are a real person, we see real people around us, and life is present in all its richness. The practice of eating bread, a tangerine, or a cookie is the same. (

&lt;li>Eating a meal in mindfulness is an important practice. We turn off the TV, put down our newspaper, and work together for five or ten minutes, setting the table and finishing whatever needs to be done. During these few minutes, we can be very happy. When the food is on the table and everyone is seated, we practice breathing: “Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile,” three times. We can recover ourselves completely after three breaths like this. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=380" rel="noopener">Location 380&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we look at each person as we breathe in and out in order to be in touch with ourselves and everyone at the table. (

&lt;li>After breathing, we smile. Sitting at the table with other people, we have a chance to offer an authentic smile of friendship and understanding. It is very easy, but not many people do it. To me, this is the most important practice. We look at each person and smile at him or her. Breathing and smiling together is a very important practice. If the people in a household cannot smile at each other, the situation is very dangerous. (

&lt;li>After breathing and smiling, we look down at the food in a way that allows the food to become real. This food reveals our connection with the earth. Each bite contains the life of the sun and the earth. The extent to which our food reveals itself depends on us. We can see and taste the whole universe in a piece of bread! Contemplating our food for a few seconds before eating, and eating in mindfulness, can bring us much happiness. (

&lt;li>the idea that doing dishes is unpleasant can occur only when you aren’t doing them. Once you are standing in front of the sink with your sleeves rolled up and your hands in the warm water, it is really quite pleasant. I enjoy taking my time with each dish, being fully aware of the dish, the water, and each movement of my hands. I know that if I hurry in order to eat dessert sooner, the time of washing dishes will be unpleasant and not worth living. That would be a pity, for each minute, each second of life is a miracle. The dishes themselves and the fact that I am here washing them are miracles! (

&lt;li>Washing the dishes is at the same time a means and an end—that is, not only do we do the dishes in order to have clean dishes, we also do the dishes just to do the dishes, to live fully in each moment while washing them. (

&lt;li>We feel that there is a vacuum in us and we don’t want to confront it. We don’t like being so busy, but every time we have a spare moment, we are afraid of being alone with ourselves. We want to escape. Either we turn on the television, pick up the telephone, read a novel, go out with a friend, or take the car and go somewhere. Our civilization teaches us to act this way and provides us with many things we can use to lose touch with ourselves. (

&lt;li>When you practice half an hour of sitting meditation a day, that time should be for all twenty-four hours, and not just for that half-hour. One smile, one breath, should be for the benefit of the whole day, not just for that moment. We must practice in a way that removes the barrier between practice and non-practice. (

&lt;li>We should be able to bring the practice from the meditation hall into our daily lives. We need to discuss among ourselves how to do it. Do you practice breathing between phone calls? Do you practice smiling while cutting carrots? Do you practice relaxation after hours of hard work? These are practical questions. If you know how to apply meditation to dinner time, leisure time, sleeping time, it will penetrate your daily life, and it will also have a tremendous effect on social concerns. Mindfulness can penetrate the activities of everyday life, each minute, each hour of our daily life, and not just be a description of something far away. (

&lt;li>The foundation of happiness is mindfulness. The basic condition for being happy is our consciousness of being happy. If we are not aware that we are happy, we are not really happy. (

&lt;li>When we have a toothache, we know that not having a toothache is a wonderful thing. But when we do not have a toothache, we are still not happy. A non-toothache is very pleasant. There are so many things that are enjoyable, but when we don’t practice mindfulness, we don’t appreciate them. (

&lt;li>Western civilization places so much emphasis on the idea of hope that we sacrifice the present moment. Hope is for the future. It cannot help us discover joy, peace, or enlightenment in the present moment. Many religions are based on the notion of hope, and this teaching about refraining from hope may create a strong reaction. (

&lt;li>One day the Buddha held up a flower in front of an audience of 1,250 monks and nuns. He did not say anything for quite a long time. The audience was perfectly silent. Everyone seemed to be thinking hard, trying to see the meaning behind the Buddha’s gesture. Then, suddenly, the Buddha smiled. He smiled because someone in the audience smiled at him and at the flower. (

&lt;li>When we have an unpleasant feeling, we may want to chase it away. But it is more effective to return to our conscious breathing and just observe it, identifying it silently to ourselves: “Breathing in, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me. Breathing out, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me.” Calling a feeling by its name, such as “anger,” “sorrow,” “joy,” or “happiness,” helps us identify it clearly and recognize it more deeply.

&lt;li>Mindful observation is based on the principle of “non-duality”: our feeling is not separate from us or caused merely by something outside us; our feeling is us, and for the moment we are that feeling. (

&lt;li>A teacher has to give birth to the teacher within his student, and a psychotherapist has to give birth to the psychotherapist within his patient. The patient’s “internal psychotherapist” can then work full-time in a very effective way. (

&lt;li>After recognizing the feeling, becoming one with it, calming it down, and releasing it, we can look deeply into its causes, which are often based on inaccurate perceptions. As soon as we understand the causes and nature of our feelings, they begin to transform themselves. (

&lt;li>“Breathing in, I know that anger is in me. Breathing out, I know that I am my anger.” If we follow our breathing closely while we identify and mindfully observe our anger, it can no longer monopolize our consciousness. (

&lt;li>Like a fireman, we have to pour water on the blaze first and not waste time looking for the one who set the house on fire. “Breathing in, I know that I am angry. Breathing out, I know that I must put all my energy into caring for my anger.” So we avoid thinking about the other person, and we refrain from doing or saying anything as long as our anger persists.

&lt;li>When we are angry, our anger is our very self. To suppress or chase it away is to suppress or chase away our self. When we are joyful, we are the joy. When we are angry, we are the anger. When anger is born in us, we can be aware that anger is an energy in us, and we can accept that energy in order to transform it into another kind of energy. When we have a compost bin filled with organic material which is decomposing and smelly, we know that we can transform the waste into beautiful flowers. At first, we may see the compost and the flowers as opposite, but when we look deeply, we see that the flowers already exist in the compost, and the compost already exists in the flowers. (

&lt;li>Breathing in, I know that anger is here. Breathing out, I know that the anger is me. Breathing in, I know that anger is unpleasant. Breathing out, I know this feeling will pass. Breathing in, I am calm. Breathing out, I am strong enough to take care of this anger. (

&lt;li>If we look into our anger, we can see its roots, such as misunderstanding, clumsiness, injustice, resentment, or conditioning. (

&lt;li>If we do not untie our knots when they form, they will grow tighter and stronger. Our conscious, reasoning mind knows that negative feelings such as anger, fear, and regret are not wholly acceptable to ourselves or society, so it finds ways to repress them, to push them into remote areas of our consciousness in order to forget them. Because we want to avoid suffering, we create defense mechanisms that deny the existence of these negative feelings and give us the impression we have peace within ourselves. But our internal formations are always looking for ways to manifest as destructive images, feelings, thoughts, words, or behavior. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=812" rel="noopener">Location 812&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we live with another person, to protect each other’s happiness, we should help one another transform the internal formations that we produce together. (

&lt;li>Happiness is no longer an individual matter. If the other person is not happy, we will not be happy either. To transform the other person’s knots will help bring about our own happiness as well. A wife can create internal formations in her husband, and a husband can do so in his wife, and if they continue to create knots in each other, one day there will be no happiness left. Therefore, as soon as a knot is created, the wife, for example, should know that a knot has just been tied in her. She should not overlook it. (

&lt;li>In Buddhism, the word “suchness” is used to mean “the essence or particular characteristics of a thing or a person, its true nature.” Each person has his or her suchness. If we want to live in peace and happiness with a person, we have to see the suchness of that person. Once we see it, we understand him or her, and there will be no trouble. We can live peacefully and happily together. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=848" rel="noopener">Location 848&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we bring natural gas into our homes for heating and cooking, we know the suchness of gas. We know that gas is dangerous—it can kill us if we are not mindful. But we also know that we need the gas in order to cook, so we do not hesitate to bring it into our homes. The same is true of electricity. We could get electrocuted by it, but when we are mindful, it can help us, and there is no problem, because we know something about the suchness of electricity. A person is the same. If we do not know enough about the suchness of that person, we may get ourselves into trouble. But if we know, then we can enjoy each other very much and benefit a lot from one another. The key is knowing a person’s suchness. We do not expect a person always to be a flower. We have to understand his or her garbage as well. (

&lt;li>Before he left Vietnam forty years ago, his mother held his hand and told him, “Whenever you miss me, look into your hand, and you will see me immediately.” (

&lt;li>But I believe that the parents did not mean to plant those seeds. They did not intend to make their children suffer. Maybe they received the same kind of seeds from their parents. There is a continuation in the transmission of seeds, and their father and mother might have gotten those seeds from their grandfather and grandmother. Most of us are victims of a kind of living that is not mindful, and the practice of mindful living, of meditation, can stop these kinds of suffering and end the transmission of such sorrow to our children and grandchildren. We can break the cycle by not allowing these kinds of seeds of suffering to be transmitted to our children, our friends, or anyone else. (

&lt;li>When we look at our parents with compassion, often we see that our parents are only victims who never had the chance to practice mindfulness. They could not transform the suffering in themselves. But if we see them with compassionate eyes, we can offer them joy, peace, and forgiveness. In fact, when we look deeply, we discover that it is impossible to drop all identity with our parents. (

&lt;li>Every time a seed has an occasion to manifest itself, it produces new seeds of the same kind. If we are angry for five minutes, new seeds of anger are produced and deposited in the soil of our unconscious mind during those five minutes. That is why we have to be careful in selecting the kind of life we lead and the emotions we express. When I smile, the seeds of smiling and joy have come up. (

&lt;li>We often ask, “What’s wrong?” Doing so, we invite painful seeds of sorrow to come up and manifest. We feel suffering, anger, and depression, and produce more such seeds. We would be much happier if we tried to stay in touch with the healthy, joyful seeds inside of us and around us. We should learn to ask, “What’s not wrong?” and be in touch with that. (

&lt;li>Life is filled with many wonders, like the blue sky, the sunshine, the eyes of a baby. Our breathing, for example, can be very enjoyable. I enjoy breathing every day. But many people appreciate the joy of breathing only when they have asthma or a stuffed-up nose. We don’t need to wait until we have asthma to enjoy our breathing. (

&lt;li>Awareness of the precious elements of happiness is itself the practice of right mindfulness. Elements like these are within us and all around us. In each second of our lives we can enjoy them. If we do so, seeds of peace, joy, and happiness will be planted in us, and they will become strong. The secret to happiness is happiness itself. (

&lt;li>When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don’t blame the lettuce. You look into the reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or our family, we blame the other person. (

&lt;li>Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and arguments. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change. (

&lt;li>When you understand, you cannot help but love. You cannot get angry. To develop understanding, you have to practice looking at all living beings with the eyes of compassion. When you understand, you cannot help but love. And when you love, you naturally act in a way that can relieve the suffering of people. (

&lt;li>When we are in contact with another’s suffering, a feeling of compassion is born in us. Compassion means, literally, “to suffer with.” (

&lt;li>We can also meditate on the suffering of those who cause us to suffer. Anyone who has made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need to follow our breathing and look deeply, and naturally we will see his suffering. A part of his difficulties and sorrows may have been brought about by his parents’ lack of skill when he was still young. But his parents themselves may have been victims of their parents; the suffering has been transmitted from generation to generation and been reborn in him. If we see that, we will no longer blame him for making us suffer, because we know that he is also a victim. (

&lt;li>So when you hug your child, your friend, your spouse, I recommend that you first breathe in and out consciously and return to the present moment. Then, while you hold him or her in your arms, breathe three times consciously, and you will enjoy your hugging more than ever before. (

&lt;li>If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot be here either. (

&lt;li>Real strength is not in power, money, or weapons, but in deep, inner peace. (

&lt;li>When we sit down to dinner and look at our plate filled with fragrant and appetizing food, we can nourish our awareness of the bitter pain of people who suffer from hunger. (

&lt;li>Before each meal, we can join our palms in mindfulness and think about the children who do not have enough to eat. Doing so will help us maintain mindfulness of our good fortune, and perhaps one day we will find ways to do something to help change the system of injustice that exists in the world. (

&lt;li>If we cannot smile, we cannot help other people smile. If we are not peaceful, then we cannot contribute to the peace movement. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=1273" rel="noopener">Location 1273&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation is to look deeply into things and to see how we can change ourselves and how we can transform our situation. To transform our situation is also to transform our minds. To transform our minds is also to transform our situation, because the situation is mind, and mind is situation. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=1287" rel="noopener">Location 1287&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>During any conflict, we need people who can understand the suffering of all sides. For example, if a number of people in South Africa could go to each side and understand their suffering, and communicate that to the other sides, that would be very helpful. We need links. We need communication. Practicing nonviolence is first of all to become nonviolence. Then when a difficult situation presents itself, we will react in a way that will help the situation. This applies to problems of the family as well as to problems of society. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=1322" rel="noopener">Location 1322&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“I am sorry, I hurt you out of my ignorance, out of my lack of mindfulness, out of my lack of skillfulness. I will try my best to change myself. I don’t dare to say anything more to you.” Sometimes, we do not have the intention to hurt, but because we are not mindful or skillful enough, we hurt someone. (

&lt;li>The second thing to do is to try to bring out the best part in ourselves, the part of the flower, to transform ourselves. That is the only way to demonstrate what you have just said. When you have become fresh and pleasant, the other person will notice very soon. Then when there is a chance to approach that person, you can come to her as a flower and she will notice immediately that you are quite different. You may not have to say anything. Just seeing you like that, she will accept you and forgive you. That is called “speaking with your life and not just with words.” (

&lt;li>We are very good at preparing to live, but not very good at living. We know how to sacrifice ten years for a diploma, and we are willing to work very hard to get a job, a car, a house, and so on. But we have difficulty remembering that we are alive in the present moment, the only moment there is for us to be alive. (

&lt;li>Yet even a smile like that is enough to relax all the muscles in our face, to banish all worries and fatigue. A tiny bud of a smile on our lips nourishes awareness and calms us miraculously. It returns to us the peace we thought we had lost. (

&lt;li>Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile. Dwelling in the present moment, I know this is a wonderful moment! (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=236" rel="noopener">Location 236&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>According to the method of conscious breathing, when we breathe in and out, we stop thinking, because saying “In” and “Out” is not thinking—“In” and “Out” are only words to help us concentrate on our breathing. If we keep breathing in and out this way for a few minutes, we become quite refreshed. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=257" rel="noopener">Location 257&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Watching a bad TV program, we become the TV program. We are what we feel and perceive. If we are angry, we are the anger. If we are in love, we are love. If we look at a snow-covered mountain peak, we are the mountain. (

&lt;li>You can use any sound to remind you to pause, breathe in and out, and enjoy the present moment. The buzzer that goes off when you forget to fasten the seat belt in your car is a bell of mindfulness. Even non-sounds, such as the rays of sunlight coming through the window, are bells of mindfulness that can remind us to return to ourselves, breathe, smile, and live fully in the present moment. (

&lt;li>When I was four years old, my mother used to bring me a cookie every time she came home from the market. I always went to the front yard and took my time eating it, sometimes half an hour or forty-five minutes for one cookie. I would take a small bite and look up at the sky. Then I would touch the dog with my feet and take another small bite. I just enjoyed being there, with the sky, the earth, the bamboo thickets, the cat, the dog, the flowers. I was able to do that because I did not have much to worry about. I did not think of the future, I did not regret the past. I was entirely in the present moment, with my cookie, the dog, the bamboo thickets, the cat, and everything. (

&lt;li>Eating mindfully is a most important practice of meditation. We can eat in a way that we restore the cookie of our childhood. The present moment is filled with joy and happiness. If you are attentive, you will see it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=354" rel="noopener">Location 354&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We each looked at our tangerine, and the children were invited to meditate on its origins. They saw not only their tangerine, but also its mother, the tangerine tree. With some guidance, they began to visualize the blossoms in the sunshine and in the rain. Then they saw petals falling down and the tiny green fruit appear. The sunshine and the rain continued, and the tiny tangerine grew. Now someone has picked it, and the tangerine is here. After seeing this, each child was invited to peel the tangerine slowly, noticing the mist and the fragrance of the tangerine, and then bring it up to his or her mouth and have a mindful bite, in full awareness of the texture and taste of the fruit and the juice coming out. We ate slowly like that. Each time you look at a tangerine, you can see deeply into it. You can see everything in the universe in one tangerine. When you peel it and smell it, it’s wonderful. You can take your time eating a tangerine and be very happy. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=360" rel="noopener">Location 360&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In our daily lives, we may see the people around us, but if we lack mindfulness, they are just phantoms, not real people, and we ourselves are also ghosts. Practicing mindfulness enables us to become a real person. When we are a real person, we see real people around us, and life is present in all its richness. The practice of eating bread, a tangerine, or a cookie is the same. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=371" rel="noopener">Location 371&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“The purpose of eating breakfast is to eat breakfast.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=379" rel="noopener">Location 379&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eating a meal in mindfulness is an important practice. We turn off the TV, put down our newspaper, and work together for five or ten minutes, setting the table and finishing whatever needs to be done. During these few minutes, we can be very happy. When the food is on the table and everyone is seated, we practice breathing: “Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile,” three times. We can recover ourselves completely after three breaths like this. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=380" rel="noopener">Location 380&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we look at each person as we breathe in and out in order to be in touch with ourselves and everyone at the table. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=383" rel="noopener">Location 383&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After breathing, we smile. Sitting at the table with other people, we have a chance to offer an authentic smile of friendship and understanding. It is very easy, but not many people do it. To me, this is the most important practice. We look at each person and smile at him or her. Breathing and smiling together is a very important practice. If the people in a household cannot smile at each other, the situation is very dangerous. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=386" rel="noopener">Location 386&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After breathing and smiling, we look down at the food in a way that allows the food to become real. This food reveals our connection with the earth. Each bite contains the life of the sun and the earth. The extent to which our food reveals itself depends on us. We can see and taste the whole universe in a piece of bread! Contemplating our food for a few seconds before eating, and eating in mindfulness, can bring us much happiness. (

&lt;li>Having the opportunity to sit with our family and friends and enjoy wonderful food is something precious, something not everyone has. (

&lt;li>the idea that doing dishes is unpleasant can occur only when you aren’t doing them. Once you are standing in front of the sink with your sleeves rolled up and your hands in the warm water, it is really quite pleasant. I enjoy taking my time with each dish, being fully aware of the dish, the water, and each movement of my hands. I know that if I hurry in order to eat dessert sooner, the time of washing dishes will be unpleasant and not worth living. That would be a pity, for each minute, each second of life is a miracle. The dishes themselves and the fact that I am here washing them are miracles! (

&lt;li>Washing the dishes is at the same time a means and an end—that is, not only do we do the dishes in order to have clean dishes, we also do the dishes just to do the dishes, to live fully in each moment while washing them. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=423" rel="noopener">Location 423&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We feel that there is a vacuum in us and we don’t want to confront it. We don’t like being so busy, but every time we have a spare moment, we are afraid of being alone with ourselves. We want to escape. Either we turn on the television, pick up the telephone, read a novel, go out with a friend, or take the car and go somewhere. Our civilization teaches us to act this way and provides us with many things we can use to lose touch with ourselves. (

&lt;li>When you practice half an hour of sitting meditation a day, that time should be for all twenty-four hours, and not just for that half-hour. One smile, one breath, should be for the benefit of the whole day, not just for that moment. We must practice in a way that removes the barrier between practice and non-practice. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=510" rel="noopener">Location 510&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should be able to bring the practice from the meditation hall into our daily lives. We need to discuss among ourselves how to do it. Do you practice breathing between phone calls? Do you practice smiling while cutting carrots? Do you practice relaxation after hours of hard work? These are practical questions. If you know how to apply meditation to dinner time, leisure time, sleeping time, it will penetrate your daily life, and it will also have a tremendous effect on social concerns. Mindfulness can penetrate the activities of everyday life, each minute, each hour of our daily life, and not just be a description of something far away. (

&lt;li>The foundation of happiness is mindfulness. The basic condition for being happy is our consciousness of being happy. If we are not aware that we are happy, we are not really happy. (

&lt;li>When we have a toothache, we know that not having a toothache is a wonderful thing. But when we do not have a toothache, we are still not happy. A non-toothache is very pleasant. There are so many things that are enjoyable, but when we don’t practice mindfulness, we don’t appreciate them. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=549" rel="noopener">Location 549&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you can refrain from hoping, you can bring yourself entirely into the present moment and discover the joy that is already here. (

&lt;li>Western civilization places so much emphasis on the idea of hope that we sacrifice the present moment. Hope is for the future. It cannot help us discover joy, peace, or enlightenment in the present moment. Many religions are based on the notion of hope, and this teaching about refraining from hope may create a strong reaction. (

&lt;li>One day the Buddha held up a flower in front of an audience of 1,250 monks and nuns. He did not say anything for quite a long time. The audience was perfectly silent. Everyone seemed to be thinking hard, trying to see the meaning behind the Buddha’s gesture. Then, suddenly, the Buddha smiled. He smiled because someone in the audience smiled at him and at the flower. (

&lt;li>When we have an unpleasant feeling, we may want to chase it away. But it is more effective to return to our conscious breathing and just observe it, identifying it silently to ourselves: “Breathing in, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me. Breathing out, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me.” Calling a feeling by its name, such as “anger,” “sorrow,” “joy,” or “happiness,” helps us identify it clearly and recognize it more deeply. (

&lt;li>Mindful observation is based on the principle of “non-duality”: our feeling is not separate from us or caused merely by something outside us; our feeling is us, and for the moment we are that feeling. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=667" rel="noopener">Location 667&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our attitude of not clinging to or rejecting our feelings is the attitude of letting go, an important part of meditation practice. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=669" rel="noopener">Location 669&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A teacher has to give birth to the teacher within his student, and a psychotherapist has to give birth to the psychotherapist within his patient. The patient’s “internal psychotherapist” can then work full-time in a very effective way. (

&lt;li>After recognizing the feeling, becoming one with it, calming it down, and releasing it, we can look deeply into its causes, which are often based on inaccurate perceptions. As soon as we understand the causes and nature of our feelings, they begin to transform themselves. (

&lt;li>“Breathing in, I know that anger is in me. Breathing out, I know that I am my anger.” If we follow our breathing closely while we identify and mindfully observe our anger, it can no longer monopolize our consciousness. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=725" rel="noopener">Location 725&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Like a fireman, we have to pour water on the blaze first and not waste time looking for the one who set the house on fire. “Breathing in, I know that I am angry. Breathing out, I know that I must put all my energy into caring for my anger.” So we avoid thinking about the other person, and we refrain from doing or saying anything as long as our anger persists. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=734" rel="noopener">Location 734&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we are angry, our anger is our very self. To suppress or chase it away is to suppress or chase away our self. When we are joyful, we are the joy. When we are angry, we are the anger. When anger is born in us, we can be aware that anger is an energy in us, and we can accept that energy in order to transform it into another kind of energy. When we have a compost bin filled with organic material which is decomposing and smelly, we know that we can transform the waste into beautiful flowers. At first, we may see the compost and the flowers as opposite, but when we look deeply, we see that the flowers already exist in the compost, and the compost already exists in the flowers. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=737" rel="noopener">Location 737&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Breathing in, I know that anger is here. Breathing out, I know that the anger is me. Breathing in, I know that anger is unpleasant. Breathing out, I know this feeling will pass. Breathing in, I am calm. Breathing out, I am strong enough to take care of this anger. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=767" rel="noopener">Location 767&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we look into our anger, we can see its roots, such as misunderstanding, clumsiness, injustice, resentment, or conditioning. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=778" rel="noopener">Location 778&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we do not untie our knots when they form, they will grow tighter and stronger. Our conscious, reasoning mind knows that negative feelings such as anger, fear, and regret are not wholly acceptable to ourselves or society, so it finds ways to repress them, to push them into remote areas of our consciousness in order to forget them. Because we want to avoid suffering, we create defense mechanisms that deny the existence of these negative feelings and give us the impression we have peace within ourselves. But our internal formations are always looking for ways to manifest as destructive images, feelings, thoughts, words, or behavior. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=812" rel="noopener">Location 812&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we live with another person, to protect each other’s happiness, we should help one another transform the internal formations that we produce together. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=837" rel="noopener">Location 837&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Happiness is no longer an individual matter. If the other person is not happy, we will not be happy either. To transform the other person’s knots will help bring about our own happiness as well. A wife can create internal formations in her husband, and a husband can do so in his wife, and if they continue to create knots in each other, one day there will be no happiness left. Therefore, as soon as a knot is created, the wife, for example, should know that a knot has just been tied in her. She should not overlook it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=839" rel="noopener">Location 839&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Buddhism, the word “suchness” is used to mean “the essence or particular characteristics of a thing or a person, its true nature.” Each person has his or her suchness. If we want to live in peace and happiness with a person, we have to see the suchness of that person. Once we see it, we understand him or her, and there will be no trouble. We can live peacefully and happily together. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=848" rel="noopener">Location 848&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we bring natural gas into our homes for heating and cooking, we know the suchness of gas. We know that gas is dangerous—it can kill us if we are not mindful. But we also know that we need the gas in order to cook, so we do not hesitate to bring it into our homes. The same is true of electricity. We could get electrocuted by it, but when we are mindful, it can help us, and there is no problem, because we know something about the suchness of electricity. A person is the same. If we do not know enough about the suchness of that person, we may get ourselves into trouble. But if we know, then we can enjoy each other very much and benefit a lot from one another. The key is knowing a person’s suchness. We do not expect a person always to be a flower. We have to understand his or her garbage as well. (

&lt;li>Before he left Vietnam forty years ago, his mother held his hand and told him, “Whenever you miss me, look into your hand, and you will see me immediately.” (

&lt;li>But I believe that the parents did not mean to plant those seeds. They did not intend to make their children suffer. Maybe they received the same kind of seeds from their parents. There is a continuation in the transmission of seeds, and their father and mother might have gotten those seeds from their grandfather and grandmother. Most of us are victims of a kind of living that is not mindful, and the practice of mindful living, of meditation, can stop these kinds of suffering and end the transmission of such sorrow to our children and grandchildren. We can break the cycle by not allowing these kinds of seeds of suffering to be transmitted to our children, our friends, or anyone else. (

&lt;li>When we look at our parents with compassion, often we see that our parents are only victims who never had the chance to practice mindfulness. They could not transform the suffering in themselves. But if we see them with compassionate eyes, we can offer them joy, peace, and forgiveness. In fact, when we look deeply, we discover that it is impossible to drop all identity with our parents. (

&lt;li>Every time a seed has an occasion to manifest itself, it produces new seeds of the same kind. If we are angry for five minutes, new seeds of anger are produced and deposited in the soil of our unconscious mind during those five minutes. That is why we have to be careful in selecting the kind of life we lead and the emotions we express. When I smile, the seeds of smiling and joy have come up. (

&lt;li>We often ask, “What’s wrong?” Doing so, we invite painful seeds of sorrow to come up and manifest. We feel suffering, anger, and depression, and produce more such seeds. We would be much happier if we tried to stay in touch with the healthy, joyful seeds inside of us and around us. We should learn to ask, “What’s not wrong?” and be in touch with that. (

&lt;li>Life is filled with many wonders, like the blue sky, the sunshine, the eyes of a baby. Our breathing, for example, can be very enjoyable. I enjoy breathing every day. But many people appreciate the joy of breathing only when they have asthma or a stuffed-up nose. We don’t need to wait until we have asthma to enjoy our breathing. (

&lt;li>Awareness of the precious elements of happiness is itself the practice of right mindfulness. Elements like these are within us and all around us. In each second of our lives we can enjoy them. If we do so, seeds of peace, joy, and happiness will be planted in us, and they will become strong. The secret to happiness is happiness itself. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=950" rel="noopener">Location 950&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don’t blame the lettuce. You look into the reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or our family, we blame the other person. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=955" rel="noopener">Location 955&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and arguments. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=958" rel="noopener">Location 958&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you understand, you cannot help but love. You cannot get angry. To develop understanding, you have to practice looking at all living beings with the eyes of compassion. When you understand, you cannot help but love. And when you love, you naturally act in a way that can relieve the suffering of people. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=971" rel="noopener">Location 971&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we are in contact with another’s suffering, a feeling of compassion is born in us. Compassion means, literally, “to suffer with.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=992" rel="noopener">Location 992&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We can also meditate on the suffering of those who cause us to suffer. Anyone who has made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need to follow our breathing and look deeply, and naturally we will see his suffering. A part of his difficulties and sorrows may have been brought about by his parents’ lack of skill when he was still young. But his parents themselves may have been victims of their parents; the suffering has been transmitted from generation to generation and been reborn in him. If we see that, we will no longer blame him for making us suffer, because we know that he is also a victim. (

&lt;li>So when you hug your child, your friend, your spouse, I recommend that you first breathe in and out consciously and return to the present moment. Then, while you hold him or her in your arms, breathe three times consciously, and you will enjoy your hugging more than ever before. (

&lt;li>If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot be here either. (

&lt;li>Real strength is not in power, money, or weapons, but in deep, inner peace. (

&lt;li>When we sit down to dinner and look at our plate filled with fragrant and appetizing food, we can nourish our awareness of the bitter pain of people who suffer from hunger. (

&lt;li>Before each meal, we can join our palms in mindfulness and think about the children who do not have enough to eat. Doing so will help us maintain mindfulness of our good fortune, and perhaps one day we will find ways to do something to help change the system of injustice that exists in the world. (

&lt;li>If we cannot smile, we cannot help other people smile. If we are not peaceful, then we cannot contribute to the peace movement. (

&lt;li>Meditation is to look deeply into things and to see how we can change ourselves and how we can transform our situation. To transform our situation is also to transform our minds. To transform our minds is also to transform our situation, because the situation is mind, and mind is situation. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=1287" rel="noopener">Location 1287&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>During any conflict, we need people who can understand the suffering of all sides. For example, if a number of people in South Africa could go to each side and understand their suffering, and communicate that to the other sides, that would be very helpful. We need links. We need communication. Practicing nonviolence is first of all to become nonviolence. Then when a difficult situation presents itself, we will react in a way that will help the situation. This applies to problems of the family as well as to problems of society. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=1322" rel="noopener">Location 1322&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“I am sorry, I hurt you out of my ignorance, out of my lack of mindfulness, out of my lack of skillfulness. I will try my best to change myself. I don’t dare to say anything more to you.” Sometimes, we do not have the intention to hurt, but because we are not mindful or skillful enough, we hurt someone. (

&lt;li>The second thing to do is to try to bring out the best part in ourselves, the part of the flower, to transform ourselves. That is the only way to demonstrate what you have just said. When you have become fresh and pleasant, the other person will notice very soon. Then when there is a chance to approach that person, you can come to her as a flower and she will notice immediately that you are quite different. You may not have to say anything. Just seeing you like that, she will accept you and forgive you. That is called “speaking with your life and not just with words.” (

&lt;li>We are very good at preparing to live, but not very good at living. We know how to sacrifice ten years for a diploma, and we are willing to work very hard to get a job, a car, a house, and so on. But we have difficulty remembering that we are alive in the present moment, the only moment there is for us to be alive. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=187" rel="noopener">Location 187&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yet even a smile like that is enough to relax all the muscles in our face, to banish all worries and fatigue. A tiny bud of a smile on our lips nourishes awareness and calms us miraculously. It returns to us the peace we thought we had lost. (

&lt;li>Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile. Dwelling in the present moment, I know this is a wonderful moment! (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=236" rel="noopener">Location 236&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>According to the method of conscious breathing, when we breathe in and out, we stop thinking, because saying “In” and “Out” is not thinking—“In” and “Out” are only words to help us concentrate on our breathing. If we keep breathing in and out this way for a few minutes, we become quite refreshed. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=257" rel="noopener">Location 257&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Watching a bad TV program, we become the TV program. We are what we feel and perceive. If we are angry, we are the anger. If we are in love, we are love. If we look at a snow-covered mountain peak, we are the mountain. (

&lt;li>You can use any sound to remind you to pause, breathe in and out, and enjoy the present moment. The buzzer that goes off when you forget to fasten the seat belt in your car is a bell of mindfulness. Even non-sounds, such as the rays of sunlight coming through the window, are bells of mindfulness that can remind us to return to ourselves, breathe, smile, and live fully in the present moment. (

&lt;li>When I was four years old, my mother used to bring me a cookie every time she came home from the market. I always went to the front yard and took my time eating it, sometimes half an hour or forty-five minutes for one cookie. I would take a small bite and look up at the sky. Then I would touch the dog with my feet and take another small bite. I just enjoyed being there, with the sky, the earth, the bamboo thickets, the cat, the dog, the flowers. I was able to do that because I did not have much to worry about. I did not think of the future, I did not regret the past. I was entirely in the present moment, with my cookie, the dog, the bamboo thickets, the cat, and everything. (

&lt;li>Eating mindfully is a most important practice of meditation. We can eat in a way that we restore the cookie of our childhood. The present moment is filled with joy and happiness. If you are attentive, you will see it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=354" rel="noopener">Location 354&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We each looked at our tangerine, and the children were invited to meditate on its origins. They saw not only their tangerine, but also its mother, the tangerine tree. With some guidance, they began to visualize the blossoms in the sunshine and in the rain. Then they saw petals falling down and the tiny green fruit appear. The sunshine and the rain continued, and the tiny tangerine grew. Now someone has picked it, and the tangerine is here. After seeing this, each child was invited to peel the tangerine slowly, noticing the mist and the fragrance of the tangerine, and then bring it up to his or her mouth and have a mindful bite, in full awareness of the texture and taste of the fruit and the juice coming out. We ate slowly like that. Each time you look at a tangerine, you can see deeply into it. You can see everything in the universe in one tangerine. When you peel it and smell it, it’s wonderful. You can take your time eating a tangerine and be very happy. (

&lt;li>In our daily lives, we may see the people around us, but if we lack mindfulness, they are just phantoms, not real people, and we ourselves are also ghosts. Practicing mindfulness enables us to become a real person. When we are a real person, we see real people around us, and life is present in all its richness. The practice of eating bread, a tangerine, or a cookie is the same. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=371" rel="noopener">Location 371&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“The purpose of eating breakfast is to eat breakfast.” (

&lt;li>Eating a meal in mindfulness is an important practice. We turn off the TV, put down our newspaper, and work together for five or ten minutes, setting the table and finishing whatever needs to be done. During these few minutes, we can be very happy. When the food is on the table and everyone is seated, we practice breathing: “Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile,” three times. We can recover ourselves completely after three breaths like this. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=380" rel="noopener">Location 380&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we look at each person as we breathe in and out in order to be in touch with ourselves and everyone at the table. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=383" rel="noopener">Location 383&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After breathing, we smile. Sitting at the table with other people, we have a chance to offer an authentic smile of friendship and understanding. It is very easy, but not many people do it. To me, this is the most important practice. We look at each person and smile at him or her. Breathing and smiling together is a very important practice. If the people in a household cannot smile at each other, the situation is very dangerous. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=386" rel="noopener">Location 386&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After breathing and smiling, we look down at the food in a way that allows the food to become real. This food reveals our connection with the earth. Each bite contains the life of the sun and the earth. The extent to which our food reveals itself depends on us. We can see and taste the whole universe in a piece of bread! Contemplating our food for a few seconds before eating, and eating in mindfulness, can bring us much happiness. (

&lt;li>Having the opportunity to sit with our family and friends and enjoy wonderful food is something precious, something not everyone has. (

&lt;li>the idea that doing dishes is unpleasant can occur only when you aren’t doing them. Once you are standing in front of the sink with your sleeves rolled up and your hands in the warm water, it is really quite pleasant. I enjoy taking my time with each dish, being fully aware of the dish, the water, and each movement of my hands. I know that if I hurry in order to eat dessert sooner, the time of washing dishes will be unpleasant and not worth living. That would be a pity, for each minute, each second of life is a miracle. The dishes themselves and the fact that I am here washing them are miracles! (

&lt;li>Washing the dishes is at the same time a means and an end—that is, not only do we do the dishes in order to have clean dishes, we also do the dishes just to do the dishes, to live fully in each moment while washing them. (

&lt;li>We feel that there is a vacuum in us and we don’t want to confront it. We don’t like being so busy, but every time we have a spare moment, we are afraid of being alone with ourselves. We want to escape. Either we turn on the television, pick up the telephone, read a novel, go out with a friend, or take the car and go somewhere. Our civilization teaches us to act this way and provides us with many things we can use to lose touch with ourselves. (

&lt;li>When you practice half an hour of sitting meditation a day, that time should be for all twenty-four hours, and not just for that half-hour. One smile, one breath, should be for the benefit of the whole day, not just for that moment. We must practice in a way that removes the barrier between practice and non-practice. (

&lt;li>We should be able to bring the practice from the meditation hall into our daily lives. We need to discuss among ourselves how to do it. Do you practice breathing between phone calls? Do you practice smiling while cutting carrots? Do you practice relaxation after hours of hard work? These are practical questions. If you know how to apply meditation to dinner time, leisure time, sleeping time, it will penetrate your daily life, and it will also have a tremendous effect on social concerns. Mindfulness can penetrate the activities of everyday life, each minute, each hour of our daily life, and not just be a description of something far away. (

&lt;li>The foundation of happiness is mindfulness. The basic condition for being happy is our consciousness of being happy. If we are not aware that we are happy, we are not really happy. (

&lt;li>When we have a toothache, we know that not having a toothache is a wonderful thing. But when we do not have a toothache, we are still not happy. A non-toothache is very pleasant. There are so many things that are enjoyable, but when we don’t practice mindfulness, we don’t appreciate them. (

&lt;li>If you can refrain from hoping, you can bring yourself entirely into the present moment and discover the joy that is already here. (

&lt;li>Western civilization places so much emphasis on the idea of hope that we sacrifice the present moment. Hope is for the future. It cannot help us discover joy, peace, or enlightenment in the present moment. Many religions are based on the notion of hope, and this teaching about refraining from hope may create a strong reaction. (

&lt;li>One day the Buddha held up a flower in front of an audience of 1,250 monks and nuns. He did not say anything for quite a long time. The audience was perfectly silent. Everyone seemed to be thinking hard, trying to see the meaning behind the Buddha’s gesture. Then, suddenly, the Buddha smiled. He smiled because someone in the audience smiled at him and at the flower. (

&lt;li>When we have an unpleasant feeling, we may want to chase it away. But it is more effective to return to our conscious breathing and just observe it, identifying it silently to ourselves: “Breathing in, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me. Breathing out, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me.” Calling a feeling by its name, such as “anger,” “sorrow,” “joy,” or “happiness,” helps us identify it clearly and recognize it more deeply.

&lt;li>Mindful observation is based on the principle of “non-duality”: our feeling is not separate from us or caused merely by something outside us; our feeling is us, and for the moment we are that feeling. (

&lt;li>Our attitude of not clinging to or rejecting our feelings is the attitude of letting go, an important part of meditation practice. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=669" rel="noopener">Location 669&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A teacher has to give birth to the teacher within his student, and a psychotherapist has to give birth to the psychotherapist within his patient. The patient’s “internal psychotherapist” can then work full-time in a very effective way. (

&lt;li>After recognizing the feeling, becoming one with it, calming it down, and releasing it, we can look deeply into its causes, which are often based on inaccurate perceptions. As soon as we understand the causes and nature of our feelings, they begin to transform themselves. (

&lt;li>“Breathing in, I know that anger is in me. Breathing out, I know that I am my anger.” If we follow our breathing closely while we identify and mindfully observe our anger, it can no longer monopolize our consciousness. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=725" rel="noopener">Location 725&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Like a fireman, we have to pour water on the blaze first and not waste time looking for the one who set the house on fire. “Breathing in, I know that I am angry. Breathing out, I know that I must put all my energy into caring for my anger.” So we avoid thinking about the other person, and we refrain from doing or saying anything as long as our anger persists. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=734" rel="noopener">Location 734&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we are angry, our anger is our very self. To suppress or chase it away is to suppress or chase away our self. When we are joyful, we are the joy. When we are angry, we are the anger. When anger is born in us, we can be aware that anger is an energy in us, and we can accept that energy in order to transform it into another kind of energy. When we have a compost bin filled with organic material which is decomposing and smelly, we know that we can transform the waste into beautiful flowers. At first, we may see the compost and the flowers as opposite, but when we look deeply, we see that the flowers already exist in the compost, and the compost already exists in the flowers. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=737" rel="noopener">Location 737&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Breathing in, I know that anger is here. Breathing out, I know that the anger is me. Breathing in, I know that anger is unpleasant. Breathing out, I know this feeling will pass. Breathing in, I am calm. Breathing out, I am strong enough to take care of this anger. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=767" rel="noopener">Location 767&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we look into our anger, we can see its roots, such as misunderstanding, clumsiness, injustice, resentment, or conditioning. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=778" rel="noopener">Location 778&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we do not untie our knots when they form, they will grow tighter and stronger. Our conscious, reasoning mind knows that negative feelings such as anger, fear, and regret are not wholly acceptable to ourselves or society, so it finds ways to repress them, to push them into remote areas of our consciousness in order to forget them. Because we want to avoid suffering, we create defense mechanisms that deny the existence of these negative feelings and give us the impression we have peace within ourselves. But our internal formations are always looking for ways to manifest as destructive images, feelings, thoughts, words, or behavior. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=812" rel="noopener">Location 812&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we live with another person, to protect each other’s happiness, we should help one another transform the internal formations that we produce together. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=837" rel="noopener">Location 837&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Happiness is no longer an individual matter. If the other person is not happy, we will not be happy either. To transform the other person’s knots will help bring about our own happiness as well. A wife can create internal formations in her husband, and a husband can do so in his wife, and if they continue to create knots in each other, one day there will be no happiness left. Therefore, as soon as a knot is created, the wife, for example, should know that a knot has just been tied in her. She should not overlook it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=839" rel="noopener">Location 839&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Buddhism, the word “suchness” is used to mean “the essence or particular characteristics of a thing or a person, its true nature.” Each person has his or her suchness. If we want to live in peace and happiness with a person, we have to see the suchness of that person. Once we see it, we understand him or her, and there will be no trouble. We can live peacefully and happily together. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=848" rel="noopener">Location 848&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we bring natural gas into our homes for heating and cooking, we know the suchness of gas. We know that gas is dangerous—it can kill us if we are not mindful. But we also know that we need the gas in order to cook, so we do not hesitate to bring it into our homes. The same is true of electricity. We could get electrocuted by it, but when we are mindful, it can help us, and there is no problem, because we know something about the suchness of electricity. A person is the same. If we do not know enough about the suchness of that person, we may get ourselves into trouble. But if we know, then we can enjoy each other very much and benefit a lot from one another. The key is knowing a person’s suchness. We do not expect a person always to be a flower. We have to understand his or her garbage as well. (

&lt;li>Before he left Vietnam forty years ago, his mother held his hand and told him, “Whenever you miss me, look into your hand, and you will see me immediately.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=859" rel="noopener">Location 859&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But I believe that the parents did not mean to plant those seeds. They did not intend to make their children suffer. Maybe they received the same kind of seeds from their parents. There is a continuation in the transmission of seeds, and their father and mother might have gotten those seeds from their grandfather and grandmother. Most of us are victims of a kind of living that is not mindful, and the practice of mindful living, of meditation, can stop these kinds of suffering and end the transmission of such sorrow to our children and grandchildren. We can break the cycle by not allowing these kinds of seeds of suffering to be transmitted to our children, our friends, or anyone else. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=871" rel="noopener">Location 871&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we look at our parents with compassion, often we see that our parents are only victims who never had the chance to practice mindfulness. They could not transform the suffering in themselves. But if we see them with compassionate eyes, we can offer them joy, peace, and forgiveness. In fact, when we look deeply, we discover that it is impossible to drop all identity with our parents. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=889" rel="noopener">Location 889&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every time a seed has an occasion to manifest itself, it produces new seeds of the same kind. If we are angry for five minutes, new seeds of anger are produced and deposited in the soil of our unconscious mind during those five minutes. That is why we have to be careful in selecting the kind of life we lead and the emotions we express. When I smile, the seeds of smiling and joy have come up. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=903" rel="noopener">Location 903&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We often ask, “What’s wrong?” Doing so, we invite painful seeds of sorrow to come up and manifest. We feel suffering, anger, and depression, and produce more such seeds. We would be much happier if we tried to stay in touch with the healthy, joyful seeds inside of us and around us. We should learn to ask, “What’s not wrong?” and be in touch with that. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=943" rel="noopener">Location 943&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life is filled with many wonders, like the blue sky, the sunshine, the eyes of a baby. Our breathing, for example, can be very enjoyable. I enjoy breathing every day. But many people appreciate the joy of breathing only when they have asthma or a stuffed-up nose. We don’t need to wait until we have asthma to enjoy our breathing. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=947" rel="noopener">Location 947&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Awareness of the precious elements of happiness is itself the practice of right mindfulness. Elements like these are within us and all around us. In each second of our lives we can enjoy them. If we do so, seeds of peace, joy, and happiness will be planted in us, and they will become strong. The secret to happiness is happiness itself. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=950" rel="noopener">Location 950&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don’t blame the lettuce. You look into the reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or our family, we blame the other person. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=955" rel="noopener">Location 955&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and arguments. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=958" rel="noopener">Location 958&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you understand, you cannot help but love. You cannot get angry. To develop understanding, you have to practice looking at all living beings with the eyes of compassion. When you understand, you cannot help but love. And when you love, you naturally act in a way that can relieve the suffering of people. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=971" rel="noopener">Location 971&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we are in contact with another’s suffering, a feeling of compassion is born in us. Compassion means, literally, “to suffer with.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=992" rel="noopener">Location 992&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We can also meditate on the suffering of those who cause us to suffer. Anyone who has made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need to follow our breathing and look deeply, and naturally we will see his suffering. A part of his difficulties and sorrows may have been brought about by his parents’ lack of skill when he was still young. But his parents themselves may have been victims of their parents; the suffering has been transmitted from generation to generation and been reborn in him. If we see that, we will no longer blame him for making us suffer, because we know that he is also a victim. (

&lt;li>So when you hug your child, your friend, your spouse, I recommend that you first breathe in and out consciously and return to the present moment. Then, while you hold him or her in your arms, breathe three times consciously, and you will enjoy your hugging more than ever before. (

&lt;li>If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot be here either. (

&lt;li>Real strength is not in power, money, or weapons, but in deep, inner peace. (

&lt;li>When we sit down to dinner and look at our plate filled with fragrant and appetizing food, we can nourish our awareness of the bitter pain of people who suffer from hunger. (

&lt;li>Before each meal, we can join our palms in mindfulness and think about the children who do not have enough to eat. Doing so will help us maintain mindfulness of our good fortune, and perhaps one day we will find ways to do something to help change the system of injustice that exists in the world. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=1259" rel="noopener">Location 1259&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we cannot smile, we cannot help other people smile. If we are not peaceful, then we cannot contribute to the peace movement. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=1273" rel="noopener">Location 1273&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation is to look deeply into things and to see how we can change ourselves and how we can transform our situation. To transform our situation is also to transform our minds. To transform our minds is also to transform our situation, because the situation is mind, and mind is situation. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=1287" rel="noopener">Location 1287&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>During any conflict, we need people who can understand the suffering of all sides. For example, if a number of people in South Africa could go to each side and understand their suffering, and communicate that to the other sides, that would be very helpful. We need links. We need communication. Practicing nonviolence is first of all to become nonviolence. Then when a difficult situation presents itself, we will react in a way that will help the situation. This applies to problems of the family as well as to problems of society. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=1322" rel="noopener">Location 1322&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“I am sorry, I hurt you out of my ignorance, out of my lack of mindfulness, out of my lack of skillfulness. I will try my best to change myself. I don’t dare to say anything more to you.” Sometimes, we do not have the intention to hurt, but because we are not mindful or skillful enough, we hurt someone. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0038AUYSW&amp;amp;location=1368" rel="noopener">Location 1368&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The second thing to do is to try to bring out the best part in ourselves, the part of the flower, to transform ourselves. That is the only way to demonstrate what you have just said. When you have become fresh and pleasant, the other person will notice very soon. Then when there is a chance to approach that person, you can come to her as a flower and she will notice immediately that you are quite different. You may not have to say anything. Just seeing you like that, she will accept you and forgive you. That is called “speaking with your life and not just with words.” (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>meditation is essentially training our attention so that we can be more aware—not only of our own inner workings but also of what’s happening around us in the here and now. Once we see clearly what’s going on in the moment, we can then choose whether and how to act on what we’re seeing. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=260" rel="noopener">Location 260&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>whatever gets our attention flourishes, so if we lavish attention on the negative and inconsequential, they can overwhelm the positive and the meaningful. But if we do the opposite, refusing to deal with or acknowledge what’s difficult and painful, pretending it doesn’t exist, then our world is out of whack. Whatever doesn’t get our attention withers—or retreats below conscious awareness, where it may still affect our lives. In a perverse way, ignoring the painful and the difficult is just another way of feeding the wolf. Meditation teaches us to open our attention to all of human experience and all parts of ourselves. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=282" rel="noopener">Location 282&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the feeling of having your attention fractured by job and family, the enticement of electronic diversions, or the chatter of your mind—that morning’s spat with your mate replaying in your head, a litany of worries about the future or regrets about the past, a nervous endless-loop recitation of the day’s to-do list. Parts of that mental soundtrack may be old tapes that were instilled in childhood and have been playing so long we’ve nearly tuned them out of conscious awareness. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=287" rel="noopener">Location 287&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation teaches us to focus and to pay clear attention to our experiences and responses as they arise, and to observe them without judging them. That allows us to detect harmful habits of mind that were previously invisible to us. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=300" rel="noopener">Location 300&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All forms of meditation strengthen and direct our attention through the cultivation of three key skills—concentration, mindfulness, and compassion or lovingkindness. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=306" rel="noopener">Location 306&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The practice entails paying attention to each in-and-out breath, and when your mind wanders (it will, that’s natural), noticing whatever has captured your attention, then letting go of the thought or feeling without berating yourself for it. You then return to focusing on your breathing. In this way meditation trains us to stay in the moment before us instead of reliving the past or worrying about the future. And it teaches us how to be gentle with ourselves and others, to forgive our lapses and move (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=310" rel="noopener">Location 310&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But if we apply mindfulness to the experience of anger, we can safely draw close to the emotion instead of fleeing, and investigate it instead of stonewalling. We notice it without judging it. We can gather more information about what happens when we get mad—what sets off the anger, where it lodges in the body, and what else it also contains, like sadness, fear, or regret. This pause for nonjudgmental acknowledgment creates a bit of peaceful space within which we can make new, different choices about how to respond to something like anger. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=324" rel="noopener">Location 324&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mindfulness helps us get better at seeing the difference between what’s happening and the stories we tell ourselves about what’s happening, stories that get in the way of direct experience. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=331" rel="noopener">Location 331&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you meditate regularly, you also get certain results. I’ve already mentioned some of them, including greater calm, and improved concentration and more connection to others. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=395" rel="noopener">Location 395&lt;/a>)

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll begin to spot the unexamined assumptions that get in the way of happiness. These assumptions we make about who we are and the way the world works—what we deserve, how much we can handle, where happiness is to be found, whether or not positive change is possible—all greatly influence how and to what we pay attention. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=398" rel="noopener">Location 398&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Assumptions block direct experience and prevent us from gathering information that could bring us comfort and relief, or information that, though saddening and painful, will allow us to make better decisions. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=406" rel="noopener">Location 406&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll stop limiting yourself. When we practice meditation, we often begin to recognize a specific sort of conditioned response—previously undetected restrictions we’ve imposed on our lives. We spot the ways we sabotage our own growth and success because we’ve been conditioned to be content with meager results. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=414" rel="noopener">Location 414&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll weather hard times better. Meditation teaches us safe ways to open ourselves to the full range of experience—painful, pleasurable, and neutral—so we can learn how to be a friend to ourselves in good times and bad. During meditation sessions we practice being with difficult emotions and thoughts, even frightening or intense ones, in an open and accepting way, without adding self-criticism to something that already hurts. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=421" rel="noopener">Location 421&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll rediscover a deeper sense of what’s really important to you. Once you look beneath distractions and conditioned reactions, you’ll have a clearer view of your deepest, most enduring dreams, goals, and values. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=429" rel="noopener">Location 429&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll have a portable emergency resource. Meditation is the ultimate mobile device; you can use it anywhere, anytime, unobtrusively. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=431" rel="noopener">Location 431&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll be in closer touch with the best parts of yourself. Meditation practice cultivates qualities such as kindness, trust, and wisdom that you may think are missing from your makeup but are actually just undeveloped or obscured by stress and distractions. You’ll have the chance to access these qualities more easily and frequently. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=435" rel="noopener">Location 435&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll recapture the energy you’ve been wasting trying to control the uncontrollable. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=438" rel="noopener">Location 438&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Though we can affect our physical and emotional experiences, we can’t ultimately determine them; we can’t decree what emotions will arise within us. But we can learn through meditation to change our responses to them. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=447" rel="noopener">Location 447&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recognizing what we can’t control (the feelings that arise within us; other people; the weather) helps us have healthier boundaries at work and at home—no more trying to reform everyone all the time. It helps us to stop beating up on ourselves for having perfectly human emotions. It frees energy we expend on trying to control the uncontrollable. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=449" rel="noopener">Location 449&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll understand how to relate to change better—to accept that it’s inevitable and believe that it’s possible. Most of us have a mixed, often paradoxical attitude toward change. Some of us don’t think change is possible at all; we believe we’re stuck forever doing things the way we’ve always done them. Some of us simultaneously hope for change and fear it. We want to believe that change is possible, because that means that our lives can get better. But we also have trouble accepting change, because we want to hold on permanently to what’s pleasurable and positive. We’d like difficulties to be fleeting and comfort to stick around. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=452" rel="noopener">Location 452&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everything is impermanent: happiness, sorrow, a great meal, a powerful empire, what we’re feeling, the people around us, ourselves. Meditation helps us comprehend this fact—perhaps the basic truth of human existence, and the one we humans are most likely to balk at or be oblivious to, especially when it comes to the biggest change of all: Mortality happens, whether we like it or not. We grow old and die. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=458" rel="noopener">Location 458&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Following our breath while observing how thoughts continually ebb and flow can help us realize that all elements of our experience are in constant flux. During a meditation session, you’ll find it’s natural to go through many ups and downs, to encounter both new delights and newly awakened conflicts that have bubbled up from the unconscious mind. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=464" rel="noopener">Location 464&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We can’t control what thoughts and emotions arise within us, nor can we control the universal truth that everything changes. But we can learn to step back and rest in the awareness of what’s happening. That awareness can be our refuge. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=475" rel="noopener">Location 475&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“I’ve been through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened,” Mark Twain once said. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=601" rel="noopener">Location 601&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation—training our attention—allows us to find an essential cohesiveness. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=637" rel="noopener">Location 637&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thoughts and feelings will inevitably arise and claim your attention, but you’ll practice repeatedly noticing and letting go of these distractions, then returning your awareness to the in and out of your breath. Breathing, discovering you’ve been distracted, and starting over: simple and manageable. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=694" rel="noopener">Location 694&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some of these thoughts and feelings may be fascinating and delightful; some may make you uncomfortable; some may be deadly dull. You’ll practice letting them all go, without taking the time to judge them. This is a crucial first step in learning how to be more centered and present. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=696" rel="noopener">Location 696&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everyone who meditates, beginners and longer-term practitioners alike, gets hijacked at times by thoughts and feelings; it’s impossible not to be. But once you see how doable it is to start over, you won’t judge your efforts so harshly. And you’ll learn that starting over and not fruitlessly berating yourself are skills you can bring into your everyday life when you’ve made a mistake or lost sight of your aspirations. You can begin again. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=700" rel="noopener">Location 700&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This act of beginning again is the essential art of the meditation practice. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=778" rel="noopener">Location 778&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you have to let go of distractions and begin again thousands of times, fine. That’s not a roadblock to the practice—that is the practice. That’s life: starting over, one breath at a time. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=790" rel="noopener">Location 790&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Try to bring some of the qualities of concentration you just experienced—presence, calm observation, willingness to start over, and gentleness—to the next activity that you perform at home, at work, among friends, or among strangers. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=797" rel="noopener">Location 797&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>success in meditation is measured not in terms of what is happening to us but by how we relate to what is happening. Do you calmly observe your sleepiness, anxiety, or distraction? Success. Do you try to stop punishing yourself for feeling these things? Success. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=899" rel="noopener">Location 899&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not paying attention keeps us in an endless cycle of wanting. We move on to the next thing because we aren’t really taking in what we already have; inattention creates an escalating need for stimulation. When we’re keenly aware of what’s happening, we don’t need to grasp for the next great moment of sensation or taste or sound (all the while missing what’s actually here, right in front of us). Nor do we need to postpone our feeling of happiness until a more exciting or more pleasing object comes along, (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=907" rel="noopener">Location 907&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>His life is a pursuit of a pursuit forever. It is the future that creates his present. All is an interminable chain of longing. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=915" rel="noopener">Location 915&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Imagine eating an apple. If you do so paying very little attention to the sight of it, the feel, the smell and the taste, then eating the apple isn’t likely to be a fulfilling experience. Becoming aware of a mild discontent, you’re likely to blame the apple for being boring and commonplace. It’s easy to miss the fact that the quality of your attention played a major role in your dissatisfaction. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=920" rel="noopener">Location 920&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Learning to deepen our concentration allows us to look at the world with quiet eyes. We don’t need to reach out and grab ever more exotic or forbidden fruit. We develop calm and tranquility—and the calmer we get, the more at home we feel with our body and mind, with life as it is. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=938" rel="noopener">Location 938&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The point of meditation is not to annihilate thoughts; obviously there are plenty of times in life when thinking is called for—vital, in fact, to our survival. What we hope to learn is the difference between thinking and being lost in thought. We don’t want to stop our thoughts but to change our relationship with them—to be more present and aware when we’re thinking. If we’re aware of what we’re thinking, if we see clearly what’s going on in our minds, then we can choose whether and how to act on our thoughts. (

&lt;li>Thoughts moving through your mind are like clouds moving across the sky. They are not the sky, and the sky remains unchanged by them. The way to be with them is just to watch them go by. That’s not generally how we experience our thoughts, but that’s what you’re working toward. (

&lt;li>Meditation is a microcosm, a model, and a mirror. The skills we practice when we sit are transferable to the rest of our lives. In Week One we used the tool of concentration to steady and focus the mind. Following the breath, we became aware of thoughts, feelings, and sensations. We noted them and let them go without getting swept away by them, without dodging them or ignoring them (as we might normally have done in our busy daily lives), and without berating ourselves for having them. (

&lt;li>DEVELOPING OUR CONCENTRATION helps us steady our attention. The next skill we’ll develop, mindfulness, helps us to free our attention from burdens we may not even know we’re hauling around. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1122" rel="noopener">Location 1122&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How many times has an attempt to dodge pain made us miss the sweet parts of bittersweet—the chance to grow in response to a challenge, to help others or accept help from others? How many pleasures escape our notice because we think we need big, dramatic sensations to feel alive? Mindfulness can allow us to experience fully the moment in front of us—what Thoreau calls “the bloom of the present”—and to wake up from neutral so we don’t miss the small, rich moments that add up to a dimensional life. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1401" rel="noopener">Location 1401&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mindfulness isn’t difficult; we just need to remember to do it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1466" rel="noopener">Location 1466&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Often people think, I don’t have the right kind of mindfulness, the right level of concentration. Progress is not about levels; it’s about frequency. If we can remember to be mindful, if we can add more moments of mindfulness, that makes all the difference. Countless times a day we lose mindfulness and become lost in reaction or disconnected from what is happening. But the moment we recognize that we’ve lost mindfulness, we have already regained it; that recognition is its essence. We can begin again. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1472" rel="noopener">Location 1472&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I’VE HEARD SOME WONDERFUL EXPLANATIONS of mindfulness. Sylvia Boorstein, a writer and teacher, calls it “awake attention to what is happening inside and outside so we can respond from a place of wisdom.” The Vietnamese Zen teacher and poet Thich Nhat Hanh says, “I like to define mindfulness as the energy that helps us to be there one hundred percent; the energy of our true presence.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1479" rel="noopener">Location 1479&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>core group of unhealthy human tendencies that are obstacles to happiness. They’re the states of mind that distract us in meditation practice, and trip us up in the rest of our lives. Broadly speaking, they are: desire, aversion, sloth, restlessness, and doubt. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1551" rel="noopener">Location 1551&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You may recognize that the thoughts and emotions that come up in this week’s meditations are part of recurring patterns—that you’re hearing a lot of what I call old tapes, the familiar, habitual mental soundtrack I mentioned in the introduction. It’s helpful to acknowledge these tapes of ours, perhaps even to good-naturedly name them: Oh, (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1752" rel="noopener">Location 1752&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>During the meditation about a difficult situation, as I pictured that day, I realized how familiar that ‘one false move and I’m doomed’ feeling is. I don’t know yet why I play that tape—but at least now I know it happens.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1765" rel="noopener">Location 1765&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The fourth-century Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu told this story: There was a man so displeased by the sight of his own shadow and footsteps that he determined to get rid of both by running away from them. But every time he put down his foot, there was another step, and his shadow kept up with him without the slightest difficulty. He thought he must not be running fast enough. So he ran faster and faster and faster, without stopping, until he finally dropped dead of exhaustion. He failed to realize that if he merely stepped into the shade, his shadow would vanish, and if he sat down and stayed still, there would be no more footsteps. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1777" rel="noopener">Location 1777&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Practicing mindfulness meditation is making the choice to be still—to step into the quiet shade instead of running away from difficult thoughts and feelings. We sometimes call meditation non-doing. Instead of being swept away by our usual conditioned reactions, we’re quiet and watchful, fully present with what is, touching it deeply, being touched by it, and seeing what is happening in the simplest and most direct fashion possible. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1782" rel="noopener">Location 1782&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And being mindful of the moment doesn’t mean that we give up savoring memories or setting goals. I like to quote Thich Nhat Hanh: “To dwell in the here and now does not mean you never think about the past or responsibly plan for the future,” he says. “The idea is simply not to allow yourself to get lost in regrets about the past or worries about the future. If you are firmly grounded in the present moment, the past can be an object of inquiry, the object of your mindfulness and concentration. You can attain many insights by looking into the past. But you are still grounded in the present moment.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1880" rel="noopener">Location 1880&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we know our thoughts, we neither dodge them nor get lost in them. Instead, we can decide when and if we should act on them; we can better discern which actions will lead to happiness and which to suffering. Meditation allows us to see and accept ourselves as we are in the moment—sometimes hot-tempered and sometimes mellow, sometimes cowardly and sometimes strong, sometimes ashamed and sometimes proud, sometimes confused and sometimes clear. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1947" rel="noopener">Location 1947&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The customary phrases are usually variations on May I Be Safe (or May I Be Free from Danger), May I Be Happy, May I Be Healthy, May I Live with Ease—may daily life not be a struggle. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=2047" rel="noopener">Location 2047&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we’re in the habit of seeing only the negative in ourselves and missing the positive, we can experiment with turning our attention to the goodness within us. If we’re in the habit of ignoring the humanity of strangers or people we don’t know well, we can experiment with being open and aware, taking an interest, connecting. If we’re in the habit of not really listening while conversing, we can experiment with being more fully present with the next person we speak to. If we’re in the habit of classifying and dismissing people based on what we think we know about them, we can experiment with listening with fresh ears, giving our full attention. If we’re wholehearted, open, interested, we may find that people surprise us. (

&lt;li>Remember that we don’t meditate to get better at meditating; we meditate to get better at life. (

&lt;li>meditation is essentially training our attention so that we can be more aware—not only of our own inner workings but also of what’s happening around us in the here and now. Once we see clearly what’s going on in the moment, we can then choose whether and how to act on what we’re seeing. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=260" rel="noopener">Location 260&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>whatever gets our attention flourishes, so if we lavish attention on the negative and inconsequential, they can overwhelm the positive and the meaningful. But if we do the opposite, refusing to deal with or acknowledge what’s difficult and painful, pretending it doesn’t exist, then our world is out of whack. Whatever doesn’t get our attention withers—or retreats below conscious awareness, where it may still affect our lives. In a perverse way, ignoring the painful and the difficult is just another way of feeding the wolf. Meditation teaches us to open our attention to all of human experience and all parts of ourselves. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=282" rel="noopener">Location 282&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the feeling of having your attention fractured by job and family, the enticement of electronic diversions, or the chatter of your mind—that morning’s spat with your mate replaying in your head, a litany of worries about the future or regrets about the past, a nervous endless-loop recitation of the day’s to-do list. Parts of that mental soundtrack may be old tapes that were instilled in childhood and have been playing so long we’ve nearly tuned them out of conscious awareness. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=287" rel="noopener">Location 287&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation teaches us to focus and to pay clear attention to our experiences and responses as they arise, and to observe them without judging them. That allows us to detect harmful habits of mind that were previously invisible to us. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=300" rel="noopener">Location 300&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All forms of meditation strengthen and direct our attention through the cultivation of three key skills—concentration, mindfulness, and compassion or lovingkindness. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=306" rel="noopener">Location 306&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The practice entails paying attention to each in-and-out breath, and when your mind wanders (it will, that’s natural), noticing whatever has captured your attention, then letting go of the thought or feeling without berating yourself for it. You then return to focusing on your breathing. In this way meditation trains us to stay in the moment before us instead of reliving the past or worrying about the future. And it teaches us how to be gentle with ourselves and others, to forgive our lapses and move (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=310" rel="noopener">Location 310&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But if we apply mindfulness to the experience of anger, we can safely draw close to the emotion instead of fleeing, and investigate it instead of stonewalling. We notice it without judging it. We can gather more information about what happens when we get mad—what sets off the anger, where it lodges in the body, and what else it also contains, like sadness, fear, or regret. This pause for nonjudgmental acknowledgment creates a bit of peaceful space within which we can make new, different choices about how to respond to something like anger. (

&lt;li>Mindfulness helps us get better at seeing the difference between what’s happening and the stories we tell ourselves about what’s happening, stories that get in the way of direct experience. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=331" rel="noopener">Location 331&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you meditate regularly, you also get certain results. I’ve already mentioned some of them, including greater calm, and improved concentration and more connection to others. (

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll begin to spot the unexamined assumptions that get in the way of happiness. These assumptions we make about who we are and the way the world works—what we deserve, how much we can handle, where happiness is to be found, whether or not positive change is possible—all greatly influence how and to what we pay attention. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=398" rel="noopener">Location 398&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Assumptions block direct experience and prevent us from gathering information that could bring us comfort and relief, or information that, though saddening and painful, will allow us to make better decisions. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=406" rel="noopener">Location 406&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll stop limiting yourself. When we practice meditation, we often begin to recognize a specific sort of conditioned response—previously undetected restrictions we’ve imposed on our lives. We spot the ways we sabotage our own growth and success because we’ve been conditioned to be content with meager results. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=414" rel="noopener">Location 414&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll weather hard times better. Meditation teaches us safe ways to open ourselves to the full range of experience—painful, pleasurable, and neutral—so we can learn how to be a friend to ourselves in good times and bad. During meditation sessions we practice being with difficult emotions and thoughts, even frightening or intense ones, in an open and accepting way, without adding self-criticism to something that already hurts. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=421" rel="noopener">Location 421&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll rediscover a deeper sense of what’s really important to you. Once you look beneath distractions and conditioned reactions, you’ll have a clearer view of your deepest, most enduring dreams, goals, and values. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=429" rel="noopener">Location 429&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll have a portable emergency resource. Meditation is the ultimate mobile device; you can use it anywhere, anytime, unobtrusively. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=431" rel="noopener">Location 431&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll be in closer touch with the best parts of yourself. Meditation practice cultivates qualities such as kindness, trust, and wisdom that you may think are missing from your makeup but are actually just undeveloped or obscured by stress and distractions. You’ll have the chance to access these qualities more easily and frequently. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=435" rel="noopener">Location 435&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll recapture the energy you’ve been wasting trying to control the uncontrollable. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=438" rel="noopener">Location 438&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Though we can affect our physical and emotional experiences, we can’t ultimately determine them; we can’t decree what emotions will arise within us. But we can learn through meditation to change our responses to them. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=447" rel="noopener">Location 447&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recognizing what we can’t control (the feelings that arise within us; other people; the weather) helps us have healthier boundaries at work and at home—no more trying to reform everyone all the time. It helps us to stop beating up on ourselves for having perfectly human emotions. It frees energy we expend on trying to control the uncontrollable. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=449" rel="noopener">Location 449&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll understand how to relate to change better—to accept that it’s inevitable and believe that it’s possible. Most of us have a mixed, often paradoxical attitude toward change. Some of us don’t think change is possible at all; we believe we’re stuck forever doing things the way we’ve always done them. Some of us simultaneously hope for change and fear it. We want to believe that change is possible, because that means that our lives can get better. But we also have trouble accepting change, because we want to hold on permanently to what’s pleasurable and positive. We’d like difficulties to be fleeting and comfort to stick around. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=452" rel="noopener">Location 452&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everything is impermanent: happiness, sorrow, a great meal, a powerful empire, what we’re feeling, the people around us, ourselves. Meditation helps us comprehend this fact—perhaps the basic truth of human existence, and the one we humans are most likely to balk at or be oblivious to, especially when it comes to the biggest change of all: Mortality happens, whether we like it or not. We grow old and die. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=458" rel="noopener">Location 458&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Following our breath while observing how thoughts continually ebb and flow can help us realize that all elements of our experience are in constant flux. During a meditation session, you’ll find it’s natural to go through many ups and downs, to encounter both new delights and newly awakened conflicts that have bubbled up from the unconscious mind. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=464" rel="noopener">Location 464&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We can’t control what thoughts and emotions arise within us, nor can we control the universal truth that everything changes. But we can learn to step back and rest in the awareness of what’s happening. That awareness can be our refuge. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=475" rel="noopener">Location 475&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“I’ve been through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened,” Mark Twain once said. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=601" rel="noopener">Location 601&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation—training our attention—allows us to find an essential cohesiveness. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=637" rel="noopener">Location 637&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thoughts and feelings will inevitably arise and claim your attention, but you’ll practice repeatedly noticing and letting go of these distractions, then returning your awareness to the in and out of your breath. Breathing, discovering you’ve been distracted, and starting over: simple and manageable. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=694" rel="noopener">Location 694&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some of these thoughts and feelings may be fascinating and delightful; some may make you uncomfortable; some may be deadly dull. You’ll practice letting them all go, without taking the time to judge them. This is a crucial first step in learning how to be more centered and present. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=696" rel="noopener">Location 696&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everyone who meditates, beginners and longer-term practitioners alike, gets hijacked at times by thoughts and feelings; it’s impossible not to be. But once you see how doable it is to start over, you won’t judge your efforts so harshly. And you’ll learn that starting over and not fruitlessly berating yourself are skills you can bring into your everyday life when you’ve made a mistake or lost sight of your aspirations. You can begin again. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=700" rel="noopener">Location 700&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This act of beginning again is the essential art of the meditation practice. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=778" rel="noopener">Location 778&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you have to let go of distractions and begin again thousands of times, fine. That’s not a roadblock to the practice—that is the practice. That’s life: starting over, one breath at a time. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=790" rel="noopener">Location 790&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Try to bring some of the qualities of concentration you just experienced—presence, calm observation, willingness to start over, and gentleness—to the next activity that you perform at home, at work, among friends, or among strangers. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=797" rel="noopener">Location 797&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>success in meditation is measured not in terms of what is happening to us but by how we relate to what is happening. Do you calmly observe your sleepiness, anxiety, or distraction? Success. Do you try to stop punishing yourself for feeling these things? Success. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=899" rel="noopener">Location 899&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not paying attention keeps us in an endless cycle of wanting. We move on to the next thing because we aren’t really taking in what we already have; inattention creates an escalating need for stimulation. When we’re keenly aware of what’s happening, we don’t need to grasp for the next great moment of sensation or taste or sound (all the while missing what’s actually here, right in front of us). Nor do we need to postpone our feeling of happiness until a more exciting or more pleasing object comes along, (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=907" rel="noopener">Location 907&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>His life is a pursuit of a pursuit forever. It is the future that creates his present. All is an interminable chain of longing. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=915" rel="noopener">Location 915&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Imagine eating an apple. If you do so paying very little attention to the sight of it, the feel, the smell and the taste, then eating the apple isn’t likely to be a fulfilling experience. Becoming aware of a mild discontent, you’re likely to blame the apple for being boring and commonplace. It’s easy to miss the fact that the quality of your attention played a major role in your dissatisfaction. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=920" rel="noopener">Location 920&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Learning to deepen our concentration allows us to look at the world with quiet eyes. We don’t need to reach out and grab ever more exotic or forbidden fruit. We develop calm and tranquility—and the calmer we get, the more at home we feel with our body and mind, with life as it is. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=938" rel="noopener">Location 938&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The point of meditation is not to annihilate thoughts; obviously there are plenty of times in life when thinking is called for—vital, in fact, to our survival. What we hope to learn is the difference between thinking and being lost in thought. We don’t want to stop our thoughts but to change our relationship with them—to be more present and aware when we’re thinking. If we’re aware of what we’re thinking, if we see clearly what’s going on in our minds, then we can choose whether and how to act on our thoughts. (

&lt;li>Thoughts moving through your mind are like clouds moving across the sky. They are not the sky, and the sky remains unchanged by them. The way to be with them is just to watch them go by. That’s not generally how we experience our thoughts, but that’s what you’re working toward. (

&lt;li>Meditation is a microcosm, a model, and a mirror. The skills we practice when we sit are transferable to the rest of our lives. In Week One we used the tool of concentration to steady and focus the mind. Following the breath, we became aware of thoughts, feelings, and sensations. We noted them and let them go without getting swept away by them, without dodging them or ignoring them (as we might normally have done in our busy daily lives), and without berating ourselves for having them. (

&lt;li>DEVELOPING OUR CONCENTRATION helps us steady our attention. The next skill we’ll develop, mindfulness, helps us to free our attention from burdens we may not even know we’re hauling around. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1122" rel="noopener">Location 1122&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How many times has an attempt to dodge pain made us miss the sweet parts of bittersweet—the chance to grow in response to a challenge, to help others or accept help from others? How many pleasures escape our notice because we think we need big, dramatic sensations to feel alive? Mindfulness can allow us to experience fully the moment in front of us—what Thoreau calls “the bloom of the present”—and to wake up from neutral so we don’t miss the small, rich moments that add up to a dimensional life. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1401" rel="noopener">Location 1401&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mindfulness isn’t difficult; we just need to remember to do it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1466" rel="noopener">Location 1466&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Often people think, I don’t have the right kind of mindfulness, the right level of concentration. Progress is not about levels; it’s about frequency. If we can remember to be mindful, if we can add more moments of mindfulness, that makes all the difference. Countless times a day we lose mindfulness and become lost in reaction or disconnected from what is happening. But the moment we recognize that we’ve lost mindfulness, we have already regained it; that recognition is its essence. We can begin again. (

&lt;li>I’VE HEARD SOME WONDERFUL EXPLANATIONS of mindfulness. Sylvia Boorstein, a writer and teacher, calls it “awake attention to what is happening inside and outside so we can respond from a place of wisdom.” The Vietnamese Zen teacher and poet Thich Nhat Hanh says, “I like to define mindfulness as the energy that helps us to be there one hundred percent; the energy of our true presence.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1479" rel="noopener">Location 1479&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>core group of unhealthy human tendencies that are obstacles to happiness. They’re the states of mind that distract us in meditation practice, and trip us up in the rest of our lives. Broadly speaking, they are: desire, aversion, sloth, restlessness, and doubt. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1551" rel="noopener">Location 1551&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You may recognize that the thoughts and emotions that come up in this week’s meditations are part of recurring patterns—that you’re hearing a lot of what I call old tapes, the familiar, habitual mental soundtrack I mentioned in the introduction. It’s helpful to acknowledge these tapes of ours, perhaps even to good-naturedly name them: Oh, (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1752" rel="noopener">Location 1752&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>During the meditation about a difficult situation, as I pictured that day, I realized how familiar that ‘one false move and I’m doomed’ feeling is. I don’t know yet why I play that tape—but at least now I know it happens.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1765" rel="noopener">Location 1765&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The fourth-century Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu told this story: There was a man so displeased by the sight of his own shadow and footsteps that he determined to get rid of both by running away from them. But every time he put down his foot, there was another step, and his shadow kept up with him without the slightest difficulty. He thought he must not be running fast enough. So he ran faster and faster and faster, without stopping, until he finally dropped dead of exhaustion. He failed to realize that if he merely stepped into the shade, his shadow would vanish, and if he sat down and stayed still, there would be no more footsteps. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1777" rel="noopener">Location 1777&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Practicing mindfulness meditation is making the choice to be still—to step into the quiet shade instead of running away from difficult thoughts and feelings. We sometimes call meditation non-doing. Instead of being swept away by our usual conditioned reactions, we’re quiet and watchful, fully present with what is, touching it deeply, being touched by it, and seeing what is happening in the simplest and most direct fashion possible. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1782" rel="noopener">Location 1782&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And being mindful of the moment doesn’t mean that we give up savoring memories or setting goals. I like to quote Thich Nhat Hanh: “To dwell in the here and now does not mean you never think about the past or responsibly plan for the future,” he says. “The idea is simply not to allow yourself to get lost in regrets about the past or worries about the future. If you are firmly grounded in the present moment, the past can be an object of inquiry, the object of your mindfulness and concentration. You can attain many insights by looking into the past. But you are still grounded in the present moment.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1880" rel="noopener">Location 1880&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we know our thoughts, we neither dodge them nor get lost in them. Instead, we can decide when and if we should act on them; we can better discern which actions will lead to happiness and which to suffering. Meditation allows us to see and accept ourselves as we are in the moment—sometimes hot-tempered and sometimes mellow, sometimes cowardly and sometimes strong, sometimes ashamed and sometimes proud, sometimes confused and sometimes clear. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1947" rel="noopener">Location 1947&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The customary phrases are usually variations on May I Be Safe (or May I Be Free from Danger), May I Be Happy, May I Be Healthy, May I Live with Ease—may daily life not be a struggle. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=2047" rel="noopener">Location 2047&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we’re in the habit of seeing only the negative in ourselves and missing the positive, we can experiment with turning our attention to the goodness within us. If we’re in the habit of ignoring the humanity of strangers or people we don’t know well, we can experiment with being open and aware, taking an interest, connecting. If we’re in the habit of not really listening while conversing, we can experiment with being more fully present with the next person we speak to. If we’re in the habit of classifying and dismissing people based on what we think we know about them, we can experiment with listening with fresh ears, giving our full attention. If we’re wholehearted, open, interested, we may find that people surprise us. (

&lt;li>Remember that we don’t meditate to get better at meditating; we meditate to get better at life. (

&lt;li>meditation is essentially training our attention so that we can be more aware—not only of our own inner workings but also of what’s happening around us in the here and now. Once we see clearly what’s going on in the moment, we can then choose whether and how to act on what we’re seeing. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=260" rel="noopener">Location 260&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>whatever gets our attention flourishes, so if we lavish attention on the negative and inconsequential, they can overwhelm the positive and the meaningful. But if we do the opposite, refusing to deal with or acknowledge what’s difficult and painful, pretending it doesn’t exist, then our world is out of whack. Whatever doesn’t get our attention withers—or retreats below conscious awareness, where it may still affect our lives. In a perverse way, ignoring the painful and the difficult is just another way of feeding the wolf. Meditation teaches us to open our attention to all of human experience and all parts of ourselves. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=282" rel="noopener">Location 282&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the feeling of having your attention fractured by job and family, the enticement of electronic diversions, or the chatter of your mind—that morning’s spat with your mate replaying in your head, a litany of worries about the future or regrets about the past, a nervous endless-loop recitation of the day’s to-do list. Parts of that mental soundtrack may be old tapes that were instilled in childhood and have been playing so long we’ve nearly tuned them out of conscious awareness. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=287" rel="noopener">Location 287&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation teaches us to focus and to pay clear attention to our experiences and responses as they arise, and to observe them without judging them. That allows us to detect harmful habits of mind that were previously invisible to us. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=300" rel="noopener">Location 300&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All forms of meditation strengthen and direct our attention through the cultivation of three key skills—concentration, mindfulness, and compassion or lovingkindness. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=306" rel="noopener">Location 306&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The practice entails paying attention to each in-and-out breath, and when your mind wanders (it will, that’s natural), noticing whatever has captured your attention, then letting go of the thought or feeling without berating yourself for it. You then return to focusing on your breathing. In this way meditation trains us to stay in the moment before us instead of reliving the past or worrying about the future. And it teaches us how to be gentle with ourselves and others, to forgive our lapses and move (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=310" rel="noopener">Location 310&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But if we apply mindfulness to the experience of anger, we can safely draw close to the emotion instead of fleeing, and investigate it instead of stonewalling. We notice it without judging it. We can gather more information about what happens when we get mad—what sets off the anger, where it lodges in the body, and what else it also contains, like sadness, fear, or regret. This pause for nonjudgmental acknowledgment creates a bit of peaceful space within which we can make new, different choices about how to respond to something like anger. (

&lt;li>Mindfulness helps us get better at seeing the difference between what’s happening and the stories we tell ourselves about what’s happening, stories that get in the way of direct experience. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=331" rel="noopener">Location 331&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you meditate regularly, you also get certain results. I’ve already mentioned some of them, including greater calm, and improved concentration and more connection to others. (

&lt;li>You’ll begin to spot the unexamined assumptions that get in the way of happiness. These assumptions we make about who we are and the way the world works—what we deserve, how much we can handle, where happiness is to be found, whether or not positive change is possible—all greatly influence how and to what we pay attention. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=398" rel="noopener">Location 398&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Assumptions block direct experience and prevent us from gathering information that could bring us comfort and relief, or information that, though saddening and painful, will allow us to make better decisions. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=406" rel="noopener">Location 406&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll stop limiting yourself. When we practice meditation, we often begin to recognize a specific sort of conditioned response—previously undetected restrictions we’ve imposed on our lives. We spot the ways we sabotage our own growth and success because we’ve been conditioned to be content with meager results. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=414" rel="noopener">Location 414&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll weather hard times better. Meditation teaches us safe ways to open ourselves to the full range of experience—painful, pleasurable, and neutral—so we can learn how to be a friend to ourselves in good times and bad. During meditation sessions we practice being with difficult emotions and thoughts, even frightening or intense ones, in an open and accepting way, without adding self-criticism to something that already hurts. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=421" rel="noopener">Location 421&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll rediscover a deeper sense of what’s really important to you. Once you look beneath distractions and conditioned reactions, you’ll have a clearer view of your deepest, most enduring dreams, goals, and values. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=429" rel="noopener">Location 429&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll have a portable emergency resource. Meditation is the ultimate mobile device; you can use it anywhere, anytime, unobtrusively. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=431" rel="noopener">Location 431&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll be in closer touch with the best parts of yourself. Meditation practice cultivates qualities such as kindness, trust, and wisdom that you may think are missing from your makeup but are actually just undeveloped or obscured by stress and distractions. You’ll have the chance to access these qualities more easily and frequently. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=435" rel="noopener">Location 435&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll recapture the energy you’ve been wasting trying to control the uncontrollable. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=438" rel="noopener">Location 438&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Though we can affect our physical and emotional experiences, we can’t ultimately determine them; we can’t decree what emotions will arise within us. But we can learn through meditation to change our responses to them. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=447" rel="noopener">Location 447&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recognizing what we can’t control (the feelings that arise within us; other people; the weather) helps us have healthier boundaries at work and at home—no more trying to reform everyone all the time. It helps us to stop beating up on ourselves for having perfectly human emotions. It frees energy we expend on trying to control the uncontrollable. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=449" rel="noopener">Location 449&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll understand how to relate to change better—to accept that it’s inevitable and believe that it’s possible. Most of us have a mixed, often paradoxical attitude toward change. Some of us don’t think change is possible at all; we believe we’re stuck forever doing things the way we’ve always done them. Some of us simultaneously hope for change and fear it. We want to believe that change is possible, because that means that our lives can get better. But we also have trouble accepting change, because we want to hold on permanently to what’s pleasurable and positive. We’d like difficulties to be fleeting and comfort to stick around. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=452" rel="noopener">Location 452&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everything is impermanent: happiness, sorrow, a great meal, a powerful empire, what we’re feeling, the people around us, ourselves. Meditation helps us comprehend this fact—perhaps the basic truth of human existence, and the one we humans are most likely to balk at or be oblivious to, especially when it comes to the biggest change of all: Mortality happens, whether we like it or not. We grow old and die. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=458" rel="noopener">Location 458&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Following our breath while observing how thoughts continually ebb and flow can help us realize that all elements of our experience are in constant flux. During a meditation session, you’ll find it’s natural to go through many ups and downs, to encounter both new delights and newly awakened conflicts that have bubbled up from the unconscious mind. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=464" rel="noopener">Location 464&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We can’t control what thoughts and emotions arise within us, nor can we control the universal truth that everything changes. But we can learn to step back and rest in the awareness of what’s happening. That awareness can be our refuge. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=475" rel="noopener">Location 475&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“I’ve been through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened,” Mark Twain once said. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=601" rel="noopener">Location 601&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation—training our attention—allows us to find an essential cohesiveness. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=637" rel="noopener">Location 637&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thoughts and feelings will inevitably arise and claim your attention, but you’ll practice repeatedly noticing and letting go of these distractions, then returning your awareness to the in and out of your breath. Breathing, discovering you’ve been distracted, and starting over: simple and manageable. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=694" rel="noopener">Location 694&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some of these thoughts and feelings may be fascinating and delightful; some may make you uncomfortable; some may be deadly dull. You’ll practice letting them all go, without taking the time to judge them. This is a crucial first step in learning how to be more centered and present. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=696" rel="noopener">Location 696&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everyone who meditates, beginners and longer-term practitioners alike, gets hijacked at times by thoughts and feelings; it’s impossible not to be. But once you see how doable it is to start over, you won’t judge your efforts so harshly. And you’ll learn that starting over and not fruitlessly berating yourself are skills you can bring into your everyday life when you’ve made a mistake or lost sight of your aspirations. You can begin again. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=700" rel="noopener">Location 700&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This act of beginning again is the essential art of the meditation practice. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=778" rel="noopener">Location 778&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you have to let go of distractions and begin again thousands of times, fine. That’s not a roadblock to the practice—that is the practice. That’s life: starting over, one breath at a time. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=790" rel="noopener">Location 790&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Try to bring some of the qualities of concentration you just experienced—presence, calm observation, willingness to start over, and gentleness—to the next activity that you perform at home, at work, among friends, or among strangers. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=797" rel="noopener">Location 797&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>success in meditation is measured not in terms of what is happening to us but by how we relate to what is happening. Do you calmly observe your sleepiness, anxiety, or distraction? Success. Do you try to stop punishing yourself for feeling these things? Success. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=899" rel="noopener">Location 899&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not paying attention keeps us in an endless cycle of wanting. We move on to the next thing because we aren’t really taking in what we already have; inattention creates an escalating need for stimulation. When we’re keenly aware of what’s happening, we don’t need to grasp for the next great moment of sensation or taste or sound (all the while missing what’s actually here, right in front of us). Nor do we need to postpone our feeling of happiness until a more exciting or more pleasing object comes along, (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=907" rel="noopener">Location 907&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>His life is a pursuit of a pursuit forever. It is the future that creates his present. All is an interminable chain of longing. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=915" rel="noopener">Location 915&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Imagine eating an apple. If you do so paying very little attention to the sight of it, the feel, the smell and the taste, then eating the apple isn’t likely to be a fulfilling experience. Becoming aware of a mild discontent, you’re likely to blame the apple for being boring and commonplace. It’s easy to miss the fact that the quality of your attention played a major role in your dissatisfaction. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=920" rel="noopener">Location 920&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Learning to deepen our concentration allows us to look at the world with quiet eyes. We don’t need to reach out and grab ever more exotic or forbidden fruit. We develop calm and tranquility—and the calmer we get, the more at home we feel with our body and mind, with life as it is. (

&lt;li>The point of meditation is not to annihilate thoughts; obviously there are plenty of times in life when thinking is called for—vital, in fact, to our survival. What we hope to learn is the difference between thinking and being lost in thought. We don’t want to stop our thoughts but to change our relationship with them—to be more present and aware when we’re thinking. If we’re aware of what we’re thinking, if we see clearly what’s going on in our minds, then we can choose whether and how to act on our thoughts. (

&lt;li>Thoughts moving through your mind are like clouds moving across the sky. They are not the sky, and the sky remains unchanged by them. The way to be with them is just to watch them go by. That’s not generally how we experience our thoughts, but that’s what you’re working toward. (

&lt;li>Meditation is a microcosm, a model, and a mirror. The skills we practice when we sit are transferable to the rest of our lives. In Week One we used the tool of concentration to steady and focus the mind. Following the breath, we became aware of thoughts, feelings, and sensations. We noted them and let them go without getting swept away by them, without dodging them or ignoring them (as we might normally have done in our busy daily lives), and without berating ourselves for having them. (

&lt;li>DEVELOPING OUR CONCENTRATION helps us steady our attention. The next skill we’ll develop, mindfulness, helps us to free our attention from burdens we may not even know we’re hauling around. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1122" rel="noopener">Location 1122&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How many times has an attempt to dodge pain made us miss the sweet parts of bittersweet—the chance to grow in response to a challenge, to help others or accept help from others? How many pleasures escape our notice because we think we need big, dramatic sensations to feel alive? Mindfulness can allow us to experience fully the moment in front of us—what Thoreau calls “the bloom of the present”—and to wake up from neutral so we don’t miss the small, rich moments that add up to a dimensional life. (

&lt;li>Mindfulness isn’t difficult; we just need to remember to do it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1466" rel="noopener">Location 1466&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Often people think, I don’t have the right kind of mindfulness, the right level of concentration. Progress is not about levels; it’s about frequency. If we can remember to be mindful, if we can add more moments of mindfulness, that makes all the difference. Countless times a day we lose mindfulness and become lost in reaction or disconnected from what is happening. But the moment we recognize that we’ve lost mindfulness, we have already regained it; that recognition is its essence. We can begin again. (

&lt;li>I’VE HEARD SOME WONDERFUL EXPLANATIONS of mindfulness. Sylvia Boorstein, a writer and teacher, calls it “awake attention to what is happening inside and outside so we can respond from a place of wisdom.” The Vietnamese Zen teacher and poet Thich Nhat Hanh says, “I like to define mindfulness as the energy that helps us to be there one hundred percent; the energy of our true presence.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1479" rel="noopener">Location 1479&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>core group of unhealthy human tendencies that are obstacles to happiness. They’re the states of mind that distract us in meditation practice, and trip us up in the rest of our lives. Broadly speaking, they are: desire, aversion, sloth, restlessness, and doubt. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1551" rel="noopener">Location 1551&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You may recognize that the thoughts and emotions that come up in this week’s meditations are part of recurring patterns—that you’re hearing a lot of what I call old tapes, the familiar, habitual mental soundtrack I mentioned in the introduction. It’s helpful to acknowledge these tapes of ours, perhaps even to good-naturedly name them: Oh, (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1752" rel="noopener">Location 1752&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>During the meditation about a difficult situation, as I pictured that day, I realized how familiar that ‘one false move and I’m doomed’ feeling is. I don’t know yet why I play that tape—but at least now I know it happens.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1765" rel="noopener">Location 1765&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The fourth-century Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu told this story: There was a man so displeased by the sight of his own shadow and footsteps that he determined to get rid of both by running away from them. But every time he put down his foot, there was another step, and his shadow kept up with him without the slightest difficulty. He thought he must not be running fast enough. So he ran faster and faster and faster, without stopping, until he finally dropped dead of exhaustion. He failed to realize that if he merely stepped into the shade, his shadow would vanish, and if he sat down and stayed still, there would be no more footsteps. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1777" rel="noopener">Location 1777&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Practicing mindfulness meditation is making the choice to be still—to step into the quiet shade instead of running away from difficult thoughts and feelings. We sometimes call meditation non-doing. Instead of being swept away by our usual conditioned reactions, we’re quiet and watchful, fully present with what is, touching it deeply, being touched by it, and seeing what is happening in the simplest and most direct fashion possible. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1782" rel="noopener">Location 1782&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And being mindful of the moment doesn’t mean that we give up savoring memories or setting goals. I like to quote Thich Nhat Hanh: “To dwell in the here and now does not mean you never think about the past or responsibly plan for the future,” he says. “The idea is simply not to allow yourself to get lost in regrets about the past or worries about the future. If you are firmly grounded in the present moment, the past can be an object of inquiry, the object of your mindfulness and concentration. You can attain many insights by looking into the past. But you are still grounded in the present moment.” (

&lt;li>When we know our thoughts, we neither dodge them nor get lost in them. Instead, we can decide when and if we should act on them; we can better discern which actions will lead to happiness and which to suffering. Meditation allows us to see and accept ourselves as we are in the moment—sometimes hot-tempered and sometimes mellow, sometimes cowardly and sometimes strong, sometimes ashamed and sometimes proud, sometimes confused and sometimes clear. (

&lt;li>The customary phrases are usually variations on May I Be Safe (or May I Be Free from Danger), May I Be Happy, May I Be Healthy, May I Live with Ease—may daily life not be a struggle. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=2047" rel="noopener">Location 2047&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we’re in the habit of seeing only the negative in ourselves and missing the positive, we can experiment with turning our attention to the goodness within us. If we’re in the habit of ignoring the humanity of strangers or people we don’t know well, we can experiment with being open and aware, taking an interest, connecting. If we’re in the habit of not really listening while conversing, we can experiment with being more fully present with the next person we speak to. If we’re in the habit of classifying and dismissing people based on what we think we know about them, we can experiment with listening with fresh ears, giving our full attention. If we’re wholehearted, open, interested, we may find that people surprise us. (

&lt;li>Remember that we don’t meditate to get better at meditating; we meditate to get better at life. (

&lt;li>meditation is essentially training our attention so that we can be more aware—not only of our own inner workings but also of what’s happening around us in the here and now. Once we see clearly what’s going on in the moment, we can then choose whether and how to act on what we’re seeing. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=260" rel="noopener">Location 260&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>whatever gets our attention flourishes, so if we lavish attention on the negative and inconsequential, they can overwhelm the positive and the meaningful. But if we do the opposite, refusing to deal with or acknowledge what’s difficult and painful, pretending it doesn’t exist, then our world is out of whack. Whatever doesn’t get our attention withers—or retreats below conscious awareness, where it may still affect our lives. In a perverse way, ignoring the painful and the difficult is just another way of feeding the wolf. Meditation teaches us to open our attention to all of human experience and all parts of ourselves. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=282" rel="noopener">Location 282&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the feeling of having your attention fractured by job and family, the enticement of electronic diversions, or the chatter of your mind—that morning’s spat with your mate replaying in your head, a litany of worries about the future or regrets about the past, a nervous endless-loop recitation of the day’s to-do list. Parts of that mental soundtrack may be old tapes that were instilled in childhood and have been playing so long we’ve nearly tuned them out of conscious awareness. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=287" rel="noopener">Location 287&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation teaches us to focus and to pay clear attention to our experiences and responses as they arise, and to observe them without judging them. That allows us to detect harmful habits of mind that were previously invisible to us. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=300" rel="noopener">Location 300&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All forms of meditation strengthen and direct our attention through the cultivation of three key skills—concentration, mindfulness, and compassion or lovingkindness. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=306" rel="noopener">Location 306&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The practice entails paying attention to each in-and-out breath, and when your mind wanders (it will, that’s natural), noticing whatever has captured your attention, then letting go of the thought or feeling without berating yourself for it. You then return to focusing on your breathing. In this way meditation trains us to stay in the moment before us instead of reliving the past or worrying about the future. And it teaches us how to be gentle with ourselves and others, to forgive our lapses and move (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=310" rel="noopener">Location 310&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But if we apply mindfulness to the experience of anger, we can safely draw close to the emotion instead of fleeing, and investigate it instead of stonewalling. We notice it without judging it. We can gather more information about what happens when we get mad—what sets off the anger, where it lodges in the body, and what else it also contains, like sadness, fear, or regret. This pause for nonjudgmental acknowledgment creates a bit of peaceful space within which we can make new, different choices about how to respond to something like anger. (

&lt;li>Mindfulness helps us get better at seeing the difference between what’s happening and the stories we tell ourselves about what’s happening, stories that get in the way of direct experience. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=331" rel="noopener">Location 331&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you meditate regularly, you also get certain results. I’ve already mentioned some of them, including greater calm, and improved concentration and more connection to others. (

&lt;li>You’ll begin to spot the unexamined assumptions that get in the way of happiness. These assumptions we make about who we are and the way the world works—what we deserve, how much we can handle, where happiness is to be found, whether or not positive change is possible—all greatly influence how and to what we pay attention. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=398" rel="noopener">Location 398&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Assumptions block direct experience and prevent us from gathering information that could bring us comfort and relief, or information that, though saddening and painful, will allow us to make better decisions. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=406" rel="noopener">Location 406&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll stop limiting yourself. When we practice meditation, we often begin to recognize a specific sort of conditioned response—previously undetected restrictions we’ve imposed on our lives. We spot the ways we sabotage our own growth and success because we’ve been conditioned to be content with meager results. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=414" rel="noopener">Location 414&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll weather hard times better. Meditation teaches us safe ways to open ourselves to the full range of experience—painful, pleasurable, and neutral—so we can learn how to be a friend to ourselves in good times and bad. During meditation sessions we practice being with difficult emotions and thoughts, even frightening or intense ones, in an open and accepting way, without adding self-criticism to something that already hurts. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=421" rel="noopener">Location 421&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll rediscover a deeper sense of what’s really important to you. Once you look beneath distractions and conditioned reactions, you’ll have a clearer view of your deepest, most enduring dreams, goals, and values. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=429" rel="noopener">Location 429&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll have a portable emergency resource. Meditation is the ultimate mobile device; you can use it anywhere, anytime, unobtrusively. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=431" rel="noopener">Location 431&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll be in closer touch with the best parts of yourself. Meditation practice cultivates qualities such as kindness, trust, and wisdom that you may think are missing from your makeup but are actually just undeveloped or obscured by stress and distractions. You’ll have the chance to access these qualities more easily and frequently. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=435" rel="noopener">Location 435&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll recapture the energy you’ve been wasting trying to control the uncontrollable. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=438" rel="noopener">Location 438&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Though we can affect our physical and emotional experiences, we can’t ultimately determine them; we can’t decree what emotions will arise within us. But we can learn through meditation to change our responses to them. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=447" rel="noopener">Location 447&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recognizing what we can’t control (the feelings that arise within us; other people; the weather) helps us have healthier boundaries at work and at home—no more trying to reform everyone all the time. It helps us to stop beating up on ourselves for having perfectly human emotions. It frees energy we expend on trying to control the uncontrollable. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=449" rel="noopener">Location 449&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ll understand how to relate to change better—to accept that it’s inevitable and believe that it’s possible. Most of us have a mixed, often paradoxical attitude toward change. Some of us don’t think change is possible at all; we believe we’re stuck forever doing things the way we’ve always done them. Some of us simultaneously hope for change and fear it. We want to believe that change is possible, because that means that our lives can get better. But we also have trouble accepting change, because we want to hold on permanently to what’s pleasurable and positive. We’d like difficulties to be fleeting and comfort to stick around. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=452" rel="noopener">Location 452&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everything is impermanent: happiness, sorrow, a great meal, a powerful empire, what we’re feeling, the people around us, ourselves. Meditation helps us comprehend this fact—perhaps the basic truth of human existence, and the one we humans are most likely to balk at or be oblivious to, especially when it comes to the biggest change of all: Mortality happens, whether we like it or not. We grow old and die. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=458" rel="noopener">Location 458&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Following our breath while observing how thoughts continually ebb and flow can help us realize that all elements of our experience are in constant flux. During a meditation session, you’ll find it’s natural to go through many ups and downs, to encounter both new delights and newly awakened conflicts that have bubbled up from the unconscious mind. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=464" rel="noopener">Location 464&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We can’t control what thoughts and emotions arise within us, nor can we control the universal truth that everything changes. But we can learn to step back and rest in the awareness of what’s happening. That awareness can be our refuge. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=475" rel="noopener">Location 475&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“I’ve been through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened,” Mark Twain once said. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=601" rel="noopener">Location 601&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation—training our attention—allows us to find an essential cohesiveness. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=637" rel="noopener">Location 637&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thoughts and feelings will inevitably arise and claim your attention, but you’ll practice repeatedly noticing and letting go of these distractions, then returning your awareness to the in and out of your breath. Breathing, discovering you’ve been distracted, and starting over: simple and manageable. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=694" rel="noopener">Location 694&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some of these thoughts and feelings may be fascinating and delightful; some may make you uncomfortable; some may be deadly dull. You’ll practice letting them all go, without taking the time to judge them. This is a crucial first step in learning how to be more centered and present. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=696" rel="noopener">Location 696&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everyone who meditates, beginners and longer-term practitioners alike, gets hijacked at times by thoughts and feelings; it’s impossible not to be. But once you see how doable it is to start over, you won’t judge your efforts so harshly. And you’ll learn that starting over and not fruitlessly berating yourself are skills you can bring into your everyday life when you’ve made a mistake or lost sight of your aspirations. You can begin again. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=700" rel="noopener">Location 700&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This act of beginning again is the essential art of the meditation practice. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=778" rel="noopener">Location 778&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you have to let go of distractions and begin again thousands of times, fine. That’s not a roadblock to the practice—that is the practice. That’s life: starting over, one breath at a time. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=790" rel="noopener">Location 790&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Try to bring some of the qualities of concentration you just experienced—presence, calm observation, willingness to start over, and gentleness—to the next activity that you perform at home, at work, among friends, or among strangers. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=797" rel="noopener">Location 797&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>success in meditation is measured not in terms of what is happening to us but by how we relate to what is happening. Do you calmly observe your sleepiness, anxiety, or distraction? Success. Do you try to stop punishing yourself for feeling these things? Success. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=899" rel="noopener">Location 899&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not paying attention keeps us in an endless cycle of wanting. We move on to the next thing because we aren’t really taking in what we already have; inattention creates an escalating need for stimulation. When we’re keenly aware of what’s happening, we don’t need to grasp for the next great moment of sensation or taste or sound (all the while missing what’s actually here, right in front of us). Nor do we need to postpone our feeling of happiness until a more exciting or more pleasing object comes along, (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=907" rel="noopener">Location 907&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>His life is a pursuit of a pursuit forever. It is the future that creates his present. All is an interminable chain of longing. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=915" rel="noopener">Location 915&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Imagine eating an apple. If you do so paying very little attention to the sight of it, the feel, the smell and the taste, then eating the apple isn’t likely to be a fulfilling experience. Becoming aware of a mild discontent, you’re likely to blame the apple for being boring and commonplace. It’s easy to miss the fact that the quality of your attention played a major role in your dissatisfaction. (

&lt;li>Learning to deepen our concentration allows us to look at the world with quiet eyes. We don’t need to reach out and grab ever more exotic or forbidden fruit. We develop calm and tranquility—and the calmer we get, the more at home we feel with our body and mind, with life as it is. (

&lt;li>The point of meditation is not to annihilate thoughts; obviously there are plenty of times in life when thinking is called for—vital, in fact, to our survival. What we hope to learn is the difference between thinking and being lost in thought. We don’t want to stop our thoughts but to change our relationship with them—to be more present and aware when we’re thinking. If we’re aware of what we’re thinking, if we see clearly what’s going on in our minds, then we can choose whether and how to act on our thoughts. (

&lt;li>Thoughts moving through your mind are like clouds moving across the sky. They are not the sky, and the sky remains unchanged by them. The way to be with them is just to watch them go by. That’s not generally how we experience our thoughts, but that’s what you’re working toward. (

&lt;li>Meditation is a microcosm, a model, and a mirror. The skills we practice when we sit are transferable to the rest of our lives. In Week One we used the tool of concentration to steady and focus the mind. Following the breath, we became aware of thoughts, feelings, and sensations. We noted them and let them go without getting swept away by them, without dodging them or ignoring them (as we might normally have done in our busy daily lives), and without berating ourselves for having them. (

&lt;li>DEVELOPING OUR CONCENTRATION helps us steady our attention. The next skill we’ll develop, mindfulness, helps us to free our attention from burdens we may not even know we’re hauling around. (

&lt;li>How many times has an attempt to dodge pain made us miss the sweet parts of bittersweet—the chance to grow in response to a challenge, to help others or accept help from others? How many pleasures escape our notice because we think we need big, dramatic sensations to feel alive? Mindfulness can allow us to experience fully the moment in front of us—what Thoreau calls “the bloom of the present”—and to wake up from neutral so we don’t miss the small, rich moments that add up to a dimensional life. (

&lt;li>Mindfulness isn’t difficult; we just need to remember to do it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1466" rel="noopener">Location 1466&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Often people think, I don’t have the right kind of mindfulness, the right level of concentration. Progress is not about levels; it’s about frequency. If we can remember to be mindful, if we can add more moments of mindfulness, that makes all the difference. Countless times a day we lose mindfulness and become lost in reaction or disconnected from what is happening. But the moment we recognize that we’ve lost mindfulness, we have already regained it; that recognition is its essence. We can begin again. (

&lt;li>I’VE HEARD SOME WONDERFUL EXPLANATIONS of mindfulness. Sylvia Boorstein, a writer and teacher, calls it “awake attention to what is happening inside and outside so we can respond from a place of wisdom.” The Vietnamese Zen teacher and poet Thich Nhat Hanh says, “I like to define mindfulness as the energy that helps us to be there one hundred percent; the energy of our true presence.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1479" rel="noopener">Location 1479&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>core group of unhealthy human tendencies that are obstacles to happiness. They’re the states of mind that distract us in meditation practice, and trip us up in the rest of our lives. Broadly speaking, they are: desire, aversion, sloth, restlessness, and doubt. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1551" rel="noopener">Location 1551&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You may recognize that the thoughts and emotions that come up in this week’s meditations are part of recurring patterns—that you’re hearing a lot of what I call old tapes, the familiar, habitual mental soundtrack I mentioned in the introduction. It’s helpful to acknowledge these tapes of ours, perhaps even to good-naturedly name them: Oh, (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1752" rel="noopener">Location 1752&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>During the meditation about a difficult situation, as I pictured that day, I realized how familiar that ‘one false move and I’m doomed’ feeling is. I don’t know yet why I play that tape—but at least now I know it happens.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1765" rel="noopener">Location 1765&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The fourth-century Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu told this story: There was a man so displeased by the sight of his own shadow and footsteps that he determined to get rid of both by running away from them. But every time he put down his foot, there was another step, and his shadow kept up with him without the slightest difficulty. He thought he must not be running fast enough. So he ran faster and faster and faster, without stopping, until he finally dropped dead of exhaustion. He failed to realize that if he merely stepped into the shade, his shadow would vanish, and if he sat down and stayed still, there would be no more footsteps. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1777" rel="noopener">Location 1777&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Practicing mindfulness meditation is making the choice to be still—to step into the quiet shade instead of running away from difficult thoughts and feelings. We sometimes call meditation non-doing. Instead of being swept away by our usual conditioned reactions, we’re quiet and watchful, fully present with what is, touching it deeply, being touched by it, and seeing what is happening in the simplest and most direct fashion possible. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004IARYIY&amp;amp;location=1782" rel="noopener">Location 1782&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And being mindful of the moment doesn’t mean that we give up savoring memories or setting goals. I like to quote Thich Nhat Hanh: “To dwell in the here and now does not mean you never think about the past or responsibly plan for the future,” he says. “The idea is simply not to allow yourself to get lost in regrets about the past or worries about the future. If you are firmly grounded in the present moment, the past can be an object of inquiry, the object of your mindfulness and concentration. You can attain many insights by looking into the past. But you are still grounded in the present moment.” (

&lt;li>When we know our thoughts, we neither dodge them nor get lost in them. Instead, we can decide when and if we should act on them; we can better discern which actions will lead to happiness and which to suffering. Meditation allows us to see and accept ourselves as we are in the moment—sometimes hot-tempered and sometimes mellow, sometimes cowardly and sometimes strong, sometimes ashamed and sometimes proud, sometimes confused and sometimes clear.

&lt;li>The customary phrases are usually variations on May I Be Safe (or May I Be Free from Danger), May I Be Happy, May I Be Healthy, May I Live with Ease—may daily life not be a struggle. (

&lt;li>If we’re in the habit of seeing only the negative in ourselves and missing the positive, we can experiment with turning our attention to the goodness within us. If we’re in the habit of ignoring the humanity of strangers or people we don’t know well, we can experiment with being open and aware, taking an interest, connecting. If we’re in the habit of not really listening while conversing, we can experiment with being more fully present with the next person we speak to. If we’re in the habit of classifying and dismissing people based on what we think we know about them, we can experiment with listening with fresh ears, giving our full attention. If we’re wholehearted, open, interested, we may find that people surprise us. (

&lt;li>Remember that we don’t meditate to get better at meditating; we meditate to get better at life. (

Q: What is the Data Product?
A: The Data Product is the collection of every piece of data, and the tools used to generate, access, and analyze that data, within an organization.
Q: How should a Data Team be funded?
A: A Data Team can be funded directly by the company or by the departments who are supported by the Data Team. Explaining the ROI to business partners can be a useful tool in securing funding.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Data teams aim to help the people in their organization make better decisions. Many data teams aren’t doing this as well as they could and are missing out on a huge opportunity, both for the organization and the team. This gap is due to teams not being set up for success, which undermines trust in the data and the insights the team generates (

&lt;li>Service-oriented data teams aren’t effective
Most data teams aren’t set up for success. For many years, data teams have been buried in the IT function. Like IT functions, those data teams handled getting data out of their systems and presenting them to the stakeholder as CSVs from which the stakeholders could work their magic and come up with conclusions (

&lt;li>Every internal tool or app that gives people the ability to generate, access, and analyze data is also a part of the Data Product. These can be thought of as “features” of the Data Product. A simple heuristic is this: if people are using it to make decisions, then it’s a feature of the Data Product (

Q: What is the Data Product?
A: The Data Product is the collection of every piece of data, and the tools used to generate, access, and analyze that data, within an organization.
Q: How should a Data Team be funded?
A: A Data Team can be funded directly by the company or by the departments who are supported by the Data Team. Explaining the ROI to business partners can be a useful tool in securing funding.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Data teams aim to help the people in their organization make better decisions.

Most data teams aren’t set up for success. For many years, data teams have been buried in the IT function.

&lt;li>user stories and other tactics should be deployed in such a way that you and your Data Team are focused on deeply understanding what your colleagues are trying to do.

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Stated values possess no magic for cultural transformation, but with a bit of care they can be useful for consolidating cultural change that you’ve already made. (

&lt;li>Stated values make it clear how you want people to make decisions. If senior team members live and role model the values, then those values will become an active, living artifact. If stated values don’t align, then they’ll become a frequently forgotten, running joke. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpz11mc14c3yca3c7njcyp8" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Documented values increase cohesion across the new and existing team. They also avoid the scenario where new hires unknowingly practice their previous companies’ values, causing a cultural rift between new and existing teams (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpz1qkmtyj8x3a17qz6a5s1" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>welcome ideas from across the team rather than only accepting top-down ideas, and you want to formalize that change so it persists over time (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpz27qnfgg3aypnnjmtn5es" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a few vocal engineers are advocating for teams setting their own patterns independently of the organization’s existing ones. Formalizing the reuse of existing approaches when possible will prevent a prolonged conflict (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpz305k0nm3391chyqkqmy7" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ve acquired a very small company of five engineers to join your existing organization of five hundred engineers. You’ve been clear in the acquisition process that you’re looking for the new team to merge into the existing organization, and your documented values help them navigate that change successfully (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpz3dz32eeazw3xdwhz9pp5" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adding an organization-appropriate interpretation to an existing value reinforces that company value, rather than detracting from it, and is an easy sell to the wider executive team. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpz5q4m5c15tbwd0pqzt55w" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It’s much more work to maintain values than to create them, and adding to the company values will allow you to share the maintenance across the executive team. If it’s not widely applicable, then you have the choice between adding either engineering organizational values or engineering leadership values. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpz7vd3cewc5w2cdpvv1238" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>people often have a strong internalized belief that a company should have one shared culture, you may find that introducing organization-specific values often run into a surprising amount of friction. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpz8qamhrf04ypf7548vw1h" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In practice, almost everyone aspires to be a leader, and will model their behavior on leaders within the team, so leadership values tend to establish themselves as organizational values while side-stepping some of the tripwires that come being explicit. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpzb69nxke79rgh8wxmp7cx" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A useful value is reversible, applicable, and honest (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpzenpc1687ne4a7s9ynrrm" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Effective values guide behavior, and it’s only practical to guide behavior when there are multiple, viable approaches. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpzfp56rvjz3excwn2p09kr" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many values are written down and forgotten. To keep a value alive and useful, it needs to be used frequently and visibly by the team. Applicability means a value that contributes to planning sessions, performance reviews, and hiring decisions. (

&lt;li>&lt;em>Seek feedback&lt;/em> clarifies the expectation that you should be actively seeking feedback on your work rather than working in isolation. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grq0a4wahznr8pw2m1nd1dqm" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A touch of aspiration is OK, but useful values should explain how effective employees navigate the organization as it exists today (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grq0cnrdmezt1t6jmzh92tb3" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The only way for your entire team to operate on the same values is to describe behavior honestly. (If you want to change company behavior, change the behavior first, and document it second.) (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grq0da0fwjwcpwd7t32ft3x7" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While you should try to avoid useless values, as long as they’re honest, they tend to be inert rather than harmful, so I wouldn’t spend too much time fighting against, particularly them if you’re working on values as a participant (e.g. for the company) rather than as the final decider (e.g. for engineering). (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grq0nqajnkwxx6hd92g55hqb" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The best way to think of the relationship between values and a strategy (business, technology, or otherwise) is that useful values generally can serve as a strategy’s guiding principle. Not all guiding principles are values (e.g. how you respond to a current market opportunity is unlikely to be a value), but most values are viable guiding principles. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grq0pev7118dw6a0k183bhme" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establishing values should follow
&lt;a href="https://lethain.com/good-process-is-evolved/" rel="noopener">the general patterns of good process rollout&lt;/a>: identify the opportunity, document potential options, involve stakeholders early to build buy-in, test before finalizing to avoid folks feeling trapped, and iterate until it’s useful. It’s easy to announce values, but much harder to introduce values that get used. Reduce that risk by including the wider team, listening, and iterating a few times to make them feel like a shared creation rather than a top-down one. (

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Approach conflict with curiosity.&lt;/strong> One of my foundational beliefs is that most professional conflict between reasonable people is driven by asymmetric information. If you approach conflict with curiosity, you can quickly learn the missing information and generally make the right decision without conflict. (

They define the key elements of a solution before we consider a project ready to bet on. Projects are defined at the right level of abstraction: concrete enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details themselves. (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The way a team works has an enormous influence on what it can do. The process, the methods, the practices, the approach, the discipline, the trust, the communication style, the pace. The way—the how—is foundational and fundamental. (

&lt;li>focus on “hammering” the scope to fit within a given time budget was born under these constraints. (

&lt;li>in six-week cycles. Six weeks is long enough to build something meaningful start-to-finish and short enough that everyone can feel the deadline looming from the start, so they use the time wisely. The (

&lt;li>we shape the work before giving it to a team. A small senior group works in parallel to the cycle teams. They define the key elements of a solution before we consider a project ready to bet on. Projects are defined at the right level of abstraction: concrete enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details themselves. (

&lt;li>appetite. Instead of asking how much time it will take to do some work, we ask: How much time do we want to spend? How much is this idea worth? This is the task of shaping: narrowing down the problem and designing the outline of a solution that fits within the constraints of our appetite. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre7xrpjam85z5by8p85rvqk" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we give full responsibility to a small integrated team of designers and programmers. They define their own tasks, make adjustments to the scope, and work together to build vertical slices of the product one at a time. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre7yr6wz7hrph5q431cx0gq" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When teams are more autonomous, senior people can spend less time managing them. With less time spent on management, senior people can shape up better projects. When projects are better shaped, teams have clearer boundaries and so can work more autonomously. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre82mjb23vtt4n78z5tqn43" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At every step of the process we target a specific risk: the risk of not shipping on time. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre867pa57xb4bfg6k6wzk77" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improving your discovery process should come after regaining your ability to ship. You can have the best strategy in the world, but if you can’t act on it, what good does it do? (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre84dt3aqyw36ghr8skxxq5" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We reduce risk in the planning process by capping our bets to six weeks. If a project runs over, by default it doesn’t get an extension. This “circuit breaker” ensures that we don’t invest multiples of the original appetite on a concept that needs rethinking first. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre85xex8h27bxef9vdkqbm1" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we reduce risk in the building process by integrating design and programming early. Instead of building lots of disconnected parts and hoping they’ll fit together in the 11th hour, we build one meaningful piece of the work end-to-end early on and then repeat. The team sequences the work from the most unknown to the least worrisome pieces and learns what works and what doesn’t by integrating as soon as possible. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre87cdpvsvf66xhbexzscwn" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we shape the work, we need to do it at the right level of abstraction: not too vague and not too concrete. Product managers often err on one of these two extremes. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre8fmgc1pmfgnckqvnnbkyg" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Over-specifying the design also leads to estimation errors. Counterintuitive as it may seem, the more specific the work is, the harder it can be to estimate. (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: This might be one of the major flaws of waterfall&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the scope isn’t variable, the team can’t reconsider a design decision that is turning out to cost more than it’s worth. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre8hxpzf8xrzzk6b8g5vbvw" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>projects that are too vague don’t work either. When a project is defined in a few words, nobody knows what it means. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre8p97p4jbpkjkjcan2vjb1" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Team members don’t have enough information to make trade-offs. They don’t know what to include or leave out (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre8pqy5menm7ewnf8rc3cy8" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>under-specified projects naturally grow out of control because there’s no boundary to define what’s out of scope. (

&lt;li>Work in the shaping stage is rough. Everyone can tell by looking at it that it’s unfinished. They can see the open spaces where their contributions will go. Work that’s too fine, too early commits

&lt;li>everyone to the wrong details. Designers and programmers need room to apply their own judgement and expertise when they roll up their sleeves and discover all the real trade-offs that emerge. (

&lt;li>Despite being rough and unfinished, shaped work has been thought through. All the main elements of the solution are there at the macro level and they connect together. (

&lt;li>shaped work indicates what not to do. It tells the team where to stop. There’s a specific appetite—the amount of time the team is allowed to spend on the project. Completing the project within that fixed amount of time requires limiting the scope and leaving specific things out (

&lt;li>Shaping is a closed-door, creative process. You might be alone sketching on paper or in front of a whiteboard with a close collaborator. There’ll be rough diagrams in front of you that nobody outside the room would be able to interpret. When working with a collaborator, you move fast, speak frankly and jump from one promising position to another. It’s that kind of private, rough, early work. (

&lt;li>Broadly sharing these insights, both those that come from answering stakeholder questions and those discovered when exploring the data on our own, can be beneficial in a variety of ways: (

&lt;li>Data teams often don’t get credit for their work, not because they do a poor job, but because the company culture doesn’t value data work regardless of its quality or quantity. (

&lt;li>Simpson’s paradox explains why an effect can disappear or reverse when data from different groups are combined without accounting for a confound or confounder — a third variable that influences both independent (or intervention or exposure) and dependent (or outcome) variables. (

&lt;li>Simpson’s success was prefiguring contemporary statistics reform efforts by emphasizing the need for qualitative knowledge — and not just expert knowledge in the traditional sense, but also, we might say, common sense — to play a central role in statistical analysis. (

&lt;li>So now we have three problems in talking about Simpson’s paradox: (1) it’s not Simpson’s, in the sense that he wasn’t the first to describe confounding, (2) there’s no paradox, in the sense that you should be thinking about causality early and often when doing statistics, and (3) Simpson’s example was inadvertently showing something closer to the numeric phenomenon of noncollapsibility, a failure of subgroups with high proportions to make simple averages in the aggregate, and not the causal phenomena of confounding that he thought he was talking abou (

&lt;li>&lt;em>Keep innovation and maintenance together&lt;/em>. A frequent practice is to spin up a new team to team to innovate while existing teams are bogged down in maintenance. I’ve historically done this myself, but I’ve moved towards
&lt;a href="https://lethain.com/durably-excellent-teams/" rel="noopener">innovating within existing teams&lt;/a>. (

&lt;li>• Teams should be six to eight during steady state.
• To create a new team, grow an existing team to eight to ten, and then bud into two teams of four or five.
• Never create empty teams.
• Never leave managers supporting more than eight folks. (

&lt;li>junior. Taking a step away from a more technical role closes doors. It&amp;rsquo;s not fair, but our industry biases are set up so that you really need to have a solid engineering resume before you take a non-engineering role (

&lt;li>industry. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some look back at engineer jobs and discover that they also can&amp;rsquo;t get hired at the level of developer they used to be, even if it was quite recent. As if the skills they had have evaporated. (

&lt;li>Document Note: This posts deals with an adaptation of
&lt;a href="https://teamtopologies.com/book" rel="noopener">Team Topology&lt;/a> to ML applications. In order to break the monolyth in smaller subsystems the book identifies team boundaries based on the cognitive load capacity of teams.
ML topologies:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Stream-aligned ML teams: Develop and manage ML applications for end-users. The scope of the team is determined by the cognitive load of the team. For instance, a recommender system solution might not vary much for residential and not residential assets, so a slightly larger team might deal with both. However, the recommender system might be very different for idealista users vs real estate agencies, requiring two different teams.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data/infrastructure subsystem teams: Data and infrastructure teams are different breads buy they are both specialist subsystem teams. These teams ensure data and infra management policy are centralized.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ML Platform teams: Develop end-to-end ML platforms so that stream-aligned ML teams do not have to worry about low-level management and communication between ML artifacts.&lt;/li>

You should start a project by setting a complexity limit guided by:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What is the minimum required accuracy of the model?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Will this project require some sort of scaling?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How much resources are available for the project&lt;/li>

&lt;li>It’s not an unfamiliar problem in other disciplines. Engineers have dealt with analogous problems for decades. In World War II, the US designed Sherman tank used highly interchangeable parts. If one tank was knocked out, parts could be taken from another [1]. The Sherman was a relatively simple machine, if it was damaged in battle it could be quickly repaired in the field [2].
On the other hand, Germany designed the Tiger. The Tiger was powerful, precise and complicated [2]. It was a tank as finely tuned as a Swiss watch. Allied forces deeply feared a fully operational Tiger. The problem was, how do you keep a Tiger running? Precision engineering means customization, of parts and knowledge. If you want to fix a Tiger, you need Tiger specific parts. If you want to fix a Tiger, you need Tiger specific expertise. (

&lt;li>The Sherman is the data science model built with little customization. Its developer continually monitoring the costs of complexity. Its parts are recognizable, interpretable and fixable for our colleagues. It is built efficiently and gets the job done with the appropriate level of accuracy. (

&lt;li>The Tiger is that data science model, so often built with great passion, whose developer was blind to the costs of complexity. It is an incredible machine, when it works. Its precision means it will break. When it breaks only a very small group of people will be capable of fixing it. (

&lt;li>It’s not an unfamiliar problem in other disciplines. Engineers have dealt with analogous problems for decades. In World War II, the US designed Sherman tank used highly interchangeable parts. If one tank was knocked out, parts could be taken from another [1]. The Sherman was a relatively simple machine, if it was damaged in battle it could be quickly repaired in the field [2].
On the other hand, Germany designed the Tiger. The Tiger was powerful, precise and complicated [2]. It was a tank as finely tuned as a Swiss watch. Allied forces deeply feared a fully operational Tiger. The problem was, how do you keep a Tiger running? Precision engineering means customization, of parts and knowledge. If you want to fix a Tiger, you need Tiger specific parts. If you want to fix a Tiger, you need Tiger specific expertise. (

&lt;li>The encoding component is a stack of encoders (the paper stacks six of them on top of each other – there’s nothing magical about the number six, one can definitely experiment with other arrangements). The decoding component is a stack of decoders of the same number. (

&lt;li>The encoders are all identical in structure (yet they do not share weights). Each one is broken down into two sub-layers: (

&lt;li>The encoder’s inputs first flow through a self-attention layer – a layer that helps the encoder look at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qw4a7944kyzwreqytcgxa" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position. (

&lt;li>The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence (similar what attention does in

&lt;li>As is the case in NLP applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector using an
&lt;a href="https://medium.com/deeper-learning/glossary-of-deep-learning-word-embedding-f90c3cec34ca" rel="noopener">embedding algorithm&lt;/a>. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43bvwwr560weacv3m72s65" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The embedding only happens in the bottom-most encoder. The abstraction that is common to all the encoders is that they receive a list of vectors each of the size 512 – In the bottom encoder that would be the word embeddings, but in other encoders, it would be the output of the encoder that’s directly below (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43d82ec8nqmyx1ekqz4vsy" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After embedding the words in our input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder. (

&lt;li>Here we begin to see one key property of the Transformer, which is that the word in each position flows through its own path in the encoder. There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, however, and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while flowing through the feed-forward layer. (

&lt;li>an encoder receives a list of vectors as input. It processes this list by passing these vectors into a ‘self-attention’ layer, then into a feed-forward neural network, then sends out the output upwards to the next encoder. (

&lt;li>Don’t be fooled by me throwing around the word “self-attention” like it’s a concept everyone should be familiar with. I had personally never came across the concept until reading the Attention is All You Need paper. Let us distill how it works.
Say the following sentence is an input sentence we want to translate:
”&lt;code>The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired&lt;/code>”
What does “it” in this sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or to the animal? It’s a simple question to a human, but not as simple to an algorithm. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43g439emrv0ppc47107xe6" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the model is processing the word “it”, self-attention allows it to associate “it” with “animal”. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gfpbp5215vsfmma0fs0e" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As the model processes each word (each position in the input sequence), self attention allows it to look at other positions in the input sequence for clues that can help lead to a better encoding for this word. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gpw4bc4n7f112ta03hft" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you’re familiar with RNNs, think of how maintaining a hidden state allows an RNN to incorporate its representation of previous words/vectors it has processed with the current one it’s processing. Self-attention is the method the Transformer uses to bake the “understanding” of other relevant words into the one we’re currently processing. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43h3k8ahj564hz5njbse37" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>first step&lt;/strong> in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoder’s input vectors (in this case, the embedding of each word). So for each word, we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. These vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43j1j705y3zjy6nrp5ns5v" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Notice that these new vectors are smaller in dimension than the embedding vector. Their dimensionality is 64, while the embedding and encoder input/output vectors have dimensionality of 512. They don’t HAVE to be smaller, this is an architecture choice to make the computation of multiheaded attention (mostly) constant. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43jkm0z72sfsdp5262dmsw" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are the “query”, “key”, and “value” vectors?
They’re abstractions that are useful for calculating and thinking about attention. Once you proceed with reading how attention is calculated below, you’ll know pretty much all you need to know about the role each of these vectors plays.
The &lt;strong>second step&lt;/strong> in calculating self-attention is to calculate a score. Say we’re calculating the self-attention for the first word in this example, “Thinking”. We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word. The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kds63qrdqsk5tw2dhknp" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The score is calculated by taking the dot product of the query vector with the key vector of the respective word we’re scoring. So if we’re processing the self-attention for the word in position #1, the first score would be the dot product of q1 and k1. The second score would be the dot product of q1 and k2. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ksg4fqem6rse31ga8gav" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>

&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kvr3434ae2v73chyhv9e" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>third and fourth steps&lt;/strong> are to divide the scores by 8 (the square root of the dimension of the key vectors used in the paper – 64. This leads to having more stable gradients. There could be other possible values here, but this is the default), then pass the result through a softmax operation. Softmax normalizes the scores so they’re all positive and add up to 1. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43mggpdphmyfpht1a6s0cy" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention_softmax.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43rg7bw2v9aw5a2hr2f2f8" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>his softmax score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position. Clearly the word at this position will have the highest softmax score, but sometimes it’s useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the current word. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43n1q3mav0cybysjmsbkt9" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>fifth step&lt;/strong> is to multiply each value vector by the softmax score (in preparation to sum them up). The intuition here is to keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on, and drown-out irrelevant words (by multiplying them by tiny numbers like 0.001, for example) (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43natm8kn4nej6xgepqh08" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>sixth step&lt;/strong> is to sum up the weighted value vectors. This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this position (for the first word). (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43r0r605atfm28k8d0qxwc" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-output.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43rjb5qjeebyfdqcaftnz2" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That concludes the self-attention calculation. The resulting vector is one we can send along to the feed-forward neural network. In the actual implementation, however, this calculation is done in matrix form for faster processing. So let’s look at that now that we’ve seen the intuition of the calculation on the word level. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43r88wb5xxryx9qmqenvgz" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Matrix Calculation of Self-Attention
&lt;strong>The first step&lt;/strong> is to calculate the Query, Key, and Value matrices. We do that by packing our embeddings into a matrix X, and multiplying it by the weight matrices we’ve trained (WQ, WK, WV). (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43s12mtkh4d0g4pvc8m0w5" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ry83pv2qkve5h59a8yw7" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Finally&lt;/strong>, since we’re dealing with matrices, we can condense steps two through six in one formula to calculate the outputs of the self-attention layer.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation-2.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ssjaecxkvwnz37dejpyy" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The paper further refined the self-attention layer by adding a mechanism called “multi-headed” attention. This improves the performance of the attention layer in two ways:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>It expands the model’s ability to focus on different positions. Yes, in the example above, z1 contains a little bit of every other encoding, but it could be dominated by the actual word itself. If we’re translating a sentence like “The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired”, it would be useful to know which word “it” refers to. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43tgjwvw3dkd7fjx70q6by" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It gives the attention layer multiple “representation subspaces”. As we’ll see next, with multi-headed attention we have not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/Value weight matrices (the Transformer uses eight attention heads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder). Each of these sets is randomly initialized. Then, after training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a different representation subspace.

&lt;li>f we do the same self-attention calculation we outlined above, just eight different times with different weight matrices, we end up with eight different Z matrices

&lt;li>This leaves us with a bit of a challenge. The feed-forward layer is not expecting eight matrices – it’s expecting a single matrix (a vector for each word). So we need a way to condense these eight down into a single matrix.
How do we do that? We concat the matrices then multiply them by an additional weights matrix WO.

&lt;li>That’s pretty much all there is to multi-headed self-attention. It’s quite a handful of matrices, I realize. Let me try to put them all in one visual so we can look at them in one place (

&lt;li>Now that we have touched upon attention heads, let’s revisit our example from before to see where the different attention heads are focusing as we encode the word “it” in our example sentence:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_2.png" width="auto" alt="" />
As we encode the word &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo;, one attention head is focusing most on &amp;ldquo;the animal&amp;rdquo;, while another is focusing on &amp;ldquo;tired&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; in a sense, the model&amp;rsquo;s representation of the word &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo; bakes in some of the representation of both &amp;ldquo;animal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;tired&amp;rdquo;.
If we add all the attention heads to the picture, however, things can be harder to interpret:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_3.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43yat77cam7ysnc577vh70" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One thing that’s missing from the model as we have described it so far is a way to account for the order of the words in the input sequence.
To address this, the transformer adds a vector to each input embedding. These vectors follow a specific pattern that the model learns, which helps it determine the position of each word, or the distance between different words in the sequence. The intuition here is that adding these values to the embeddings provides meaningful distances between the embedding vectors once they’re projected into Q/K/V vectors and during dot-product attention. (

&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_vectors.png" width="auto" alt="" />
To give the model a sense of the order of the words, we add positional encoding vectors &amp;ndash; the values of which follow a specific pattern.
If we assumed the embedding has a dimensionality of 4, the actual positional encodings would look like this:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_example.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43znch1bsfjnb2b928qek7" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One detail in the architecture of the encoder that we need to mention before moving on, is that each sub-layer (self-attention, ffnn) in each encoder has a residual connection around it, and is followed by a
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450" rel="noopener">layer-normalization&lt;/a> step.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr440f4v2m98ewn3esstkrv8" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we’re to visualize the vectors and the layer-norm operation associated with self attention, it would look like this:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_2.png" width="auto" alt="" />
This goes for the sub-layers of the decoder as well. If we’re to think of a Transformer of 2 stacked encoders and decoders, it would look something like this:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_3.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4413g6rgtjkqb5vw6brsbw" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now that we’ve covered most of the concepts on the encoder side, we basically know how the components of decoders work as well. But let’s take a look at how they work together.
The encoder start by processing the input sequence. The output of the top encoder is then transformed into a set of attention vectors K and V. These are to be used by each decoder in its “encoder-decoder attention” layer which helps the decoder focus on appropriate places in the input sequence: (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr441fp3bt80av1s3zq5df63" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_1.gif" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr441tgtwqrtp61jmjh4gr26" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The following steps repeat the process until a special symbol is reached indicating the transformer decoder has completed its output. The output of each step is fed to the bottom decoder in the next time step, and the decoders bubble up their decoding results just like the encoders did. And just like we did with the encoder inputs, we embed and add positional encoding to those decoder inputs to indicate the position of each word.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_2.gif" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4422r1a9ggxktc1bjvk6qf" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The self attention layers in the decoder operate in a slightly different way than the one in the encoder:
In the decoder, the self-attention layer is only allowed to attend to earlier positions in the output sequence. This is done by masking future positions (setting them to &lt;code>-inf&lt;/code>) before the softmax step in the self-attention calculation.
The “Encoder-Decoder Attention” layer works just like multiheaded self-attention, except it creates its Queries matrix from the layer below it, and takes the Keys and Values matrix from the output of the encoder stack. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr442gq9g1s6t401zvnszsbg" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The decoder stack outputs a vector of floats. How do we turn that into a word? That’s the job of the final Linear layer which is followed by a Softmax Layer.
The Linear layer is a simple fully connected neural network that projects the vector produced by the stack of decoders, into a much, much larger vector called a logits vector.
Let’s assume that our model knows 10,000 unique English words (our model’s “output vocabulary”) that it’s learned from its training dataset. This would make the logits vector 10,000 cells wide – each cell corresponding to the score of a unique word. That is how we interpret the output of the model followed by the Linear layer.
The softmax layer then turns those scores into probabilities (all positive, all add up to 1.0). The cell with the highest probability is chosen, and the word associated with it is produced as the output for this time step. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4436kday4y5drby2w9f7tc" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now that we’ve covered the entire forward-pass process through a trained Transformer, it would be useful to glance at the intuition of training the model.
During training, an untrained model would go through the exact same forward pass. But since we are training it on a labeled training dataset, we can compare its output with the actual correct output.
To visualize this, let’s assume our output vocabulary only contains six words(“a”, “am”, “i”, “thanks”, “student”, and “&lt;eos>” (short for ‘end of sentence’)). (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr443x9f8v1vp5wr32c61w5n" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/vocabulary.png" width="auto" alt="" />
The output vocabulary of our model is created in the preprocessing phase before we even begin training. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444rwtqjn4t79nrm00egbd" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once we define our output vocabulary, we can use a vector of the same width to indicate each word in our vocabulary. This also known as one-hot encoding. So for example, we can indicate the word “am” using the following vector: (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444akq9ps9fbk8fbx68zxy" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/one-hot-vocabulary-example.png" width="auto" alt="" />
Example: one-hot encoding of our output vocabulary (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444ptpa7ancdtj89zmjjd6" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Loss Function
Say we are training our model. Say it’s our first step in the training phase, and we’re training it on a simple example – translating “merci” into “thanks”.
What this means, is that we want the output to be a probability distribution indicating the word “thanks”. But since this model is not yet trained, that’s unlikely to happen just yet.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_logits_output_and_label.png" width="auto" alt="" />
Since the model&amp;rsquo;s parameters (weights) are all initialized randomly, the (untrained) model produces a probability distribution with arbitrary values for each cell/word. We can compare it with the actual output, then tweak all the model&amp;rsquo;s weights using backpropagation to make the output closer to the desired output. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr445m67n0aw8x514vrk2xb3" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But note that this is an oversimplified example. More realistically, we’ll use a sentence longer than one word. For example – input: “je suis étudiant” and expected output: “i am a student”. What this really means, is that we want our model to successively output probability distributions where:
• Each probability distribution is represented by a vector of width vocab_size (6 in our toy example, but more realistically a number like 30,000 or 50,000)
• The first probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “i”
• The second probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “am”
• And so on, until the fifth output distribution indicates ‘&lt;code>&amp;lt;end of sentence&amp;gt;&lt;/code>’ symbol, which also has a cell associated with it from the 10,000 element vocabulary.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/output_target_probability_distributions.png" width="auto" alt="" />
The targeted probability distributions we&amp;rsquo;ll train our model against in the training example for one sample sentence. (

&lt;li>The encoding component is a stack of encoders (the paper stacks six of them on top of each other – there’s nothing magical about the number six, one can definitely experiment with other arrangements). The decoding component is a stack of decoders of the same number. (

&lt;li>The encoders are all identical in structure (yet they do not share weights). Each one is broken down into two sub-layers: (

&lt;li>The encoder’s inputs first flow through a self-attention layer – a layer that helps the encoder look at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word. (

&lt;li>The outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position. (

&lt;li>The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence (similar what attention does in

&lt;li>As is the case in NLP applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector using an

&lt;li>The embedding only happens in the bottom-most encoder. The abstraction that is common to all the encoders is that they receive a list of vectors each of the size 512 – In the bottom encoder that would be the word embeddings, but in other encoders, it would be the output of the encoder that’s directly below (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43d82ec8nqmyx1ekqz4vsy" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After embedding the words in our input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder. (

&lt;li>Here we begin to see one key property of the Transformer, which is that the word in each position flows through its own path in the encoder. There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, however, and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while flowing through the feed-forward layer. (

&lt;li>an encoder receives a list of vectors as input. It processes this list by passing these vectors into a ‘self-attention’ layer, then into a feed-forward neural network, then sends out the output upwards to the next encoder. (

&lt;li>Don’t be fooled by me throwing around the word “self-attention” like it’s a concept everyone should be familiar with. I had personally never came across the concept until reading the Attention is All You Need paper. Let us distill how it works.
Say the following sentence is an input sentence we want to translate:
”&lt;code>The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired&lt;/code>”
What does “it” in this sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or to the animal? It’s a simple question to a human, but not as simple to an algorithm. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43g439emrv0ppc47107xe6" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the model is processing the word “it”, self-attention allows it to associate “it” with “animal”. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gfpbp5215vsfmma0fs0e" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As the model processes each word (each position in the input sequence), self attention allows it to look at other positions in the input sequence for clues that can help lead to a better encoding for this word. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gpw4bc4n7f112ta03hft" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you’re familiar with RNNs, think of how maintaining a hidden state allows an RNN to incorporate its representation of previous words/vectors it has processed with the current one it’s processing. Self-attention is the method the Transformer uses to bake the “understanding” of other relevant words into the one we’re currently processing. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43h3k8ahj564hz5njbse37" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>first step&lt;/strong> in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoder’s input vectors (in this case, the embedding of each word). So for each word, we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. These vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43j1j705y3zjy6nrp5ns5v" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Notice that these new vectors are smaller in dimension than the embedding vector. Their dimensionality is 64, while the embedding and encoder input/output vectors have dimensionality of 512. They don’t HAVE to be smaller, this is an architecture choice to make the computation of multiheaded attention (mostly) constant. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43jkm0z72sfsdp5262dmsw" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are the “query”, “key”, and “value” vectors?
They’re abstractions that are useful for calculating and thinking about attention. Once you proceed with reading how attention is calculated below, you’ll know pretty much all you need to know about the role each of these vectors plays.
The &lt;strong>second step&lt;/strong> in calculating self-attention is to calculate a score. Say we’re calculating the self-attention for the first word in this example, “Thinking”. We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word. The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kds63qrdqsk5tw2dhknp" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The score is calculated by taking the dot product of the query vector with the key vector of the respective word we’re scoring. So if we’re processing the self-attention for the word in position #1, the first score would be the dot product of q1 and k1. The second score would be the dot product of q1 and k2. (

&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kvr3434ae2v73chyhv9e" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>third and fourth steps&lt;/strong> are to divide the scores by 8 (the square root of the dimension of the key vectors used in the paper – 64. This leads to having more stable gradients. There could be other possible values here, but this is the default), then pass the result through a softmax operation. Softmax normalizes the scores so they’re all positive and add up to 1. (

&lt;li>his softmax score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position. Clearly the word at this position will have the highest softmax score, but sometimes it’s useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the current word. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43n1q3mav0cybysjmsbkt9" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>fifth step&lt;/strong> is to multiply each value vector by the softmax score (in preparation to sum them up). The intuition here is to keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on, and drown-out irrelevant words (by multiplying them by tiny numbers like 0.001, for example) (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43natm8kn4nej6xgepqh08" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>sixth step&lt;/strong> is to sum up the weighted value vectors. This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this position (for the first word). (

&lt;li>That concludes the self-attention calculation. The resulting vector is one we can send along to the feed-forward neural network. In the actual implementation, however, this calculation is done in matrix form for faster processing. So let’s look at that now that we’ve seen the intuition of the calculation on the word level. (

&lt;li>Matrix Calculation of Self-Attention
&lt;strong>The first step&lt;/strong> is to calculate the Query, Key, and Value matrices. We do that by packing our embeddings into a matrix X, and multiplying it by the weight matrices we’ve trained (WQ, WK, WV). (

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Finally&lt;/strong>, since we’re dealing with matrices, we can condense steps two through six in one formula to calculate the outputs of the self-attention layer.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation-2.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (

&lt;li>The paper further refined the self-attention layer by adding a mechanism called “multi-headed” attention. This improves the performance of the attention layer in two ways:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>It expands the model’s ability to focus on different positions. Yes, in the example above, z1 contains a little bit of every other encoding, but it could be dominated by the actual word itself. If we’re translating a sentence like “The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired”, it would be useful to know which word “it” refers to. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43tgjwvw3dkd7fjx70q6by" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It gives the attention layer multiple “representation subspaces”. As we’ll see next, with multi-headed attention we have not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/Value weight matrices (the Transformer uses eight attention heads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder). Each of these sets is randomly initialized. Then, after training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a different representation subspace. (

&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43v18wvm97ydchy62d2fg7" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>f we do the same self-attention calculation we outlined above, just eight different times with different weight matrices, we end up with eight different Z matrices
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_z.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43v47h8vhrd36nkabghtxk" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This leaves us with a bit of a challenge. The feed-forward layer is not expecting eight matrices – it’s expecting a single matrix (a vector for each word). So we need a way to condense these eight down into a single matrix.
How do we do that? We concat the matrices then multiply them by an additional weights matrix WO.

&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43vh72mghvq1ez0345p7tn" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That’s pretty much all there is to multi-headed self-attention. It’s quite a handful of matrices, I realize. Let me try to put them all in one visual so we can look at them in one place (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43vw9h0v6s4ys2pk44e428" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>

&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43wyr08hq72r7ntkn6jya2" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now that we have touched upon attention heads, let’s revisit our example from before to see where the different attention heads are focusing as we encode the word “it” in our example sentence:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_2.png" width="auto" alt="" />
As we encode the word &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo;, one attention head is focusing most on &amp;ldquo;the animal&amp;rdquo;, while another is focusing on &amp;ldquo;tired&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; in a sense, the model&amp;rsquo;s representation of the word &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo; bakes in some of the representation of both &amp;ldquo;animal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;tired&amp;rdquo;.
If we add all the attention heads to the picture, however, things can be harder to interpret:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_3.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43yat77cam7ysnc577vh70" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One thing that’s missing from the model as we have described it so far is a way to account for the order of the words in the input sequence.
To address this, the transformer adds a vector to each input embedding. These vectors follow a specific pattern that the model learns, which helps it determine the position of each word, or the distance between different words in the sequence. The intuition here is that adding these values to the embeddings provides meaningful distances between the embedding vectors once they’re projected into Q/K/V vectors and during dot-product attention. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43yyj61gv31j0syr73xyga" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_vectors.png" width="auto" alt="" />
To give the model a sense of the order of the words, we add positional encoding vectors &amp;ndash; the values of which follow a specific pattern.
If we assumed the embedding has a dimensionality of 4, the actual positional encodings would look like this:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_example.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43znch1bsfjnb2b928qek7" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One detail in the architecture of the encoder that we need to mention before moving on, is that each sub-layer (self-attention, ffnn) in each encoder has a residual connection around it, and is followed by a
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450" rel="noopener">layer-normalization&lt;/a> step.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr440f4v2m98ewn3esstkrv8" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we’re to visualize the vectors and the layer-norm operation associated with self attention, it would look like this:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_2.png" width="auto" alt="" />
This goes for the sub-layers of the decoder as well. If we’re to think of a Transformer of 2 stacked encoders and decoders, it would look something like this:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_3.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4413g6rgtjkqb5vw6brsbw" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now that we’ve covered most of the concepts on the encoder side, we basically know how the components of decoders work as well. But let’s take a look at how they work together.
The encoder start by processing the input sequence. The output of the top encoder is then transformed into a set of attention vectors K and V. These are to be used by each decoder in its “encoder-decoder attention” layer which helps the decoder focus on appropriate places in the input sequence: (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr441fp3bt80av1s3zq5df63" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_1.gif" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr441tgtwqrtp61jmjh4gr26" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The following steps repeat the process until a special symbol is reached indicating the transformer decoder has completed its output. The output of each step is fed to the bottom decoder in the next time step, and the decoders bubble up their decoding results just like the encoders did. And just like we did with the encoder inputs, we embed and add positional encoding to those decoder inputs to indicate the position of each word.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_2.gif" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4422r1a9ggxktc1bjvk6qf" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The self attention layers in the decoder operate in a slightly different way than the one in the encoder:
In the decoder, the self-attention layer is only allowed to attend to earlier positions in the output sequence. This is done by masking future positions (setting them to &lt;code>-inf&lt;/code>) before the softmax step in the self-attention calculation.
The “Encoder-Decoder Attention” layer works just like multiheaded self-attention, except it creates its Queries matrix from the layer below it, and takes the Keys and Values matrix from the output of the encoder stack. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr442gq9g1s6t401zvnszsbg" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The decoder stack outputs a vector of floats. How do we turn that into a word? That’s the job of the final Linear layer which is followed by a Softmax Layer.
The Linear layer is a simple fully connected neural network that projects the vector produced by the stack of decoders, into a much, much larger vector called a logits vector.
Let’s assume that our model knows 10,000 unique English words (our model’s “output vocabulary”) that it’s learned from its training dataset. This would make the logits vector 10,000 cells wide – each cell corresponding to the score of a unique word. That is how we interpret the output of the model followed by the Linear layer.
The softmax layer then turns those scores into probabilities (all positive, all add up to 1.0). The cell with the highest probability is chosen, and the word associated with it is produced as the output for this time step. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4436kday4y5drby2w9f7tc" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now that we’ve covered the entire forward-pass process through a trained Transformer, it would be useful to glance at the intuition of training the model.
During training, an untrained model would go through the exact same forward pass. But since we are training it on a labeled training dataset, we can compare its output with the actual correct output.
To visualize this, let’s assume our output vocabulary only contains six words(“a”, “am”, “i”, “thanks”, “student”, and “&lt;eos>” (short for ‘end of sentence’)). (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr443x9f8v1vp5wr32c61w5n" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/vocabulary.png" width="auto" alt="" />
The output vocabulary of our model is created in the preprocessing phase before we even begin training. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444rwtqjn4t79nrm00egbd" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once we define our output vocabulary, we can use a vector of the same width to indicate each word in our vocabulary. This also known as one-hot encoding. So for example, we can indicate the word “am” using the following vector: (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444akq9ps9fbk8fbx68zxy" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/one-hot-vocabulary-example.png" width="auto" alt="" />
Example: one-hot encoding of our output vocabulary (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444ptpa7ancdtj89zmjjd6" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Loss Function
Say we are training our model. Say it’s our first step in the training phase, and we’re training it on a simple example – translating “merci” into “thanks”.
What this means, is that we want the output to be a probability distribution indicating the word “thanks”. But since this model is not yet trained, that’s unlikely to happen just yet.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_logits_output_and_label.png" width="auto" alt="" />
Since the model&amp;rsquo;s parameters (weights) are all initialized randomly, the (untrained) model produces a probability distribution with arbitrary values for each cell/word. We can compare it with the actual output, then tweak all the model&amp;rsquo;s weights using backpropagation to make the output closer to the desired output. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr445m67n0aw8x514vrk2xb3" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But note that this is an oversimplified example. More realistically, we’ll use a sentence longer than one word. For example – input: “je suis étudiant” and expected output: “i am a student”. What this really means, is that we want our model to successively output probability distributions where:
• Each probability distribution is represented by a vector of width vocab_size (6 in our toy example, but more realistically a number like 30,000 or 50,000)
• The first probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “i”
• The second probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “am”
• And so on, until the fifth output distribution indicates ‘&lt;code>&amp;lt;end of sentence&amp;gt;&lt;/code>’ symbol, which also has a cell associated with it from the 10,000 element vocabulary.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/output_target_probability_distributions.png" width="auto" alt="" />
The targeted probability distributions we&amp;rsquo;ll train our model against in the training example for one sample sentence. (

&lt;li>The encoding component is a stack of encoders (the paper stacks six of them on top of each other – there’s nothing magical about the number six, one can definitely experiment with other arrangements). The decoding component is a stack of decoders of the same number. (

&lt;li>The encoders are all identical in structure (yet they do not share weights). Each one is broken down into two sub-layers: (

&lt;li>The encoder’s inputs first flow through a self-attention layer – a layer that helps the encoder look at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word. (

&lt;li>The outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position. (

&lt;li>The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence (similar what attention does in

&lt;li>As is the case in NLP applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector using an
&lt;a href="https://medium.com/deeper-learning/glossary-of-deep-learning-word-embedding-f90c3cec34ca" rel="noopener">embedding algorithm&lt;/a>. (

&lt;li>The embedding only happens in the bottom-most encoder. The abstraction that is common to all the encoders is that they receive a list of vectors each of the size 512 – In the bottom encoder that would be the word embeddings, but in other encoders, it would be the output of the encoder that’s directly below (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43d82ec8nqmyx1ekqz4vsy" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After embedding the words in our input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder. (

&lt;li>Here we begin to see one key property of the Transformer, which is that the word in each position flows through its own path in the encoder. There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, however, and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while flowing through the feed-forward layer. (

&lt;li>an encoder receives a list of vectors as input. It processes this list by passing these vectors into a ‘self-attention’ layer, then into a feed-forward neural network, then sends out the output upwards to the next encoder. (

&lt;li>Don’t be fooled by me throwing around the word “self-attention” like it’s a concept everyone should be familiar with. I had personally never came across the concept until reading the Attention is All You Need paper. Let us distill how it works.
Say the following sentence is an input sentence we want to translate:
”&lt;code>The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired&lt;/code>”
What does “it” in this sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or to the animal? It’s a simple question to a human, but not as simple to an algorithm. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43g439emrv0ppc47107xe6" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the model is processing the word “it”, self-attention allows it to associate “it” with “animal”. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gfpbp5215vsfmma0fs0e" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As the model processes each word (each position in the input sequence), self attention allows it to look at other positions in the input sequence for clues that can help lead to a better encoding for this word. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gpw4bc4n7f112ta03hft" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you’re familiar with RNNs, think of how maintaining a hidden state allows an RNN to incorporate its representation of previous words/vectors it has processed with the current one it’s processing. Self-attention is the method the Transformer uses to bake the “understanding” of other relevant words into the one we’re currently processing. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43h3k8ahj564hz5njbse37" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>first step&lt;/strong> in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoder’s input vectors (in this case, the embedding of each word). So for each word, we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. These vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43j1j705y3zjy6nrp5ns5v" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Notice that these new vectors are smaller in dimension than the embedding vector. Their dimensionality is 64, while the embedding and encoder input/output vectors have dimensionality of 512. They don’t HAVE to be smaller, this is an architecture choice to make the computation of multiheaded attention (mostly) constant. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43jkm0z72sfsdp5262dmsw" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are the “query”, “key”, and “value” vectors?
They’re abstractions that are useful for calculating and thinking about attention. Once you proceed with reading how attention is calculated below, you’ll know pretty much all you need to know about the role each of these vectors plays.
The &lt;strong>second step&lt;/strong> in calculating self-attention is to calculate a score. Say we’re calculating the self-attention for the first word in this example, “Thinking”. We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word. The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kds63qrdqsk5tw2dhknp" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The score is calculated by taking the dot product of the query vector with the key vector of the respective word we’re scoring. So if we’re processing the self-attention for the word in position #1, the first score would be the dot product of q1 and k1. The second score would be the dot product of q1 and k2. (

&lt;li>The &lt;strong>third and fourth steps&lt;/strong> are to divide the scores by 8 (the square root of the dimension of the key vectors used in the paper – 64. This leads to having more stable gradients. There could be other possible values here, but this is the default), then pass the result through a softmax operation. Softmax normalizes the scores so they’re all positive and add up to 1. (

&lt;li>his softmax score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position. Clearly the word at this position will have the highest softmax score, but sometimes it’s useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the current word. (

&lt;li>The &lt;strong>fifth step&lt;/strong> is to multiply each value vector by the softmax score (in preparation to sum them up). The intuition here is to keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on, and drown-out irrelevant words (by multiplying them by tiny numbers like 0.001, for example) (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43natm8kn4nej6xgepqh08" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>sixth step&lt;/strong> is to sum up the weighted value vectors. This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this position (for the first word). (

&lt;li>That concludes the self-attention calculation. The resulting vector is one we can send along to the feed-forward neural network. In the actual implementation, however, this calculation is done in matrix form for faster processing. So let’s look at that now that we’ve seen the intuition of the calculation on the word level. (

&lt;li>Matrix Calculation of Self-Attention
&lt;strong>The first step&lt;/strong> is to calculate the Query, Key, and Value matrices. We do that by packing our embeddings into a matrix X, and multiplying it by the weight matrices we’ve trained (WQ, WK, WV). (

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Finally&lt;/strong>, since we’re dealing with matrices, we can condense steps two through six in one formula to calculate the outputs of the self-attention layer.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation-2.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ssjaecxkvwnz37dejpyy" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The paper further refined the self-attention layer by adding a mechanism called “multi-headed” attention. This improves the performance of the attention layer in two ways:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>It expands the model’s ability to focus on different positions. Yes, in the example above, z1 contains a little bit of every other encoding, but it could be dominated by the actual word itself. If we’re translating a sentence like “The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired”, it would be useful to know which word “it” refers to. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43tgjwvw3dkd7fjx70q6by" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It gives the attention layer multiple “representation subspaces”. As we’ll see next, with multi-headed attention we have not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/Value weight matrices (the Transformer uses eight attention heads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder). Each of these sets is randomly initialized. Then, after training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a different representation subspace. (

&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43v18wvm97ydchy62d2fg7" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>f we do the same self-attention calculation we outlined above, just eight different times with different weight matrices, we end up with eight different Z matrices
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_z.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43v47h8vhrd36nkabghtxk" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This leaves us with a bit of a challenge. The feed-forward layer is not expecting eight matrices – it’s expecting a single matrix (a vector for each word). So we need a way to condense these eight down into a single matrix.
How do we do that? We concat the matrices then multiply them by an additional weights matrix WO.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_weight_matrix_o.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43vh72mghvq1ez0345p7tn" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That’s pretty much all there is to multi-headed self-attention. It’s quite a handful of matrices, I realize. Let me try to put them all in one visual so we can look at them in one place (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43vw9h0v6s4ys2pk44e428" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>

&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43wyr08hq72r7ntkn6jya2" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now that we have touched upon attention heads, let’s revisit our example from before to see where the different attention heads are focusing as we encode the word “it” in our example sentence:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_2.png" width="auto" alt="" />
As we encode the word &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo;, one attention head is focusing most on &amp;ldquo;the animal&amp;rdquo;, while another is focusing on &amp;ldquo;tired&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; in a sense, the model&amp;rsquo;s representation of the word &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo; bakes in some of the representation of both &amp;ldquo;animal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;tired&amp;rdquo;.
If we add all the attention heads to the picture, however, things can be harder to interpret:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_3.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43yat77cam7ysnc577vh70" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One thing that’s missing from the model as we have described it so far is a way to account for the order of the words in the input sequence.
To address this, the transformer adds a vector to each input embedding. These vectors follow a specific pattern that the model learns, which helps it determine the position of each word, or the distance between different words in the sequence. The intuition here is that adding these values to the embeddings provides meaningful distances between the embedding vectors once they’re projected into Q/K/V vectors and during dot-product attention. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43yyj61gv31j0syr73xyga" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_vectors.png" width="auto" alt="" />
To give the model a sense of the order of the words, we add positional encoding vectors &amp;ndash; the values of which follow a specific pattern.
If we assumed the embedding has a dimensionality of 4, the actual positional encodings would look like this:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_example.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43znch1bsfjnb2b928qek7" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One detail in the architecture of the encoder that we need to mention before moving on, is that each sub-layer (self-attention, ffnn) in each encoder has a residual connection around it, and is followed by a
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450" rel="noopener">layer-normalization&lt;/a> step.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr440f4v2m98ewn3esstkrv8" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we’re to visualize the vectors and the layer-norm operation associated with self attention, it would look like this:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_2.png" width="auto" alt="" />
This goes for the sub-layers of the decoder as well. If we’re to think of a Transformer of 2 stacked encoders and decoders, it would look something like this:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_3.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4413g6rgtjkqb5vw6brsbw" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now that we’ve covered most of the concepts on the encoder side, we basically know how the components of decoders work as well. But let’s take a look at how they work together.
The encoder start by processing the input sequence. The output of the top encoder is then transformed into a set of attention vectors K and V. These are to be used by each decoder in its “encoder-decoder attention” layer which helps the decoder focus on appropriate places in the input sequence: (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr441fp3bt80av1s3zq5df63" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_1.gif" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr441tgtwqrtp61jmjh4gr26" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The following steps repeat the process until a special symbol is reached indicating the transformer decoder has completed its output. The output of each step is fed to the bottom decoder in the next time step, and the decoders bubble up their decoding results just like the encoders did. And just like we did with the encoder inputs, we embed and add positional encoding to those decoder inputs to indicate the position of each word.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_2.gif" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4422r1a9ggxktc1bjvk6qf" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The self attention layers in the decoder operate in a slightly different way than the one in the encoder:
In the decoder, the self-attention layer is only allowed to attend to earlier positions in the output sequence. This is done by masking future positions (setting them to &lt;code>-inf&lt;/code>) before the softmax step in the self-attention calculation.
The “Encoder-Decoder Attention” layer works just like multiheaded self-attention, except it creates its Queries matrix from the layer below it, and takes the Keys and Values matrix from the output of the encoder stack. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr442gq9g1s6t401zvnszsbg" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The decoder stack outputs a vector of floats. How do we turn that into a word? That’s the job of the final Linear layer which is followed by a Softmax Layer.
The Linear layer is a simple fully connected neural network that projects the vector produced by the stack of decoders, into a much, much larger vector called a logits vector.
Let’s assume that our model knows 10,000 unique English words (our model’s “output vocabulary”) that it’s learned from its training dataset. This would make the logits vector 10,000 cells wide – each cell corresponding to the score of a unique word. That is how we interpret the output of the model followed by the Linear layer.
The softmax layer then turns those scores into probabilities (all positive, all add up to 1.0). The cell with the highest probability is chosen, and the word associated with it is produced as the output for this time step. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4436kday4y5drby2w9f7tc" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now that we’ve covered the entire forward-pass process through a trained Transformer, it would be useful to glance at the intuition of training the model.
During training, an untrained model would go through the exact same forward pass. But since we are training it on a labeled training dataset, we can compare its output with the actual correct output.
To visualize this, let’s assume our output vocabulary only contains six words(“a”, “am”, “i”, “thanks”, “student”, and “&lt;eos>” (short for ‘end of sentence’)). (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr443x9f8v1vp5wr32c61w5n" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/vocabulary.png" width="auto" alt="" />
The output vocabulary of our model is created in the preprocessing phase before we even begin training. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444rwtqjn4t79nrm00egbd" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once we define our output vocabulary, we can use a vector of the same width to indicate each word in our vocabulary. This also known as one-hot encoding. So for example, we can indicate the word “am” using the following vector: (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444akq9ps9fbk8fbx68zxy" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/one-hot-vocabulary-example.png" width="auto" alt="" />
Example: one-hot encoding of our output vocabulary (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444ptpa7ancdtj89zmjjd6" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Loss Function
Say we are training our model. Say it’s our first step in the training phase, and we’re training it on a simple example – translating “merci” into “thanks”.
What this means, is that we want the output to be a probability distribution indicating the word “thanks”. But since this model is not yet trained, that’s unlikely to happen just yet.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_logits_output_and_label.png" width="auto" alt="" />
Since the model&amp;rsquo;s parameters (weights) are all initialized randomly, the (untrained) model produces a probability distribution with arbitrary values for each cell/word. We can compare it with the actual output, then tweak all the model&amp;rsquo;s weights using backpropagation to make the output closer to the desired output. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr445m67n0aw8x514vrk2xb3" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But note that this is an oversimplified example. More realistically, we’ll use a sentence longer than one word. For example – input: “je suis étudiant” and expected output: “i am a student”. What this really means, is that we want our model to successively output probability distributions where:
• Each probability distribution is represented by a vector of width vocab_size (6 in our toy example, but more realistically a number like 30,000 or 50,000)
• The first probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “i”
• The second probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “am”
• And so on, until the fifth output distribution indicates ‘&lt;code>&amp;lt;end of sentence&amp;gt;&lt;/code>’ symbol, which also has a cell associated with it from the 10,000 element vocabulary.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/output_target_probability_distributions.png" width="auto" alt="" />
The targeted probability distributions we&amp;rsquo;ll train our model against in the training example for one sample sentence. (

&lt;li>The encoding component is a stack of encoders (the paper stacks six of them on top of each other – there’s nothing magical about the number six, one can definitely experiment with other arrangements). The decoding component is a stack of decoders of the same number. (

&lt;li>The encoders are all identical in structure (yet they do not share weights). Each one is broken down into two sub-layers: (

&lt;li>The encoder’s inputs first flow through a self-attention layer – a layer that helps the encoder look at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word. (

&lt;li>The outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position. (

&lt;li>The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence (similar what attention does in
&lt;a href="https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/" rel="noopener">seq2seq models&lt;/a>). (

&lt;li>As is the case in NLP applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector using an
&lt;a href="https://medium.com/deeper-learning/glossary-of-deep-learning-word-embedding-f90c3cec34ca" rel="noopener">embedding algorithm&lt;/a>. (

&lt;li>The embedding only happens in the bottom-most encoder. The abstraction that is common to all the encoders is that they receive a list of vectors each of the size 512 – In the bottom encoder that would be the word embeddings, but in other encoders, it would be the output of the encoder that’s directly below (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43d82ec8nqmyx1ekqz4vsy" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After embedding the words in our input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder. (

&lt;li>Here we begin to see one key property of the Transformer, which is that the word in each position flows through its own path in the encoder. There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, however, and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while flowing through the feed-forward layer. (

&lt;li>an encoder receives a list of vectors as input. It processes this list by passing these vectors into a ‘self-attention’ layer, then into a feed-forward neural network, then sends out the output upwards to the next encoder. (

&lt;li>Don’t be fooled by me throwing around the word “self-attention” like it’s a concept everyone should be familiar with. I had personally never came across the concept until reading the Attention is All You Need paper. Let us distill how it works.
Say the following sentence is an input sentence we want to translate:
”&lt;code>The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired&lt;/code>”
What does “it” in this sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or to the animal? It’s a simple question to a human, but not as simple to an algorithm. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43g439emrv0ppc47107xe6" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the model is processing the word “it”, self-attention allows it to associate “it” with “animal”. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gfpbp5215vsfmma0fs0e" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As the model processes each word (each position in the input sequence), self attention allows it to look at other positions in the input sequence for clues that can help lead to a better encoding for this word. (

&lt;li>If you’re familiar with RNNs, think of how maintaining a hidden state allows an RNN to incorporate its representation of previous words/vectors it has processed with the current one it’s processing. Self-attention is the method the Transformer uses to bake the “understanding” of other relevant words into the one we’re currently processing. (

&lt;li>The &lt;strong>first step&lt;/strong> in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoder’s input vectors (in this case, the embedding of each word). So for each word, we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. These vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process. (

&lt;li>Notice that these new vectors are smaller in dimension than the embedding vector. Their dimensionality is 64, while the embedding and encoder input/output vectors have dimensionality of 512. They don’t HAVE to be smaller, this is an architecture choice to make the computation of multiheaded attention (mostly) constant. (

&lt;li>What are the “query”, “key”, and “value” vectors?
They’re abstractions that are useful for calculating and thinking about attention. Once you proceed with reading how attention is calculated below, you’ll know pretty much all you need to know about the role each of these vectors plays.
The &lt;strong>second step&lt;/strong> in calculating self-attention is to calculate a score. Say we’re calculating the self-attention for the first word in this example, “Thinking”. We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word. The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kds63qrdqsk5tw2dhknp" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The score is calculated by taking the dot product of the query vector with the key vector of the respective word we’re scoring. So if we’re processing the self-attention for the word in position #1, the first score would be the dot product of q1 and k1. The second score would be the dot product of q1 and k2. (

&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kvr3434ae2v73chyhv9e" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>third and fourth steps&lt;/strong> are to divide the scores by 8 (the square root of the dimension of the key vectors used in the paper – 64. This leads to having more stable gradients. There could be other possible values here, but this is the default), then pass the result through a softmax operation. Softmax normalizes the scores so they’re all positive and add up to 1. (

&lt;li>his softmax score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position. Clearly the word at this position will have the highest softmax score, but sometimes it’s useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the current word. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43n1q3mav0cybysjmsbkt9" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>fifth step&lt;/strong> is to multiply each value vector by the softmax score (in preparation to sum them up). The intuition here is to keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on, and drown-out irrelevant words (by multiplying them by tiny numbers like 0.001, for example) (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43natm8kn4nej6xgepqh08" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>sixth step&lt;/strong> is to sum up the weighted value vectors. This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this position (for the first word). (

&lt;li>That concludes the self-attention calculation. The resulting vector is one we can send along to the feed-forward neural network. In the actual implementation, however, this calculation is done in matrix form for faster processing. So let’s look at that now that we’ve seen the intuition of the calculation on the word level. (

&lt;li>Matrix Calculation of Self-Attention
&lt;strong>The first step&lt;/strong> is to calculate the Query, Key, and Value matrices. We do that by packing our embeddings into a matrix X, and multiplying it by the weight matrices we’ve trained (WQ, WK, WV). (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43s12mtkh4d0g4pvc8m0w5" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Finally&lt;/strong>, since we’re dealing with matrices, we can condense steps two through six in one formula to calculate the outputs of the self-attention layer.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation-2.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ssjaecxkvwnz37dejpyy" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The paper further refined the self-attention layer by adding a mechanism called “multi-headed” attention. This improves the performance of the attention layer in two ways:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>It expands the model’s ability to focus on different positions. Yes, in the example above, z1 contains a little bit of every other encoding, but it could be dominated by the actual word itself. If we’re translating a sentence like “The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired”, it would be useful to know which word “it” refers to. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43tgjwvw3dkd7fjx70q6by" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It gives the attention layer multiple “representation subspaces”. As we’ll see next, with multi-headed attention we have not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/Value weight matrices (the Transformer uses eight attention heads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder). Each of these sets is randomly initialized. Then, after training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a different representation subspace. (

&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43v18wvm97ydchy62d2fg7" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>f we do the same self-attention calculation we outlined above, just eight different times with different weight matrices, we end up with eight different Z matrices
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_z.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43v47h8vhrd36nkabghtxk" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This leaves us with a bit of a challenge. The feed-forward layer is not expecting eight matrices – it’s expecting a single matrix (a vector for each word). So we need a way to condense these eight down into a single matrix.
How do we do that? We concat the matrices then multiply them by an additional weights matrix WO.

&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43vh72mghvq1ez0345p7tn" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That’s pretty much all there is to multi-headed self-attention. It’s quite a handful of matrices, I realize. Let me try to put them all in one visual so we can look at them in one place (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43vw9h0v6s4ys2pk44e428" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>

&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43wyr08hq72r7ntkn6jya2" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now that we have touched upon attention heads, let’s revisit our example from before to see where the different attention heads are focusing as we encode the word “it” in our example sentence:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_2.png" width="auto" alt="" />
As we encode the word &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo;, one attention head is focusing most on &amp;ldquo;the animal&amp;rdquo;, while another is focusing on &amp;ldquo;tired&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; in a sense, the model&amp;rsquo;s representation of the word &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo; bakes in some of the representation of both &amp;ldquo;animal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;tired&amp;rdquo;.
If we add all the attention heads to the picture, however, things can be harder to interpret:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_3.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43yat77cam7ysnc577vh70" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One thing that’s missing from the model as we have described it so far is a way to account for the order of the words in the input sequence.
To address this, the transformer adds a vector to each input embedding. These vectors follow a specific pattern that the model learns, which helps it determine the position of each word, or the distance between different words in the sequence. The intuition here is that adding these values to the embeddings provides meaningful distances between the embedding vectors once they’re projected into Q/K/V vectors and during dot-product attention. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43yyj61gv31j0syr73xyga" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_vectors.png" width="auto" alt="" />
To give the model a sense of the order of the words, we add positional encoding vectors &amp;ndash; the values of which follow a specific pattern.
If we assumed the embedding has a dimensionality of 4, the actual positional encodings would look like this:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_example.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43znch1bsfjnb2b928qek7" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One detail in the architecture of the encoder that we need to mention before moving on, is that each sub-layer (self-attention, ffnn) in each encoder has a residual connection around it, and is followed by a
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450" rel="noopener">layer-normalization&lt;/a> step.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr440f4v2m98ewn3esstkrv8" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we’re to visualize the vectors and the layer-norm operation associated with self attention, it would look like this:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_2.png" width="auto" alt="" />
This goes for the sub-layers of the decoder as well. If we’re to think of a Transformer of 2 stacked encoders and decoders, it would look something like this:
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_3.png" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4413g6rgtjkqb5vw6brsbw" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now that we’ve covered most of the concepts on the encoder side, we basically know how the components of decoders work as well. But let’s take a look at how they work together.
The encoder start by processing the input sequence. The output of the top encoder is then transformed into a set of attention vectors K and V. These are to be used by each decoder in its “encoder-decoder attention” layer which helps the decoder focus on appropriate places in the input sequence: (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr441fp3bt80av1s3zq5df63" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_1.gif" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr441tgtwqrtp61jmjh4gr26" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The following steps repeat the process until a special symbol is reached indicating the transformer decoder has completed its output. The output of each step is fed to the bottom decoder in the next time step, and the decoders bubble up their decoding results just like the encoders did. And just like we did with the encoder inputs, we embed and add positional encoding to those decoder inputs to indicate the position of each word.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_2.gif" width="auto" alt="" /> (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4422r1a9ggxktc1bjvk6qf" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The self attention layers in the decoder operate in a slightly different way than the one in the encoder:
In the decoder, the self-attention layer is only allowed to attend to earlier positions in the output sequence. This is done by masking future positions (setting them to &lt;code>-inf&lt;/code>) before the softmax step in the self-attention calculation.
The “Encoder-Decoder Attention” layer works just like multiheaded self-attention, except it creates its Queries matrix from the layer below it, and takes the Keys and Values matrix from the output of the encoder stack. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr442gq9g1s6t401zvnszsbg" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The decoder stack outputs a vector of floats. How do we turn that into a word? That’s the job of the final Linear layer which is followed by a Softmax Layer.
The Linear layer is a simple fully connected neural network that projects the vector produced by the stack of decoders, into a much, much larger vector called a logits vector.
Let’s assume that our model knows 10,000 unique English words (our model’s “output vocabulary”) that it’s learned from its training dataset. This would make the logits vector 10,000 cells wide – each cell corresponding to the score of a unique word. That is how we interpret the output of the model followed by the Linear layer.
The softmax layer then turns those scores into probabilities (all positive, all add up to 1.0). The cell with the highest probability is chosen, and the word associated with it is produced as the output for this time step. (

&lt;li>Now that we’ve covered the entire forward-pass process through a trained Transformer, it would be useful to glance at the intuition of training the model.
During training, an untrained model would go through the exact same forward pass. But since we are training it on a labeled training dataset, we can compare its output with the actual correct output.
To visualize this, let’s assume our output vocabulary only contains six words(“a”, “am”, “i”, “thanks”, “student”, and “&lt;eos>” (short for ‘end of sentence’)). (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr443x9f8v1vp5wr32c61w5n" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/vocabulary.png" width="auto" alt="" />
The output vocabulary of our model is created in the preprocessing phase before we even begin training. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444rwtqjn4t79nrm00egbd" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once we define our output vocabulary, we can use a vector of the same width to indicate each word in our vocabulary. This also known as one-hot encoding. So for example, we can indicate the word “am” using the following vector: (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444akq9ps9fbk8fbx68zxy" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/one-hot-vocabulary-example.png" width="auto" alt="" />
Example: one-hot encoding of our output vocabulary (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444ptpa7ancdtj89zmjjd6" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Loss Function
Say we are training our model. Say it’s our first step in the training phase, and we’re training it on a simple example – translating “merci” into “thanks”.
What this means, is that we want the output to be a probability distribution indicating the word “thanks”. But since this model is not yet trained, that’s unlikely to happen just yet.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_logits_output_and_label.png" width="auto" alt="" />
Since the model&amp;rsquo;s parameters (weights) are all initialized randomly, the (untrained) model produces a probability distribution with arbitrary values for each cell/word. We can compare it with the actual output, then tweak all the model&amp;rsquo;s weights using backpropagation to make the output closer to the desired output. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr445m67n0aw8x514vrk2xb3" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But note that this is an oversimplified example. More realistically, we’ll use a sentence longer than one word. For example – input: “je suis étudiant” and expected output: “i am a student”. What this really means, is that we want our model to successively output probability distributions where:
• Each probability distribution is represented by a vector of width vocab_size (6 in our toy example, but more realistically a number like 30,000 or 50,000)
• The first probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “i”
• The second probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “am”
• And so on, until the fifth output distribution indicates ‘&lt;code>&amp;lt;end of sentence&amp;gt;&lt;/code>’ symbol, which also has a cell associated with it from the 10,000 element vocabulary.
&lt;img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/output_target_probability_distributions.png" width="auto" alt="" />
The targeted probability distributions we&amp;rsquo;ll train our model against in the training example for one sample sentence. (

Dead wrong,” he says. “Your job as vp of it Operations is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that delivers value to the business while minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure it service.” (

&lt;li>“Sensei Goldratt taught us that in most plants, there are a very small number of resources, whether it’s men, machines, or materials, that dictates the output of the entire system. We call this the constraint—or bottleneck. Either term works. Whatever you call it, until you create a trusted system to manage the flow of work to the constraint, the constraint is constantly wasted, which means that the constraint is likely being drastically underutilized.

&lt;li>“That means you’re not delivering to the business the full capacity available to you. It also likely means that you’re not paying down technical debt, so your problems and amount of unplanned work continues to increase over time,” he says. He continues, “You’ve identified this Brent person as a constraint to restore service. Trust me, you’ll find that he constrains many other important flows of work, as well.” (

&lt;li>“There are five focusing steps which Sensei Goldratt describes in The Goal: Step 1 is to identify the constraint. You’ve done that, so congratulations. Keep challenging yourself to really make sure that’s your organizational constraint, because if you’re wrong, nothing you do will matter. Remember, any improvement not made at the constraint is just an illusion, yes? (

&lt;li>“Step 2 is to exploit the constraint,” he continues. “In other words, make sure that the constraint is not allowed to waste any time. Ever. It should never be waiting on any other resource for anything, and it should always be working on the highest priority commitment the it Operations organization has made to the rest of the enterprise. Always.” I hear him say encouragingly, “You’ve done a good job exploiting the constraint on several fronts. (

&lt;li>unplanned work kills your ability to do planned work, so you must always do whatever it takes to eradicate it. (

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Step 3, which is to subordinate the constraint. In the Theory of Constraints, this is typically implemented by something called Drum-Buffer-Rope. In The Goal, the main character, Alex, learns about this when he discovers that Herbie, the slowest Boy Scout in the troop, actually dictates the entire group’s marching pace. Alex moved Herbie to the front of the line to prevent kids from going on too far ahead. Later at Alex’s plant, he started to release all work in accordance to the rate it could be consumed by the heat treat ovens, which was his plant’s bottleneck. That was his real-life Herbie.” (

&lt;li>Remember, it goes beyond reducing wip. Being able to take needless work out of the system is more important than being able to put more work into the system. (

&lt;li>Whether we are a John, a Brent, a Wes, a Patty, or a Bill, when we’re trapped in a system that prevents us from succeeding, our job becomes thankless, reinforces a feeling of powerlessness, and we feel like we are trapped in a system that preordains failure. And worse, the nature of technical debt that is not paid down ensures that the system gets worse over time, regardless of how hard we try. (

&lt;li>The mission at hand is how we can elevate their productivity so that they’re as productive as the high performers. We know through more than four years of State of DevOps Reports conducted by Puppet that high perfomers are two to three orders of magnitude more productive than their peers. In my mind, helping everyone reach this level of high performace will create trillions of dollars of economic value per year and is where the next surge of productivity will come from. (

&lt;li>“If you think it Operations has nothing to learn from Plant Operations, you’re wrong. Dead wrong,” he says. “Your job as vp of it Operations is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that delivers value to the business while minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure it service.” (

&lt;li>“Sensei Goldratt taught us that in most plants, there are a very small number of resources, whether it’s men, machines, or materials, that dictates the output of the entire system. We call this the constraint—or bottleneck. Either term works. Whatever you call it, until you create a trusted system to manage the flow of work to the constraint, the constraint is constantly wasted, which means that the constraint is likely being drastically underutilized. (

&lt;li>“That means you’re not delivering to the business the full capacity available to you. It also likely means that you’re not paying down technical debt, so your problems and amount of unplanned work continues to increase over time,” he says. He continues, “You’ve identified this Brent person as a constraint to restore service. Trust me, you’ll find that he constrains many other important flows of work, as well.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078Y98RG8&amp;amp;location=2608" rel="noopener">Location 2608&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“There are five focusing steps which Sensei Goldratt describes in The Goal: Step 1 is to identify the constraint. You’ve done that, so congratulations. Keep challenging yourself to really make sure that’s your organizational constraint, because if you’re wrong, nothing you do will matter. Remember, any improvement not made at the constraint is just an illusion, yes? (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078Y98RG8&amp;amp;location=2612" rel="noopener">Location 2612&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Step 2 is to exploit the constraint,” he continues. “In other words, make sure that the constraint is not allowed to waste any time. Ever. It should never be waiting on any other resource for anything, and it should always be working on the highest priority commitment the it Operations organization has made to the rest of the enterprise. Always.” I hear him say encouragingly, “You’ve done a good job exploiting the constraint on several fronts. (

&lt;li>unplanned work kills your ability to do planned work, so you must always do whatever it takes to eradicate it. (

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Step 3, which is to subordinate the constraint. In the Theory of Constraints, this is typically implemented by something called Drum-Buffer-Rope. In The Goal, the main character, Alex, learns about this when he discovers that Herbie, the slowest Boy Scout in the troop, actually dictates the entire group’s marching pace. Alex moved Herbie to the front of the line to prevent kids from going on too far ahead. Later at Alex’s plant, he started to release all work in accordance to the rate it could be consumed by the heat treat ovens, which was his plant’s bottleneck. That was his real-life Herbie.” (

&lt;li>Remember, it goes beyond reducing wip. Being able to take needless work out of the system is more important than being able to put more work into the system. (

&lt;li>“If you think it Operations has nothing to learn from Plant Operations, you’re wrong. Dead wrong,” he says. “Your job as vp of it Operations is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that delivers value to the business while minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure it service.” (

&lt;li>The Goal by Dr. Eli Goldratt. (

&lt;li>“Sensei Goldratt taught us that in most plants, there are a very small number of resources, whether it’s men, machines, or materials, that dictates the output of the entire system. We call this the constraint—or bottleneck. Either term works. Whatever you call it, until you create a trusted system to manage the flow of work to the constraint, the constraint is constantly wasted, which means that the constraint is likely being drastically underutilized. (

&lt;li>“That means you’re not delivering to the business the full capacity available to you. It also likely means that you’re not paying down technical debt, so your problems and amount of unplanned work continues to increase over time,” he says. He continues, “You’ve identified this Brent person as a constraint to restore service. Trust me, you’ll find that he constrains many other important flows of work, as well.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078Y98RG8&amp;amp;location=2608" rel="noopener">Location 2608&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“There are five focusing steps which Sensei Goldratt describes in The Goal: Step 1 is to identify the constraint. You’ve done that, so congratulations. Keep challenging yourself to really make sure that’s your organizational constraint, because if you’re wrong, nothing you do will matter. Remember, any improvement not made at the constraint is just an illusion, yes? (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078Y98RG8&amp;amp;location=2612" rel="noopener">Location 2612&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Step 2 is to exploit the constraint,” he continues. “In other words, make sure that the constraint is not allowed to waste any time. Ever. It should never be waiting on any other resource for anything, and it should always be working on the highest priority commitment the it Operations organization has made to the rest of the enterprise. Always.” I hear him say encouragingly, “You’ve done a good job exploiting the constraint on several fronts. (

&lt;li>unplanned work kills your ability to do planned work, so you must always do whatever it takes to eradicate it. (

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Step 3, which is to subordinate the constraint. In the Theory of Constraints, this is typically implemented by something called Drum-Buffer-Rope. In The Goal, the main character, Alex, learns about this when he discovers that Herbie, the slowest Boy Scout in the troop, actually dictates the entire group’s marching pace. Alex moved Herbie to the front of the line to prevent kids from going on too far ahead. Later at Alex’s plant, he started to release all work in accordance to the rate it could be consumed by the heat treat ovens, which was his plant’s bottleneck. That was his real-life Herbie.” (

&lt;li>Remember, it goes beyond reducing wip. Being able to take needless work out of the system is more important than being able to put more work into the system. (

&lt;li>‘technical debt’ that is not being paid down. It comes from taking shortcuts, which may make sense in the short-term. But like financial debt, the compounding interest costs grow over time. If an organization doesn’t pay down its technical debt, every calorie in the organization can be spent just paying interest, in the form of unplanned work.” “As (

&lt;li>‘Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work.’ The Third Way is all about ensuring that we’re continually putting tension into the system, so that we’re continually reinforcing habits and improving something. Resilience engineering tells us that we should routinely inject faults into the system, doing them frequently, to make them less painful. (

&lt;li>“As part of the First Way, you must gain a true understanding of the business system that it operates in. W. Edwards Deming called this ‘appreciation for the system.’ When it comes to it, you face two difficulties: On the one hand, in Dick’s second slide, you now see that there are organizational commitments that it is responsible for helping uphold and protect that no one has verbalized precisely yet. On the other hand, John has discovered that some it controls he holds near and dear aren’t needed, because other parts of the organization are adequately mitigating those risks. (

&lt;li>manufacturing plant is a system. The raw materials start on one side, and a million things need to go just right in order for it to leave as finished goods as scheduled out the other side. Everything works together. If any work center is warring with the other work centers, especially if Manufacturing is at war with Engineering, every inch of progress will be a struggle.” (

&lt;li>“You’ve got to stop thinking like a work center supervisor. You need to think bigger, like a plant manager. Or better yet, think like the person who designed this manufacturing plant and all of the processes it relies upon. They look at the entire flow of work, identify where the constraints are, and use every possible technology and bit of process knowledge they have to ensure work is performed effectively and efficiently. They harness their ‘inner-Allspaw.’” (

&lt;li>Dev and Ops working together, along with qa and the business, are a super-tribe that can achieve amazing things. They also knew that until code is in production, no value is actually being generated, because it’s merely wip stuck in the system. He kept reducing the batch size, enabling fast feature flow. In part, he did this by ensuring environments were always available when they were needed. He automated the build and deployment process, recognizing that infrastructure could be treated as code, just like the application that Development ships. That enabled him to create a one-step environment creation and deploy procedure, just like we figured out a way to do one-step painting and curing. (

&lt;li>“If you think it Operations has nothing to learn from Plant Operations, you’re wrong. Dead wrong,” he says. “Your job as vp of it Operations is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that delivers value to the business while minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure it service.” (

&lt;li>The Goal by Dr. Eli Goldratt. (

&lt;li>“Sensei Goldratt taught us that in most plants, there are a very small number of resources, whether it’s men, machines, or materials, that dictates the output of the entire system. We call this the constraint—or bottleneck. Either term works. Whatever you call it, until you create a trusted system to manage the flow of work to the constraint, the constraint is constantly wasted, which means that the constraint is likely being drastically underutilized. (

&lt;li>“That means you’re not delivering to the business the full capacity available to you. It also likely means that you’re not paying down technical debt, so your problems and amount of unplanned work continues to increase over time,” he says. He continues, “You’ve identified this Brent person as a constraint to restore service. Trust me, you’ll find that he constrains many other important flows of work, as well.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078Y98RG8&amp;amp;location=2608" rel="noopener">Location 2608&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“There are five focusing steps which Sensei Goldratt describes in The Goal: Step 1 is to identify the constraint. You’ve done that, so congratulations. Keep challenging yourself to really make sure that’s your organizational constraint, because if you’re wrong, nothing you do will matter. Remember, any improvement not made at the constraint is just an illusion, yes? (

&lt;li>“Step 2 is to exploit the constraint,” he continues. “In other words, make sure that the constraint is not allowed to waste any time. Ever. It should never be waiting on any other resource for anything, and it should always be working on the highest priority commitment the it Operations organization has made to the rest of the enterprise. Always.” I hear him say encouragingly, “You’ve done a good job exploiting the constraint on several fronts. (

&lt;li>unplanned work kills your ability to do planned work, so you must always do whatever it takes to eradicate it. (

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Step 3, which is to subordinate the constraint. In the Theory of Constraints, this is typically implemented by something called Drum-Buffer-Rope. In The Goal, the main character, Alex, learns about this when he discovers that Herbie, the slowest Boy Scout in the troop, actually dictates the entire group’s marching pace. Alex moved Herbie to the front of the line to prevent kids from going on too far ahead. Later at Alex’s plant, he started to release all work in accordance to the rate it could be consumed by the heat treat ovens, which was his plant’s bottleneck. That was his real-life Herbie.” (

&lt;li>Remember, it goes beyond reducing wip. Being able to take needless work out of the system is more important than being able to put more work into the system. (

&lt;li>outcomes are what matter—not the process, not controls, or, for that matter, what work you complete.” (

&lt;li>great team doesn’t mean that they had the smartest people. What made those teams great is that everyone trusted one another. It can be a powerful thing when that magic dynamic exists. (

&lt;li>‘technical debt’ that is not being paid down. It comes from taking shortcuts, which may make sense in the short-term. But like financial debt, the compounding interest costs grow over time. If an organization doesn’t pay down its technical debt, every calorie in the organization can be spent just paying interest, in the form of unplanned work.” “As (

&lt;li>‘Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work.’ The Third Way is all about ensuring that we’re continually putting tension into the system, so that we’re continually reinforcing habits and improving something. Resilience engineering tells us that we should routinely inject faults into the system, doing them frequently, to make them less painful. (

&lt;li>the purple cards are the changes supporting one of the top five business projects, otherwise, they’re yellow. The green cards are for internal it improvement projects, and we’re experimenting with allocating twenty percent of our cycles just for those, (

&lt;li>“As part of the First Way, you must gain a true understanding of the business system that it operates in. W. Edwards Deming called this ‘appreciation for the system.’ When it comes to it, you face two difficulties: On the one hand, in Dick’s second slide, you now see that there are organizational commitments that it is responsible for helping uphold and protect that no one has verbalized precisely yet. On the other hand, John has discovered that some it controls he holds near and dear aren’t needed, because other parts of the organization are adequately mitigating those risks. (

&lt;li>We can outsource the work but not the responsibility.” (

&lt;li>It seems to me that if anyone is managing it without talking about the Three Ways, they are managing it on dangerously faulty assumptions. (

&lt;li>manufacturing plant is a system. The raw materials start on one side, and a million things need to go just right in order for it to leave as finished goods as scheduled out the other side. Everything works together. If any work center is warring with the other work centers, especially if Manufacturing is at war with Engineering, every inch of progress will be a struggle.” (

&lt;li>“You’ve got to stop thinking like a work center supervisor. You need to think bigger, like a plant manager. Or better yet, think like the person who designed this manufacturing plant and all of the processes it relies upon. They look at the entire flow of work, identify where the constraints are, and use every possible technology and bit of process knowledge they have to ensure work is performed effectively and efficiently. They harness their ‘inner-Allspaw.’” (

&lt;li>Dev and Ops working together, along with qa and the business, are a super-tribe that can achieve amazing things. They also knew that until code is in production, no value is actually being generated, because it’s merely wip stuck in the system. He kept reducing the batch size, enabling fast feature flow. In part, he did this by ensuring environments were always available when they were needed. He automated the build and deployment process, recognizing that infrastructure could be treated as code, just like the application that Development ships. That enabled him to create a one-step environment creation and deploy procedure, just like we figured out a way to do one-step painting and curing. (

&lt;li>deployment pipeline. That’s your entire value stream from code check-in to production. That’s not an art. That’s production. You need to get everything in version control. Everything. Not just the code, but everything required to build the environment. (

&lt;li>“You’ve helped me see that it is not merely a department. Instead, it’s pervasive, like electricity. It’s a skill, like being able to read or do math. Here at Parts Unlimited, we don’t have a centralized reading or math department—we expect everyone we hire to have some mastery of it. Understanding what technology can and can’t do has become a core competency that every part of this business must have. (

&lt;li>If any of my business managers are leading a team or a project without that skill, they will fail.” (

&lt;li>Whether we are a John, a Brent, a Wes, a Patty, or a Bill, when we’re trapped in a system that prevents us from succeeding, our job becomes thankless, reinforces a feeling of powerlessness, and we feel like we are trapped in a system that preordains failure. And worse, the nature of technical debt that is not paid down ensures that the system gets worse over time, regardless of how hard we try. (

&lt;li>The mission at hand is how we can elevate their productivity so that they’re as productive as the high performers. We know through more than four years of State of DevOps Reports conducted by Puppet that high perfomers are two to three orders of magnitude more productive than their peers. In my mind, helping everyone reach this level of high performace will create trillions of dollars of economic value per year and is where the next surge of productivity will come from. (

An amateur would lie awake all night, starting at every noise, making up sounds when there aren’t any. He’s hunted enough guys to know that their own heads can be their worst enemies. They start seeing things that aren’t there, then, worse, not seeing things that are. They worry and worry, and chew on their own insides, until, when you do track them down, they’re almost grateful.

&lt;li>Meetings are a symptom of broken process. We use meetings as a crutch, a fallback. When we don’t know how to get work done, or we’re not willing to invest in a process that will actually advance the goal, we schedule meetings. (

&lt;li>Our seat at the table starts to matter more than getting something done when we’re sitting there. (

&lt;li>I said no to meetings that I thought I didn’t need to be at, or which I thought would be a waste of time. I killed all the meetings I thought I was attending for status reasons (

&lt;li>Removing meetings wasn’t disconnecting, it was the beginning of treating the underlying disease. I had time to think, design, and contribute more. I had time to unblock people who needed me. I was still in meetings over half of the time, but I was more focused and prepared in the meetings that remained. And I was able to spend more time connecting. (

&lt;li>Great process is lightweight, efficient, and adaptable. Too much is bad but not enough is worse. You need things like clear planning processes and well organized product development and design process that include all functions. And you need program managers (PgM, DpM, TpM, OMGpM) whose major job is to take care of this stuff. A great program manager can measure their worth in meetings removed. (

&lt;li>Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs56zjwr4x67myv3mm7x66k9" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we show that
LMs can teach themselves to use external tools
via simple APIs (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs55kwd9kr4vas1cdfwhs26p" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Toolformer, a model
trained to decide which APIs to call, when to
call them, what arguments to pass, and how to
best incorporate the results into future token
prediction. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs55m3606zentxqprj1gp7b9" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>. This is done in a self-supervised
way, requiring nothing more than a handful of
demonstrations for each API. We incorporate
a range of tools, including a calculator, a Q&amp;amp;A
system, a search engine, a translation system,
and a calendar. Toolformer achieves substan-
tially improved zero-shot performance across
a variety of downstream tasks, often competi-
tive with much larger models, without sacriﬁc-
ing its core language modeling abilities. (

&lt;li>, existing ap-
proaches either rely on large amounts of human
annotations (Komeili et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al.,
2022) or limit tool use to task-speciﬁc settings only
(e.g., Gao et al., 2022; Parisi et al., 2022), (

facts ( (

&lt;li>difﬁcul-
ties in understanding low-resource languages (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs55ndxva4tqsbw3e9qt4b5y" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a lack of mathematical skills to per-
form precise calculations (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs55ngp7a4x9j123mfx7h8rt" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>) and an
unawareness of the progression of time (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs55nk10e7szqrk6ybnmzfbk" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The use of tools should be learned in a
self-supervised way without requiring large
amounts of human annotations. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs55qqchkt3x8ygg1xj5r9p4" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The LM should not lose any of its generality
and should be able to decide for itself when
and how to use which tool. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs55qz0f2332adm14jdjtmq2" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our aim is to equip a language model M with the
ability to use different tools by means of API calls.
We require that inputs and outputs for each API
can be represented as text sequences. This allows
seamless insertion of API calls into any given text,
using special tokens to mark the start and end of
each such call. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs56404drd4dzfjjj903bs74" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>using large LMs with in-
context learning (Brown et al., 2020) to generate
entire datasets from scratch (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5627sh3h78gknv00rwshbc" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Given just a handful of human-written examples
of how an API can be used, we let a LM annotate
a huge language modeling dataset with potential
API calls. We then use a self-supervised loss to
determine which of these API calls actually help
the model in predicting future tokens. Finally, we
ﬁnetune the LM itself on the API calls that it con-
siders useful. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs562vsakc7e6gm4tkvz0mh2" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As a next step, we execute
all API calls generated by M to obtain the corre-
sponding results. How this is done depends entirely
on the API itself – for example, it can involve call-
ing another neural network, executing a Python
script or using a retrieval system to perform search
over a large corpus (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5651fp2zbjy5s11ykxtfxy" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For each API, we write a
prompt P(x) that encourages the LM to anno-
tate an example x = x1, . . . , xn with API calls. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs564marcfgazs5b5j98hch2" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Model Finetuning After sampling and ﬁltering
calls for all APIs, we ﬁnally merge the remaining
API calls and interleave them with the original
inputs (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs565q74k49z4vr8xkm484jt" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One such limi-
tation is the inability of Toolformer to use tools in a
chain (i.e., using the output of one tool as an input
for another tool). This is due to the fact that API
calls for each tool are generated independently; as a
consequence, there are no examples of chained tool
use in the ﬁnetuning dataset (

trained with Toolformer to often be sensitive to the
exact wording of their input when deciding whether

call them, what arguments to pass, and how to

&lt;li>. This is done in a self-supervised
way, requiring nothing more than a handful of
demonstrations for each API. We incorporate
a range of tools, including a calculator, a Q&amp;amp;A
system, a search engine, a translation system,

tially improved zero-shot performance across
a variety of downstream tasks, often competi-
tive with much larger models, without sacriﬁc-
ing its core language modeling abilities. (

&lt;li>The use of tools should be learned in a
self-supervised way without requiring large
amounts of human annotations. (

&lt;li>The LM should not lose any of its generality
and should be able to decide for itself when
and how to use which tool. (

&lt;li>Our aim is to equip a language model M with the
ability to use different tools by means of API calls.
We require that inputs and outputs for each API
can be represented as text sequences. This allows
seamless insertion of API calls into any given text,
using special tokens to mark the start and end of
each such call. (

&lt;li>using large LMs with in-
context learning (Brown et al., 2020) to generate
entire datasets from scratch (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5627sh3h78gknv00rwshbc" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Given just a handful of human-written examples
of how an API can be used, we let a LM annotate
a huge language modeling dataset with potential
API calls. We then use a self-supervised loss to
determine which of these API calls actually help
the model in predicting future tokens. Finally, we
ﬁnetune the LM itself on the API calls that it con-
siders useful. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs562vsakc7e6gm4tkvz0mh2" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As a next step, we execute
all API calls generated by M to obtain the corre-
sponding results. How this is done depends entirely
on the API itself – for example, it can involve call-
ing another neural network, executing a Python
script or using a retrieval system to perform search
over a large corpus (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5651fp2zbjy5s11ykxtfxy" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For each API, we write a
prompt P(x) that encourages the LM to anno-
tate an example x = x1, . . . , xn with API calls. (

&lt;li>Model Finetuning After sampling and ﬁltering
calls for all APIs, we ﬁnally merge the remaining
API calls and interleave them with the original
inputs (

&lt;a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/encoder-decoder-long-short-term-memory-networks/" rel="noopener">encoder-decoder models&lt;/a> that had become popular just over the 2–3 years prior. Up until that point however, attention was just one of the mechanisms used by these models, which were mostly based on LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) and other RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) variations. The key insight of the Transformers paper was that, as the title implies, attention could be used as the only mechanism to derive dependencies between input and output. (

&lt;li>A generic encoder/decoder architecture is made up of two models. The encoder takes the input and encodes it into a fixed-length vector. The decoder takes that vector and decodes it into the output sequence. The encoder and decoder are jointly trained to minimize the conditional log-likelihood. Once trained the encoder/decoder can generate an output given an input sequence or can score a pair of input/output sequences. (

&lt;li>n the case of the original Transformer architecture, both encoder and decoder had 6 identical layers. In each of those 6 layers the Encoder has two sub layers: a multi-head attention layer, and a simple feed forward network. Each sublayer has a residual connection and a layer normalization. The output size of the Encoder is 512. The Decoder adds a third sublayer, which is another multi-head attention layer over the output of the Encoder. Besides, the other multi-head layer in the decoder is masked to prevent attention to subsequent positions. (

&lt;li>Sequence-to-sequence models are deep learning models that have achieved a lot of success in tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3nv5vttyncanrptep48jnz" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A sequence-to-sequence model is a model that takes a sequence of items (words, letters, features of an images…etc) and outputs another sequence of items. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3njgkdgd6y9frntw9jxhf1" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Under the hood, the model is composed of an encoder and a decoder.
The encoder processes each item in the input sequence, it compiles the information it captures into a vector (called the context). After processing the entire input sequence, the encoder sends the context over to the decoder, which begins producing the output sequence item by item. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3nm5vg4dnv831j7dqytxrw" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The context is a vector (an array of numbers, basically) in the case of machine translation. The encoder and decoder tend to both be recurrent neural networks (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3nmy39nha0ggw7mnkf0pa5" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can set the size of the context vector when you set up your model. It is basically the number of hidden units in the encoder RNN. These visualizations show a vector of size 4, but in real world applications the context vector would be of a size like 256, 512, or 1024. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3nnhctxxw7npj11y72x88w" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RNN takes two inputs at each time step: an input (in the case of the encoder, one word from the input sentence), and a hidden state. The word, however, needs to be represented by a vector. To transform a word into a vector, we turn to the class of methods called “
&lt;a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-word-embeddings/" rel="noopener">word embedding&lt;/a>” algorithms. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3nphycgsrkr71be5r59p9a" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The next RNN step takes the second input vector and hidden state #1 to create the output of that time step. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3pdrygrfvtjz0eh0ysd8q7" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>each pulse for the encoder or decoder is that RNN processing its inputs and generating an output for that time step. Since the encoder and decoder are both RNNs, each time step one of the RNNs does some processing, it updates its hidden state based on its inputs and previous inputs it has seen (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3pgaqdtpdzq394war17qy2" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Notice how the last hidden state is actually the context we pass along to the decoder. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3pgh3tjyzyyttfv3gzbdkh" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The decoder also maintains a hidden state that it passes from one time step to the next (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3ph1qrd5mfrcgxf931r1n1" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The context vector turned out to be a bottleneck for these types of models. It made it challenging for the models to deal with long sentences. A solution was proposed in
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473" rel="noopener">Bahdanau et al., 2014&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025" rel="noopener">Luong et al., 2015&lt;/a>. These papers introduced and refined a technique called “Attention”, which highly improved the quality of machine translation systems. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3pjqrvpfw11cff1zanafyg" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>A sequence-to-sequence model is a model that takes a sequence of items (words, letters, features of an images…etc) and outputs another sequence of items. (

&lt;li>Under the hood, the model is composed of an encoder and a decoder.
The encoder processes each item in the input sequence, it compiles the information it captures into a vector (called the context). After processing the entire input sequence, the encoder sends the context over to the decoder, which begins producing the output sequence item by item. (

&lt;li>The context is a vector (an array of numbers, basically) in the case of machine translation. The encoder and decoder tend to both be recurrent neural networks (

&lt;li>You can set the size of the context vector when you set up your model. It is basically the number of hidden units in the encoder RNN. These visualizations show a vector of size 4, but in real world applications the context vector would be of a size like 256, 512, or 1024. (

&lt;li>RNN takes two inputs at each time step: an input (in the case of the encoder, one word from the input sentence), and a hidden state. The word, however, needs to be represented by a vector. To transform a word into a vector, we turn to the class of methods called “
&lt;a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-word-embeddings/" rel="noopener">word embedding&lt;/a>” algorithms. (

&lt;li>each pulse for the encoder or decoder is that RNN processing its inputs and generating an output for that time step. Since the encoder and decoder are both RNNs, each time step one of the RNNs does some processing, it updates its hidden state based on its inputs and previous inputs it has seen (

&lt;li>Put meetings in your phone’s calendar (be detailed about who you’re meeting, where, and why) and make sure alerts are turned on, set reminders, and take photos of events to refer to later. “Go back to those pictures,” Ranganath says. Don’t just take a photo and let it languish in your camera roll forever. “Anything you can do to revisit unique moments will bring back all sorts of other stuff.” (

&lt;li>Dellis assigns vivid images to whatever he’s trying to remember, be it a number or an address. Maybe if you don’t want to forget to grab cheese at the grocery store, imagine a giant, incredibly stinky hunk of fromage. Dellis will sometimes pinch himself or say a unique mantra when putting down his keys so he’ll remember the bizarre thing he did in the moment. (

&lt;li>But if you study or reflect on things you want to remember, the more likely these memories will be strengthened, Schacter says. Again, looking at images or videos you took from a particularly enjoyable dinner with friends is a way to better commit these events to memory. (

&lt;li>Dellis recommends spending five minutes before bed recalling what happened that day. Did you see a beautiful sunset? Did your kid have a funny retort to a simple question? Did you eat something delicious? Replay small but lovely occurrences you’d like to savor. “The more you do that, over time you realize you’ll actually be able to remember more details of your life (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>An assignment of words to numbers is called a &lt;em>word embedding&lt;/em>. We can think of a word embedding as an assignment of &lt;em>scores&lt;/em> to the words, with some nice properties ( (

&lt;li>And what are the numbers we are assigning to each word? Simply the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the location of the word (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqw7306pcef7dadk7jwa10v" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>properties that a nice word embedding should have:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Words that are similar should correspond to points that are close by (or equivalently, to scores that are similar).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Words that are different should correspond to points that are far away (or equivalently, to scores that are significantly different). (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqw7p89nvv67b5nsv09ttz7" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is something more to these word embeddings, and it is that they don’t only capture word similarity, but they also capture other properties of the language. In language, words can be combined to get more complicated concepts. In mathematics, numbers can be added or subtracted to get other numbers. Could we build a word embedding that captures relations between words, as relations between numbers? (

&lt;li>The analogy “A puppy is to a dog like a calf is to a cow” can be translated into “The path from the word puppy to the word dog is the same as the path from the word calf to the word cow”. The analogy “A dog is to a cow like a puppy is to a calf” is also captured in this rectangle (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqwj85kpr6s0maystb7j6tg" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The main property of word embeddings that is in effect here is that the two axes (vertical and horizontal) represent different things. If you look carefully, moving towards the right turns the puppy into a dog, and the calf into a cow, which is an increase in &lt;em>age&lt;/em>. Likewise, moving upwards turns a puppy into a calf and a dog into a cow, which is an increase in the &lt;em>size&lt;/em> of the animal. It seems that this embedding is understanding that the words in it have two main properties, or features: age and size. Furthermore, it seems that the embedding is locating age in the horizontal axis and size in the vertical axis. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqwqne86n0epfjcz2srzky4" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>good word embedding would be able to capture not only age and size, but also many more features of the words. Since each feature is one new axis, or coordinate, then a good embedding must have many more than two coordinates assigned to every word. The cohere embedding, for example, has 4096 coordinates associated with each word. (

&lt;li>. A sentence embedding is just like a word embedding, except it associates every sentence with a vector full of numbers, in a coherent way. By coherent, I mean that it satisfies similar properties as a word embedding. For instance, similar sentences are assigned to similar vectors, different sentences are assigned to different vectors, and most importantly, each of the coordinates of the vector identifies some (whether clear or obscure) property of the sentence.

&lt;li>An assignment of words to numbers is called a &lt;em>word embedding&lt;/em>. We can think of a word embedding as an assignment of &lt;em>scores&lt;/em> to the words, with some nice properties ( (

&lt;li>properties that a nice word embedding should have:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Words that are similar should correspond to points that are close by (or equivalently, to scores that are similar).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Words that are different should correspond to points that are far away (or equivalently, to scores that are significantly different). (

&lt;li>First, Draw The Map To The Destination (One-Pager)
The map covers the intent, desired outcome, deliverable, and constraints. (

&lt;li>Intent (Why?)
What’s the problem we’re trying to solve, or the opportunity we want to gain from? How will customers benefit? &lt;em>Why&lt;/em> are we doing this, and &lt;em>why&lt;/em> is it important? (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqv4a4pvrf9vxa699rqhprg" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>

&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqv4hdmekgf30nmbb39a6m6" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But, by taking the time to think through the problem and intent, we might realise that, hey, maybe we don’t need to fix it after all. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqv4x33hv6db37nkwd2ctrs" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now that we have the intent, we can discuss how success looks like. How well should we solve this problem? How do we measure it? In data science, this is usually a business metric such as conversion, savings from fraud reduction, net promoter score, etc. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqv5gr6134s6j3wjeb0st5x" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Specifying the desired outcome, in quantifiable terms, prevents us from falling into the trap of chasing a moving target. (

&lt;li>Solving a problem to 95% could take 3-4x the effort of solving to 90%; solving to 99% might take 10-100x more. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqv6pmnpzyvbvc1wvt9zdc5" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we can design a deliverable that meets the intent and desired outcome. How should we solve this problem? The solution should be designed to meet the intent and desired outcome, keeping in mind the need to integrate with the existing system. (

&lt;li>e-commerce platform has the intent of improving how customers discover and purchase products. To achieve this, should we improve search? Or recommendations? Or email campaigns? If it’s a recommender, how will we deploy it? (

&lt;li>This doesn’t have to be especially detailed; for now, we don’t need the full architecture and specs. But it’s useful to have a rough sketch to get upfront buy-in from the business, product, and tech teams (

&lt;li>How &lt;em>not&lt;/em> to solve a problem is often more important than how to solve it. Unfortunately, this doesn’t get addressed enough. (

&lt;li>Providing teams with boundaries and constraints counterintuitively leads to greater creativity and freedom. Without constraints, we don’t know what we cannot do. (

&lt;li>“Constraints drive innovation and force focus. Instead of trying to remove them, use them to your advantage.” (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqvfbjwzcf77wk1chc642ar" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We write the intent, desired outcome, deliverable, and constraints in simple language on a single-paged document. This can be shared to stakeholders for their review, feedback, and buy-in. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqvfna7vqsse7bg262jjs8h" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This requires a certain amount of discipline from stakeholders. After all, the work comes at no cost to them. There’s nothing stopping them from changing their minds halfway through the project. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqvg2g9rhn16e9n4vnqdyey" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most projects start with a solution, then come up with estimates for each component and the overall design. (

&lt;li>I tend to do the opposite. Given a budget (read: time-box), how can we design a solution that fits? The intent and desired outcome determine the time-box, and the time-box determines the solution design. This is how Basecamp does it too—they have different
&lt;a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.5-chapter-06#ingredient-2-appetite" rel="noopener">appetite&lt;/a> for various problems, and scope the solutions accordingly. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqvkhd2w3teftgc6y5hhsf6" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The time-box will vary across the project stages. At the start, when we’re still exploring and uncertainty is high, we’ll want tighter time-boxes to limit wild goose chases. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqvmh5wgk8zff8p1zy3c46a" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>feasibility assessment&lt;/strong>. With our existing data and technology, are we able to solve the problem? If so, to what extent? In this stage, we aim for a quick and dirty investigation. I usually time-box this at 1-2 weeks. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqvmypq0e71g7khczbc0tb3" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After determining feasibility, we proceed with a &lt;strong>proof of concept&lt;/strong> (POC). In this stage, we &lt;em>hack&lt;/em> together a prototype to assess if our solution is technically achievable. Ideally, we also test the integration points with upstream data providers and downstream consumers. Can we meet the technical constraints (e.g., latency, throughput)? Is model performance satisfactory? This usually takes a month or two. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqvq07vrkf3f5gbdgy0bcs0" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We’ll want to time-box this too. An overly generous timeline can lead to non-essential features being squeezed in and never-ending development—without actually deploying it, no one benefits from it. This usually takes 3-6 months, including infra, job orchestration, testing, monitoring, documentation, etc. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqvqfe9tqzqgsaphad7mssf" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Having the one-pager and time-box improves a project’s chances of success. Usually, it’s sufficient. Nonetheless, it can be helpful to &lt;strong>break it down&lt;/strong>, especially if it involves unfamiliar data or technology. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqw13n8btrm10ddeegqt3fk" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the breakdown indicates which components are harder to implement or more at risk—these usually involve things we’ve not done before. We want to front-load the &lt;em>risk&lt;/em> and start with these &lt;em>scary&lt;/em> bits first (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqw1pce7bm7metr0z6eh1m4" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When breaking it down, I often consult seniors with more expertise and experience. They usually have better intuition on potential gotchas and blockers that deserve more attention. (

&lt;li>First, Draw The Map To The Destination (One-Pager)
The map covers the intent, desired outcome, deliverable, and constraints. (

&lt;li>Intent (Why?)
What’s the problem we’re trying to solve, or the opportunity we want to gain from? How will customers benefit? &lt;em>Why&lt;/em> are we doing this, and &lt;em>why&lt;/em> is it important? (

&lt;li>Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.” - Peter Drucker (

&lt;li>But, by taking the time to think through the problem and intent, we might realise that, hey, maybe we don’t need to fix it after all. (
&lt;a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqv4x33hv6db37nkwd2ctrs" rel="noopener">View Highlight&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now that we have the intent, we can discuss how success looks like. How well should we solve this problem? How do we measure it? In data science, this is usually a business metric such as conversion, savings from fraud reduction, net promoter score, etc. (

&lt;li>Specifying the desired outcome, in quantifiable terms, prevents us from falling into the trap of chasing a moving target. (

&lt;li>Solving a problem to 95% could take 3-4x the effort of solving to 90%; solving to 99% might take 10-100x more. (

&lt;li>we can design a deliverable that meets the intent and desired outcome. How should we solve this problem? The solution should be designed to meet the intent and desired outcome, keeping in mind the need to integrate with the existing system. (

&lt;li>e-commerce platform has the intent of improving how customers discover and purchase products. To achieve this, should we improve search? Or recommendations? Or email campaigns? If it’s a recommender, how will we deploy it? (

A decade later there is still debate on what the Data Scientist term means. The important part of the role is the science aspect.
There is no data science without data engineering and data infrastructure. There is no gain without planning and investing.
Many data scientists has to build the infrastructure and tools themselves when it does not exist.
ETL work and data quality tasks that validates the data pipeline is also part of the work of a scientist. It is even positive because it makes you learn data appreciation.
Data science integration with product managers is still not consistently integrated. Those PMs able to get the learning expertise of the Data Science teams will have a superpower.&lt;/li>

A decade later there is still debate on what the Data Scientist term means. The important part of the role is the science aspect.
There is no data science without data engineering and data infrastructure. There is no gain without planning and investing.
Many data scientists has to build the infrastructure and tools themselves when it does not exist.
ETL work and data quality tasks that validates the data pipeline is also part of the work of a scientist. It is even positive because it makes you learn data appreciation.
Data science integration with product managers is still not consistently integrated. Those PMs able to get the learning expertise of the Data Science teams will have a superpower.&lt;/li>

Wolfram|Alpha as the Way to Bring Computational Knowledge Superpowers to ChatGPT

&lt;li>For decades there’s been a dichotomy in thinking about AI between “statistical approaches” of the kind ChatGPT uses, and “symbolic approaches” that are in effect the starting point for Wolfram|Alpha. But now—thanks to the success of ChatGPT—as well as all the work we’ve done in making Wolfram|Alpha understand natural language—there’s finally the opportunity to combine these to make something much stronger than either could ever achieve on their own.

&lt;li>one might think that if one could just go on and “train a big enough network” one would be able to do absolutely anything with it. But it won’t work that way. Fundamental facts about computation—and notably the concept of
&lt;a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility" rel="noopener">computational irreducibility&lt;/a>—make it clear it ultimately can’t. But what’s more relevant is what we’ve seen in the actual history of machine learning. (

&lt;li>And yes, there’ll be plenty of cases where “raw ChatGPT” can help with people’s writing, make suggestions, or generate text that’s useful for various kinds of documents or interactions. But when it comes to setting up things that have to be perfect, machine learning just isn’t the way to do it—much as humans aren’t either. (

&lt;li>Wolfram|Alpha can communicate with it in what amounts to ChatGPT’s native language—natural language. And Wolfram|Alpha will take care of “adding the formality and precision” when it converts to its native language—Wolfram Language. It’s a very good situation, that I think has great practical potential. (

&lt;li>What about ChatGPT directly learning Wolfram Language? Well, yes, it could do that, and in fact it’s already started. And in the end I fully expect that something like ChatGPT will be able to
&lt;a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/11/how-should-we-talk-to-ais/" rel="noopener">operate directly in Wolfram Language&lt;/a>, and be very powerful in doing so. (

&lt;li>Wolfram|Alpha can communicate with it in what amounts to ChatGPT’s native language—natural language. And Wolfram|Alpha will take care of “adding the formality and precision” when it converts to its native language—Wolfram Language. It’s a very good situation, that I think has great practical potential. (

&lt;li>What about ChatGPT directly learning Wolfram Language? Well, yes, it could do that, and in fact it’s already started. And in the end I fully expect that something like ChatGPT will be able to

Stop loss. Common in gambling, how much you are willing to lose, spend. Related to sunk costs, it prevents you from taking irrational decisions.
Stick to your guns. Stick to 6 weeks, make it in 6 weeks. Dont bring other 6 weeks.
No one gets everything they want. Accept that fact and that some features will be out. You start building, and it takes longer than you thought. You got to trade concessions, you have to cut features.
It is a repeatable process that allows you to continue ship. You build a lot of stuff and make the products better. But accept that all of them left something in the table.
Nothing will clog down the momentum and motivation of a software development team like not being able to ship. You lose your capacity to ship.
If you practice beeing late you are going to be good at being late. If you practice shipping, you get good at shipping.
If you are unable to ship in time, you don&amp;rsquo;t ship whatever, you cut down scope. And if you have to cut down too much scope, you cancel projects. You dont put more hours. It is important that it is there, it keeps the system integral.
You dont want to be stuck for this one thing, you could be working in something else. It creates a very negative feedback.&lt;/li>
