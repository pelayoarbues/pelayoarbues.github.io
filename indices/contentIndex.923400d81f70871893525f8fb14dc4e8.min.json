{"/":{"title":"Pelayo Arbués","content":"\nHi folks!\n\nI'm Pelayo Arbués, currently based in Gijón and Madrid, Spain, and I'm the Head of Data Science at [idealista](https://www.idealista.com/), the leading real estate online marketplace in Southern Europe. With 8 years of experience in the industry, I am known for being able to effectively incorporate advanced analytics in products and for increasing awareness of the practical application of data science. \n\nMy academic background is in economics, with a Ph.D. in Transport Economics and regional science. I've worked as a researcher in academia and held past positions as a Senior Data Scientist at BBVA Next and Lead Data Scientist at Weplan.\n\nI'm passionate about problem-solving and love being a manager because it allows me to tackle various challenges related to strategy, processes, and people. My proudest achievements include developing a recommender system with a small team at a large retail company and raising a high-performance team at idealista.\n\nMy biggest dream is to apply my skills and experience to help address human challenges, and I aspire to be known for leading a team that works with high ethics and can deliver outstanding solutions.\n\nOutside of work, my hobbies include taking analog street photographs, reading, and spending quality time with my family. I love learning about creative processes, management, and philosophy. You can learn about my [current priorities here](now.md). \n\nWant to talk or need help with something? You can check my [Office Hours policy](Office%20hours.md). \n\n## Stuff I do\n\n- [Writing for learning](digital-garden.md)\n- [Talks, Interviews and Podcast participation](appearances/appearances.md)\n- [Research](research/research.md)\n- [Photography](photography/photography.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.31011686Z","tags":null},"/MOC-test":{"title":"","content":"[[]]","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.31011686Z","tags":null},"/Office-hours":{"title":"Office hours","content":"\nIn June 2020, I began dedicating an hour of my week to speaking with strangers. I enjoy meeting new people and missed attending events, and I believed that I could use my experience to help others. Throughout my life, I've been fortunate enough to receive guidance and support from [people who mentored me](notes/202302251202%20-%20Mentors%20and%20me.md) without expecting anything in return. I wanted to give back to society by offering the same kindness.\n\nInitially, I wasn't certain if anyone would be interested in speaking with me. However, to my surprise, within a few days, I received over 20 requests from people who wished to speak with me. I had to create a process to manage the requests.\n\n{{\u003c tweet user=\"pelayoarbues\" id=\"1272618802073780226\" \u003e}}\n\nSince then, up until the beginning of 2023, I've had over 60 conversations with people I've never met. Most of these individuals wished to discuss one of the following topics:\n-   Career advice: [What to study to become a data professional](writing/Data%20Science%20Fundamentals.md), the data roles market, how to build a strategy to land a data job, recommendations about companies/sectors, moving to management from a technical role...\n-   Team management: The difficulties of expanding a team, explaining the ROI to the board, selecting battles to fight, and more.\n-   Data product management: How to uncover opportunities, working with other roles, managing data projects, and more.\n-   Data strategy: Advice on establishing or expanding a data team, when to hire the first data scientist, how to locate data scientists, selecting which projects to work on, and more.\n-   Dataholic Anonymous meetings with individuals who have a similar level of experience. It's great to share pain points and challenges with others. It's quite a relief to realize that you're not the only one experiencing certain issues and to feel understood by a peer.\n    \n\nThings I do not offer:\n\n-   Free consultancy, including reviewing products, assisting with finding new talent, or writing job descriptions.

This week you will learn the basic theory of persuasive communication, including models of information processing, motivational appeals, message acceptance, fast and slow decision making and rules of effective human interactions.\n\n## **Telling your story: Developing a dramatic narrative**\n\nEffective storytelling starts with developing persuasive content, and then structuring a dramatic narrative that will spark the imagination. In week 2, you will learn how to apply storytelling principles like shaping the beginning, building the middle, and making the ending powerful. You will learn how to find the winning idea for your story, colour it with emotions, and use metaphors to quickly connect concepts in people’s minds.\n\n## **Connecting with people: Developing authenticity and building rapport**\n\nDeveloping rapport and trust is a crucial aspect of persuasion, in fact, it crucial for any form of supportive human interactions. Often times, this means being able to read a situation and adapt the approach accordingly. In week 3, you will learn how to speak authentically, and how to quickly build and maintain rapport. The means by which this can be accomplished include the use of verbal and non-verbal cues and the techniques of matching and mirroring the body language and vocal qualities of the other person.\n\n## **Talk the talk: Creating impressions and guiding influential conversations**\n\nGroup meetings can create lasting impressions, which is why it important that they are well run. But, more often than not, such meetings are unproductive. Stress and tension in meetings are also common. In week 4, you will learn how to lead influential group conversation by planning an effective meeting, be aware of the do’s and don’ts in meeting, avoid groupthink, and how to make better decisions.

Some are painful but necessary, like handling objections and overcoming resistance. In week 5, you will learn how to prepare for stressful conversations and deal with objections.You will understand the nature of the objections, why people make them, and then how to reduce their resistance, and defend your proposals against these objections.\n\n## **Winning over hearts and minds: How to pitch a brilliant idea**","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.482115142Z","tags":null},"/attachments/Data-Science-Fundamentals/Resources/Data-Science-Ethics":{"title":"Data Science Ethics","content":"\nCompetence: Ethics\nLevel: Foundation\n\n[Weapons of math destruction](https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/)\n\n---\n\n\"What are the ethical considerations regarding the privacy and control of consumer information and big data, especially in the aftermath of recent large-scale data breaches?\n\nThis course provides a framework to analyze these concerns as you examine the ethical and privacy implications of collecting and managing big data.

The best data analysts and data-minded engineers develop a reputation for making credible pronouncements from data. But what are they doing that gives them credibility? I often hear adjectives like *careful* and *methodical*, but what do the most careful and methodical analysts actually do?\n\nThis is not a trivial question, especially given the type of data that we regularly gather at Google. Not only do we typically work with very large data sets, but those data sets are extremely rich. That is, each row of data typically has many, many attributes. When you combine this with the temporal sequences of events for a given user, there are an enormous number of ways of looking at the data. Contrast this with a typical academic psychology experiment where it's trivial for the researcher to look at every single data point. The problems posed by our large, high-dimensional data sets are very different from those encountered throughout most of the history of scientific work.\n\nThis document summarizes the ideas and techniques that careful, methodical analysts use on large, high-dimensional data sets. Although this document focuses on data from logs and experimental analysis, many of these techniques are more widely applicable.\"\n\n[Good Data Analysis | ML Universal Guides | Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/good-data-analysis)\n\nContents:\n\n![Good%20Data%20Analysis%2004a423dcc28d4a1382ce02b7a80e0403/Untitled.png](attachments/Data%20Science%20Fundamentals/Resources/attachments/Untitled.png)","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.482115142Z","tags":null},"/attachments/Data-Science-Fundamentals/Resources/Introduction-to-Computer-Science":{"title":"Introduction to Computer Science","content":"\nCompetence: Tools of the Trade\nLevel: Recommended\n\nForget about your Python/R preferences , this course is focused on computational thinking. \n\n[Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/es/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7)\n\nWhat you will learn:\n\n- A Notion of computation\n- The Python programming language\n- Some simple algorithms\n- Testing and debugging\n- An informal introduction to algorithmic complexity\n- Data structuresAnother introductory course:\n\n[CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0)","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.482115142Z","tags":null},"/attachments/Data-Science-Fundamentals/Resources/Linear-Algebra":{"title":"Linear Algebra","content":"\nCompetence: Maths\nLevel: Foundation\n\nMany Data Science techniques are applications of Linear Algebra, so it is important to dust off your knowledge in this topic. \n\n[A 2020 Vision of Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-010-a-2020-vision-of-linear-algebra-spring-2020/)\n\n[Linear Algebra Done Wrong](https://www.math.brown.edu/~treil/papers/LADW/LADW-2014-09.pdf)\n\n\"It supposed to be a first linear algebra course for mathematically advanced students.

Comps are key: an AVM evaluates a property relative to its comps, assimilating those data into a single number quantifying the property’s value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh2we0jekv6cp9r3wztcp6j))\n- Many companies have an “AI strategy,” but at Opendoor (scare quotes) “AI” *is the business*.

That is, a home is priced by a human real estate agent who consults comps (those same comps again) and defines/adjusts the listing’s price based on:\n  • the recency of the comps (which factors in home price fluctuations)\n  • how fancy/new/desirable the comps are relative to the subject property ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh38jfwm18qphf21nvgrjfy))\n- Comp prices are *more than correlative*: a nearby comp selling for more than its intrinsic value *literally causes one’s home to be worth more*, as no shopper will be able to perfectly parse the underlying “intrinsic value” from the “noise (error)” of previous home sales. This overvaluation *propagates causally into the future prices of other nearby homes.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh399gqb68ghhz866q0r4s4))\n- Deep learning, through categorical feature embeddings, unlocks an extremely powerful treatment of high-cardinality categorical variables that is ill-approximated by ML stalwarts like linear models and Gradient Boosted Trees. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh3jwfdregdp9c4fzsbrppg))\n- Real estate has surprising similarities to NLP: high-cardinality features such as postal code, census block, school district, etc. are nearly as central to home valuations as words are to language. By providing access to best-in-class handling of categorical features, a deep learning based solution immediately resolved a primary flaw of our system. Better yet, we didn’t need to lift a finger, as embedding layers are a provided building-block in all modern deep learning frameworks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh3kdct4a5x3pzvgp4b3cxp))\n- The final unresolved defect of our prior algorithm was its inability to jointly optimize parameters across sub-model boundaries. For instance, the model that assigned comp weights did not “talk” to the model that predicted the dollar-value of the comp-adjustment that would bring said comp to parity with the subject listing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh3ktsgew81kcy1xpkg2k8n))\n- PyTorch, cleanly resolves this fault, as well. We can define sub-modules of our network to tackle the adjustment and weighting schemes for each comp, and autograd will handle backward-pass gradient propagation within and between the sub-modules of the net. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh3mj8d92ttjtq4t9tdbtf7))\n- There are several approaches to model this process (while enabling joint-optimization). We’ve had success with many model paradigms presently popular in **NLP** and/or **image retrieval / visual search**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh3n4g1fb1437td6v3phvcc))\n- • Transformer-style network architectures that accept a variable-length sequence of feature vectors (perhaps words or houses) and emit a sequence or single number quantifying an output\n  • [Siamese Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_neural_network) that compare, for example, images or home listings and produce a number/vector quantifying the similarity between any two of them\n  • [Triplet loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplet_loss) frameworks for similarity detection (and, more recently, contrastive-loss approaches spiritually similar to triplet loss)\n  • Embedding lookup schemes such as [Locality Sensitive Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing) that efficiently search a vector-space for similar entities to a query-vector of interest ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh3nt0gqmcnh7wn8cj21ee7))\n- The process of valuing a home is similar to NLP for one key reason: a home “lives” in a neighborhood just as a word “lives” in a sentence. Using the local context to understand a word works well; it is intuitive that a comparable method could succeed in real estate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh3p5rbtyb5smdveewaf1cv))\n- Image retrieval hinges on querying a massive database for images similar to the query image — a process quite aligned with the comparable-listing selection process.\n  Which model works best will depend on the specifics of the issue one is trying to solve. Building a world-class AVM involves geographical nuance as well: an ensemble of models stratified by region and/or urban/suburban/exurban localization may leverage many or all of the above methodologies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh3psv2f1emjs98ty7b954w))\n- With our network(s) we must be able to answer two key questions:\n  1. How much more (or less) expensive is some comp listing than the listing of interest?\n  2. How much weight (if any) should be assigned to said comp, relative to the other comps? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh3q3m7p0kvdkdcyckkv7jv))\n- The module might take in tabular data (about the listing’s features), photos, satellite imagery, text, etc. It may also use contextual information, including information about the other comps available for the given listing of interest — a transformer’s *self-attention* aligns well with this notion of contextual info. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh3r0bdxrqaxcyferde4bgh))\n- • An estimate of the relative price difference between a given (subject, comp) listing pair\n  • A “logit” (un-normalized weight) characterizing the relative strength of a comp ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh3va19n5adpknrgvdwh1pd))\n- Because the comp weights should sum to one, a normalization scheme (perhaps softmax, sparsemax, or a learned reduction-function) is employed after the weights are computed. Recall that the comparable properties have already recently sold (never mind active listings for now), so their close prices are known. That close price, augmented by the price delta computed in (1), is itself a powerful predictor of the close price of the subject listing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh3w4d107pzbgewsc9z2w2f))\n- These transformer-based techniques from NLP work well because each comp can be viewed as a draw from a relatively homogeneous bag of possible comparable properties. In this capacity, comps are quite similar to words in the context of a language model: atomic units that together form a “sentence” that describes the subject listing and speculates regarding its worth.\n  Though, deciding which words (comps) to place in that sentence is a tricky problem in its own right. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh3wz26vf6y408829bphdb8))\n- Once the aforementioned quantities are in hand, the valuation process reduces immediately to a standard regression problem:\n  1. The observed comp close prices are adjusted via the values proposed by our network\n  2. These adjusted close prices are reduced, via a weighted-average-like procedure, to a point estimate of the subject’s close price\n  3.

It seems natural, then, that a deep learning model would leverage these images when comparing homes to one another during the appraisal process. After all, one of the great success stories of deep learning is the field of computer vision. Transitioning OVM to deep learning has the added benefit of making it much easier to incorporate mixed-media data, such as images and text (from listings, tax documents, etc.) into our core algorithm.

This establishes a stable user base with enough data for a data scientist to parse usage patterns and identify trends. Another good benchmark to keep an eye out for is that when your company hits the 50+ employees mark, where more specific functions are being built out (like finance), it’s likely time to consider a full-time data scientist.

It’s still very early days for all of this, but it’s already very impressive—and one can begin to see how amazingly powerful (and perhaps even revolutionary) what we can call “ChatGPT + Wolfram” can be. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwkttk557r6v8a1zqxzn5rts))\n- How did this work? Under the hood, ChatGPT is formulating a query for Wolfram|Alpha—then [sending it to Wolfram|Alpha for computation](https://www.wolfram.com/resources/tools-for-AIs/), and then “deciding what to say” based on reading the results it got back ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwktvp63h8c97r03119y6ysr))\n- Since [ChatGPT uses randomness](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/) in generating its responses, different things can happen even when you ask it the exact same question (even in a fresh session). It feels “very human”. But different from the solid “right-answer-and-it-doesn’t-change-if-you-ask-it-again” experience that one gets in Wolfram|Alpha and Wolfram Language. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwktxgzwcyrpyatz7k3hwefd))\n## New highlights added March 28, 2023 at 9:32 PM\n- we’re acting much more like a true “brain implant” for ChatGPT—where it asks us things whenever it needs to, and we give responses that it can weave back into whatever it’s doing. It’s rather impressive to see in action. And—although there’s definitely much more polishing to be done—what’s already there goes a long way towards (among other things) giving ChatGPT the ability to deliver accurate, curated knowledge and data—as well as correct, nontrivial computations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwmqrz8r07tm2pv44p5kbg4d))\n- Wolfram Language, on the other hand, is set up to be precise and well defined—and capable of being used to build arbitrarily sophisticated towers of computation. Inside Wolfram|Alpha, what it’s doing is to translate natural language to precise Wolfram Language. In effect it’s catching the “imprecise natural language” and “funneling it” into precise Wolfram Language. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwmrhdgh7yar8dvm0m8ta4qr))\n- Sometimes we’ve found we have to be quite insistent (note the all caps): “When writing Wolfram Language code, NEVER use snake case for variable names; ALWAYS use camel case for variable names.” And even with that insistence, ChatGPT will still sometimes do the wrong thing. The whole process of “prompt engineering” feels a bit like animal wrangling: you’re trying to get ChatGPT to do what you want, but it’s hard to know just what it will take to achieve that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwmrm5v1zkk0vj89h20zzye3))\n- Well, here’s the issue. Traditional programming languages are centered around telling a computer what to do in the computer’s terms: set this variable, test that condition, etc. But it doesn’t have to be that way. And instead one can start from the other end: take things people naturally think in terms of, then try to represent these computationally—and effectively automate the process of getting them actually implemented on a computer ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwms9jb55zmpa6b29tpdjmkz))\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.486115102Z","tags":null},"/literature-notes/Articles/ChatGPT-Plugins":{"title":"ChatGPT Plugins","content":"# ChatGPT Plugins\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://openai.com/favicon.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[openai.com]]\n- Full Title: ChatGPT Plugins\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins\n\n## Highlights\n- Though not a perfect analogy, plugins can be “eyes and ears” for language models, giving them access to information that is too recent, too personal, or too specific to be included in the training data. In response to a user’s explicit request, plugins can also enable language models to perform safe, constrained actions on their behalf, increasing the usefulness of the system overall.\n  We expect that open standards will emerge to unify the ways in which applications expose an AI-facing interface. We are working on an early attempt at what such a standard might look like, and we’re looking for feedback from developers interested in building with us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh4vdsf51fynwd7zmg1j25g))\n- Plugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language models, including “hallucinations,” keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external data—such as up-to-date information online, code-based calculations, or custom plugin-retrieved information—language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh4x99f6jsbz9vq99xxabfd))\n- our red teamers discovered ways for plugins—if released without safeguards—to perform sophisticated prompt injection, send fraudulent and spam emails, bypass safety restrictions, or misuse information sent to the plugin. We’re using these findings to inform safety-by-design mitigations that restrict risky plugin behaviors and improve transparency of how and when they're operating as part of the user experience. We're also using these findings to inform our decision to gradually deploy access to plugins. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh4y8nsxzr9qbqph300qke2))\n- we recently released a [working paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130) which found that language models with access to tools will likely have much greater economic impacts than those without, and more generally, in line with [other](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4350925) [researchers’](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06590) findings, we expect the current wave of AI technologies to have a big effect on the pace of job transformation, displacement, and creation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh4ysj41wtf9a121q73d1vk))\n- We’ve created a web browsing plugin which gives a language model access to a web browser, with its design prioritizing both safety and operating as a good citizen of the web. The plugin’s text-based web browser is limited to making GET requests, which reduces (but does not eliminate) certain classes of safety risks. This scopes the browsing plugin to be useful for retrieving information, but excludes “transactional” operations such as form submission which have more surface area for security and safety issues ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh52w9df6teqgpx2gnm70c4))\n- Browsing retrieves content from the web using the Bing search API. As a result, we inherit substantial work from Microsoft on (1) source reliability and truthfulness of information and (2) “safe-mode” to prevent the retrieval of problematic content. The plugin operates within an isolated service, so ChatGPT’s browsing activities are separated from the rest of our infrastructure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh53b95v255w0mtc9nd3t0r))\n- We would like our models to be able to use their [programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374) [skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774) to provide a much more natural interface to most fundamental capabilities of our computers. Having access to a very eager junior programmer working at the speed of your fingertips can make completely new workflows effortless and efficient, as well as open the benefits of programming to new audiences. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh5s6frp3grctt85t2ypx5p))\n- As an open-source and self-hosted solution, developers can deploy their own version of the plugin and register it with ChatGPT. The plugin leverages [OpenAI embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) and allows developers to choose a vector database ([Milvus](https://milvus.io/), [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/), [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/vectors/), [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) or [Zilliz](https://zilliz.com/)) for indexing and searching documents.

It consists of a set of python scripts, tools, and models developed primarily for research. There are a lot of parts in such a system. These include two BERT-based models for encoding text to embedding vectors, another BERT-based model for extracting answers, approximate nearest-neighbor similarity search and text-based BM25 methods for retrieving candidates, tokenizers, and so on ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvp27rk8s6px2d6was5b67av))\n- We thought it would be interesting to consolidate these different parts and demonstrate how to build an open-domain question-answering serving system with Vespa.ai that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvp28gav3f7qq1rjw8gnnz92))\n- Vespa is designed as a highly performant and scalable production-ready system. Thus, it offers a simplified path to deployment in production without coping with the complexity of maintaining many different subsystems. That makes Vespa an attractive package.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvp299tr8w4njt20pay2kk6f))\n- The Natural Questions benchmark consists of natural language questions and answers. How to retrieve and represent the knowledge required to answer the questions is up to each system. There are two main approaches to this: retrieval and parametric. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvp2a23kvt8gykn19b9p7ahf))\n## New highlights added March 17, 2023 at 9:01 PM\n- A retrieval-based question answering system typically stores its “knowledge” in an information retrieval system. This can be sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvqy2z910vjwbhvg9vebayna))\n- The retriever is responsible for generating a set of candidate passages. Since the subsequent reader component is expensive to evaluate, it is crucial to have an effective retrieval mechanism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvqy3gqgw6v7vkxfj3ny6224))\n- The number of potential terms in a vocabulary can be vast indeed. The basic idea behind embedding vectors is to compress this high dimensional sparse vector to a much smaller dense vector where most dimensions contain a non-zero value. This has the effect of projecting a query or document vector into a lower-dimensional space. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvqy4g2w29vxxr65m82k0n13))\n- he DPR paper uses two BERT models to encode text: one for encoding queries and one for encoding documents. The two models are trained simultaneously in a two-tower configuration to maximize the dot product for passages likely to answer the question. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvqy4vx490nzvggesdvskc30))\n- we trade accuracy for efficiency in what is called approximate nearest neighbors (ANN). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvqy56drdbmmh58xgarfaw8w))\n- . HNSW is based on graph structures, is efficient, and has an attractive property where the graph can be incrementally built at runtime. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvqy5np77bgkpj1rnmec5h1k))\n- Retrieval based on semantic embeddings complements term-based retrieval well. Semantically similar documents can be recalled even though they don’t contain the exact same terms. Unlike the bag-of-words approach for term-based retrieval, word order can provide additional context. Historically, however, term-based retrieval has outperformed semantic embeddings on question answering problems, but the DPR paper shows that dense retrieval can be vastly improved if the encoding has specifically been trained to the task. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvqy6q0z0229tjcsncdtyrnk))\n- While the retriever component’s job is to produce a set of candidate passages that hopefully contain the answer to the question, the reader extracts the passages’ actual answer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvqy7jn27jdtwj9rcges8y5p))\n- Due to BERT models’ full attention mechanism, evaluation time increases quadratically with sequence length. So a reasonable balance must be struck, and BERT-based models use a WordPiece or similar algorithm to split less common words into subwords. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvqy84kx3sjjd5pqak40k8av))\n- To extract the final answer, the passage that produced the largest relevance score is used. The two other outputs of the model are probabilities for each token of being a start token and an end token. The final answer is chosen by finding the span with the largest sum of start probability and end probability.

Because the key to being a data product manager is knowing when it isn’t all about the data. At some point, you may get no improvement from technical enhancements.

We build personas to represent different user types and characteristics of those users that use the product we build in a consistent or similar way. People are *not* personas.

It is much easier to define these personas upfront that do it in an intense moment of planning or prioritization where time and patience are often much lower in availability. If you have these personas and socialize them in your company, you’ll be much better off when it comes to hard decisions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkvdfm67ktvrn8hgvd27n2))\n- Push actively against the “Person X wants us to build Product Y” mentality. Many organizations I have been a part of justify product decisions with a name of someone who wants it, rather than the personas that they product actually serves. Specific people and decision makers are temporary at companies, but personas are long lasting. Ask about the persona. This is where having the personas laid out already pays off. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkw6zsve17exmjywwf48er))\n- It sounds simple to say focus on the persona. But power structures in an organization are a very real thing. It is hard for a data scientist or product manager to tell a VP that the product doesn’t clearly address a persona. This is where leadership matters a great deal. If you want to see change in this space, it cannot just be put on individual contributors. Leadership needs to sponsor these ideas and these processes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkwnmtrst7s3vzbx5x7zd4))\n- If your company deprioritizes an area of investment, think about how your product investment should reflect that (or not). It is really common for a company to pivot investment in an “area” (which might be a key persona for your product) but the rest of the company does not quickly update to reflect that pivot. Specifically, you might have close relationships with key stakeholders who tell you “yeah, that isn’t important to the company, but I need it to do my job.” Be very wary of this type of situation. By focusing on people, it is easy to get confused about “what matters”. By focusing on where the company is headed and how different personas are part of that, it is easier to think less through the lens of working relationships and more through where the company needs to go.

This leaves you with a choice between shifting right to hard and high-impact or shifting down to easy and low-impact. The latter choice--easy and low-impact--is what Walk refers to as *snacking*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gryntktdj6bnf6wzyhw42acv))\n- When you're busy, these snacks give a sense of accomplishment that makes them psychologically rewarding. Still, you're unlikely to learn much from doing them, others are likely equally capable of completing them (*and* for some of them, it might be a good development opportunity), and there's a tremendous opportunity cost versus doing something higher impact. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grynvgdsndf2q85kc66qvf1q))\n- It's ok to spend some of your time on snacks to keep yourself motivated between bigger accomplishments, but you have to keep yourself honest about how much time you're spending on high-impact work versus low-impact work. In senior roles, you're more likely to self-determine your work, and if you're not deliberately tracking your work, it's easy to catch yourself doing little to no high-impact work.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyaycwp2q18zky66byh98na7))\n- Model source code is written by engineers to solve a given purpose (such as ranking posts), and then one or more model binaries are trained from this source, often being created periodically for either iterative model improvements or retrainin ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyaydj44ghznn60qhw9fe6m2))\n- After selecting the model artifact to measure, additional complexity arises when artifacts with the same function have different labels in different tools ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyayf02c5dv7mbpd6vhrqyw8))\n- , where system 1 calls the model source code the “Model,” with another term denoting the trained binaries, and system 2 considers binaries the “Model,” calling the model source code something else. If we were to select all “Models” from these systems, we’d get a mix of source code and binaries, which are not comparable. T ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyayfggtntzg243xe69fdra9))\n- To avoid inconsistency while maintaining decentralization of our AI systems, we’ve worked toward consolidating certain logging information into a single platform that can then serve various needs when queried. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyayg7dqeyt0sc98vv9v0whx))\n- • A feature source record stores the origin of data for a particular feature.\n  • These sources are linked to any number of logical feature records, which store the logic to transform the raw data into a training dataset.\n  • Model code and its training dataset are connected to a workflow run, which is a pipeline that executes to produce one or more model binaries.\n  • Finally, the model binaries are linked to one or more model deployments, which track each place where binaries are serving inference requests.

Implementing a hierarchical framework structure to group metrics can help alleviate this problem. These groupings constitute a graph of metrics and their aggregations for each model, and various nodes on that graph can be reported for different purposes. Ag ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyayk7nfsmmmzr8kdd3g01hx))\n- • Think about how different tools contribute to a generic AI development process, and map outputs from various tools to consistent artifacts in that process.\n  • If your AI systems are complex and can’t be consolidated, think of measurement as a platform with a metadata graph and common interoperability standards.\n  • For a broad view of outcomes, consider a metric framework that can compare and aggregate across model management domains.

The Composer library has a number of well-tuned configurations for training a variety of models and for different types of training objectives. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyhks8224ayssbs55dwsghe0))\n- In determining the parameters of our model, we consider a variety of trade-offs between model size, context window, inference time, memory footprint, and more. Larger models typically offer better performance and are more capable of transfer learning. Yet these models have higher computational requirements for both training and inference. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyhksr2cwczb2mjxr7rjg5gg))\n- we also choose from a variety of training objectives, each with their own unique advantages and drawbacks. The most common training objective is next token prediction. This typically works well for code completion, but fails to take into account the context further downstream in a document. This can be mitigated by using a \"fill-in-the-middle\" objective, where a sequence of tokens in a document are masked and the model must predict them using the surrounding context. Yet another approach is UL2 (Unsupervised Latent Language Learning), which frames different objective functions for training language models as denoising tasks, where the model has to recover missing sub-sequences of a given input. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyhkt9ts24dtzj13ctf8p4h3))\n- We use the model to generate a block of Python code given a function signature and docstring.

As I’ve mentioned already the system prompt is the bot’s ‘brief’ which defines its character, purpose and available actions. Different applications will require very different prompts, and some prompts will be far longer than others ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtfc01yrecbg6kvrh0ms1b0m))\n- As you can see it’s just text, but it will never be included in the chat messages - your system prompt is sent with every request, so the tokens you use here are constant overhead.

I can’t say for certain why, but this approach seems to have a small improvement on the bot’s ability to understand and act upon the user’s request. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtfc1njm466q74zejc6vfvfe))\n- One of the core things that’ll set your chatbot apart from vanilla ChatGPT is giving it the ability to ‘do’ things. Performing actions outside of its sandbox is a very exciting and compelling prospect, but it comes with its own challenges and potential risks. You should always be extremely careful when passing the output of these LLMs, which is untrusted, as an input into another servic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtfc30124dqf9vj39fnwcyy1))\n- Now this may look odd but there is method to the madness, the most important part of it is the closing tag `\u003c/|search_query|\u003e` as this tag is a stop sequence, so in reality this tag will never actually appear in the output. The API tells us it’s termination reason, so we know when it’s stopped due to a stop-sequence, and with a bit of parsing it’s then trivial to see the request it’s created for our subroutine. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtfca57560qkn3mqx94hgdy3))\n- once we’ve identified and parsed the request (I use a combination of sub-string operations and regular expressions) you can then perform whatever subroutine you require, in our case we’ll pass the query off to our semantic codebase search engine. Once that subroutine is complete, we need to pass in the results into the context window, this is memory insertion – making the chatbot believe that it came up with these results, as it has no way of knowing once you make the next request ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtfcb0fexevj9ev9eak6qz0w))\n- Once you’ve inserted your results you can either: end that turn there by inserting a `\u003c|im_end|\u003e` message, or you can just leave the conversation open-ended and let the bot continue outputting as if it had just come up with the results itself - this choice will depend on your usecase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtfcc3xk00vsfp90bhv5cd0y))\n- This is the most approximate way I’ve found for getting equivalent functionality to “Let’s think step-by-step” in the ChatGPT prompting world. It forces the model to verbalise it’s reasoning and pre-medidate it’s acutal answer before delivering it. A final tip I’d give on this front: to ensure that the model always produces these pre-message tokens I start my assistant completions with \u003c|user_intonation and let it continue from there, so it doesn’t ignore it or choose to omit that step. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtfceacfz9scm3zz8m6xfkf1))\n- I’d reiterate that having a strong function to strip out content that the user shouldn’t see from the chat messages is very important, we have tags we can wrap things in to ensure that entire blocks won’t render in the final chat messages, e.g if your query involves a search to make it happen, but isn’t itself inately a search query, then you shouldn’t show the search results in the returned message.

A typical prompt include a few examples of queries and relevant documents, then the LLM is “asked” to generate syntetic queries for many of the documents in the corpus. The generated syntetic query, document pairs can be used to train neural ranking models.

Many times folks look at new roles as less important, often framing them as service roles to absorb work they’re disinterested in. Sometimes roles are even explicitly designed this way, intended to reduce work for another role as opposed to having an empowering mission of their own. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx9eeczbtdkz15mere6933jd))\n- **Brittle organization**. As you move away from generalized roles and towards specialists, an unexpected consequence is that your organization has far more single points of failure.

Unfortunately, generally folks don’t take much time to appreciate these distinctions, and instead pattern match on how they’ve seen the role done elsewhere. This is a powerful force. Some meaningfully large percentage of folks will both avoid taking any steps to learn how the role is intended to function–reading documentation, asking about the approach–and continue to express surprise that it doesn’t work exactly the way they saw at a previous company.

Many roles start by taking on work that is viewed as disinteresting by the role shedding that responsibility, and consequently folks in that role tend to view that work as trivial and unimportant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx9egj51sntrr7m42wc0d3fp))\n- **Too “trivial” to promote**. Similar to the above, often you’ll find the work done by new roles to be valued very highly in terms of impact, but not viewed as sufficiently “strategic” to merit promotion ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx9egza9xmbg8mkefd8zwxyt))\n- **Recruiting rare humans**. For entirely great reasons, folks want the first hires they make into a new role to be strong role models for the entire function.

It suggests that trimming the \"overgrown crown\" and having smaller teams can result in faster progress and less frustration. It proposes that if more than two people are needed, it is better to add another two-person team rather than adding people to the existing team. It encourages companies to adopt Shape Up and scope and shape their work accordingly to achieve the most efficient results.\n- URL: https://world.hey.com/jason/just-the-two-of-us-afb2f54e\n\n## Highlights\n- both [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) and [HEY](https://hey.com) are built by multiple teams of two [using our Shape Up process](https://basecamp.com/shapeup).

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv1mvsjxz0zd002twzwg2e01))\n- a typical prerequisite is to split text into sections (for example, via utilities in the [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain?ref=matt-boegner) package), then calculate embeddings on those chunks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv1nmcb7mjrspg71925en4q5))\n- when a user submits a question, an LLM processes the message in multiple ways, but the key step is calculating another embedding - this time, of the user’s text. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv1nmrwedznrrdkqrvvwrvam))\n- This semantic search is based on the “learned” concepts of the language model and is not limited to just a search for keywords.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv1nncggw6yhptny71s0g0jc))\n- Finally, we provide the relevant information from which the language model can answer using specific data. In its simplest form, we simply append (“Document 1: ”+ text chunk 1 + “\\nDocument 2: ” + text chunk 2 + …) until the context is filled. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv1p0v3rnn91jj827mz2zx33))\n- .

Consider a clinical documentation application: you may want the text to include both high-level instructions (\"here are general ways to improve your heart health\") and low-level text (reference side effects and instructions for a particular blood pressure drug regimen). There are a few different ways of traversing the tree to generate a response, two of which are shown below.\n  ![](https://mattboegner.com/content/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-31-at-2.17.14-PM.png)\n  ![](https://mattboegner.com/content/images/2023/01/tree-summarization.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv1p5wq67jcq2bm6jfnav3nt))\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.486115102Z","tags":null},"/literature-notes/Articles/La-%23Bonilista-El-C%C3%ADrculo-De-Caca":{"title":"La #Bonilista: El Círculo De Caca 💩","content":"# La #Bonilista: El Círculo De Caca 💩\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://mcusercontent.com/374c664073e1a1fa3deca53b4/images/92de885a-a475-1b9d-a91a-f2524ab3f139.jpeg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Bonilista Archive Feed]]\n- Full Title: La #Bonilista: El Círculo De Caca 💩\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://mailchi.mp/bonillaware/circulo-de-caca\n\n## Highlights\n- La subcontratación de personal técnico es un negocio de volumen. Por ejemplo, Atos —una de las 10 firmas de consultoría informática más grandes del mundo— declaró [un margen operativo de apenas el 3,14% en 2022](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ATOS-SE-4612/financials/). \n  Como se trabaja con un margen tan bajo, **las empresas apenas pueden permitirse tener plantilla desasignada y, por eso, suelen contratar bajo demanda**, solo cuando el cliente lo solicita ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy4ta9q636rfsdzq3q43aa9k))\n- La contratación bajo demanda implica que los nuevos empleados se pongan a trabajar directamente en proyectos del cliente, lo que **despoja a la empresa de un tiempo mínimo para constatar que tienen un nivel concreto de conocimientos técnicos y buenas prácticas** —más allá de lo evaluado en el proceso de selección— y, en caso contrario, dotarles de ambos. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy4ta5vn44e6yww6qe0qww9f))\n- Y cuando los clientes no perciben valor añadido **se produce una «commoditización» o falta de diferenciación entre los servicios ofrecidos por las diferentes empresas, más allá del coste de los mismos**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy4tavw6drbpyf92zxyezv4f))\n- Y aunque aun no tengamos una respuesta clara sobre cómo romper el círculo, hemos empezado a formular diferentes hipótesis. Por ejemplo, que nadie pueda ir directamente a cliente sin haber pasado antes por un bootcamp interno —aunque, a corto plazo, eso vaya contra el margen de las compañías— o diseñar un «ciclo de vida de proyecto» que permita ir sustituyendo gradualmente perfiles más senior por otros más junior. para garantizar la sostenibilidad y continuidad del mismo.

The truth is that if you are surrounded by professionals is that they might need more context for doing a good job.\n   Management is more creative as it seems, how to structure your team, how to design effective processes, always having an eye on people development and delivery levels.\n   Management is a form of multiplying yourself and your very ultimate objective is to **make your team work well**.\n   Management is hard and is more a craft than something you can learn. \n   Go to therapy to understand your inner tendencies and patterns. You have to deal with your fears and insecurities, you have the feeling of your technical skills degrade over time.\n   # Management definition \n   For the author management is not a role, is a constellation of roles. The main difficulty, besides a calendar packed of meetings with different people and projects is to change hats from minute to minute:\n   - People manager\n   - Resource manager\n   - Project manager\n   - Communications manager\n   - Process manager\n   - Technical mentor and coach\n   # Meetings are the main tool of a manager\n   From 1-1 meetings, team meetings and project specific ones. \n   # Managers words carry a lot of power\n   You are not a random member of your team anymore\n   # Resource management is particularly hard\n   # Mentoring is different for teaching\n   Mentoring as manager is more coaching than teaching. Difficult to let people find the time to study and develop while keeping a high speed delivery service\n   \n- URL: https://alexkgold.space/mfy.html?utm_campaign=Data_Elixir\u0026utm_source=Data_Elixir_369\n\n## Highlights\n- I’ve found management most exciting as a form of leverage.

Compared to conventional measures of greenspace accessibility, the results show that accounting for school and commuting settings in addition to residences captures previously untapped accessibility aspects. The article discusses four types of greenspace accessibility measures: travel cost, statistical index, buffer zone, and spatial interaction, and introduces the betweenness measure for greenspace accessibility. The study focuses on the three largest Dutch cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague), and calculates greenspace accessibility from home, educational facilities, and on-the-move from home to educational facility. The results suggest that measuring greenspace accessibility from educational or on-the-move settings often yields different scores relative to the ones calculated with conventional metrics, and provide new perspectives on greenspace accessibility.\n- URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971522001569?via%3Dihub\n\n## Highlights\n- This article introduces a novel method to measure greenspace accessibility that considers access from different activity settings (i.e., homes, schools, and the commutes between them) for children and adolescents, while accounting for the dependency of human access on the road network.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwvajxzqg06hsykqaq6x6ev6))\n- **The copilot helps the pilot stay on track, identify critical flaws, and call out blindspots.** This includes periodic check-ins, reviewing document drafts and prototypes, and being a mandatory code reviewer. For example, the copilot should challenge the pilot if the proposed design doesn’t solve the business problem, or if the train-validation split is invalid. To be able to spot these issues, the copilot typically has experience in the problem space, or has more experience in general, similar to how senior engineers guide juniors.

As an applied scientist, I often partner with an engineer who helps with infrastructure, observability, CI/CD, etc. If both scientist and engineer are sufficiently experienced, they can double up as each other’s copilot. As they review each other’s work, knowledge transfer occurs organically and they learn to be effective copilots for other engineers or scientists in future projects.

It sets out principles to maximize the good and minimize the bad, and to ensure that the benefits of AGI are widely and fairly shared. It also outlines short-term and long-term steps to ensure that AI is developed safely and responsibly, including public standards for when an AGI effort should stop a training run, decide a model is safe to release, or pull a model from production use. Ultimately, the goal is for AGI to be an amplifier of humanity, and to ensure a successful transition to a world with superintelligence.\n   1. How can we ensure that access to AGI is widely and fairly shared?\n   2. What can be done to minimize the risks of misuse, drastic accidents, and societal disruption associated with AGI?\n   3. How can we develop mechanisms for ensuring coordination among AGI efforts in order to ensure a safe transition to a world with superintelligence?\n   \n- URL: https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/\n\n## Highlights\n- as we create successively more powerful systems, we want to deploy them and gain experience with operating them in the real world. We believe this is the best way to carefully steward AGI into existence—a gradual transition to a world with AGI is better than a sudden one. We expect powerful AI to make the rate of progress in the world much faster, and we think it’s better to adjust to this incrementally. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt2w4c027tz3t0tf6am47ghh))\n- We think it’s important that efforts like ours submit to independent audits before releasing new systems; we will talk about this in more detail later this year. At some point, it may be important to get independent review before starting to train future systems, and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute used for creating new models ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt2wa5m5m9n4zsj2j3ck6wp5))\n- It’s possible that AGI capable enough to accelerate its own progress could cause major changes to happen surprisingly quickly (and even if the transition starts slowly, we expect it to happen pretty quickly in the final stages).

Software production has been too complex and expensive for too long, which has caused us to underproduce software for decades, resulting in immense, society-wide technical debt. This technical debt is about to contract in a dramatic, economy-wide fashion as the cost and complexity of software production collapses, releasing a wave of innovation.

Lo que está claro es que hay algo que ocurre en el comportamiento humano y de muchos animales y es que somos capaces de hacer cosas inesperadas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx340xxqcsbwc52w5dptzjbt))\n- Uno tiene que ver con la teoría general de cómo funciona el cerebro y dice que el cerebro puede estar diseñado por la evolución para predecir el futuro y somos hipersensibles a las cosas que no predecimos. Los gusanos se preocupan de lo que va a ocurrir en unos segundos, las moscas de lo que va a pasar en los próximos minutos y los humanos de lo que va a ocurrir en los próximos 100 años, que es de lo que estamos hablando en esta conversación.

The outputs from red-teaming (just like adversarial attacks) are generally used to train the model to be less likely to cause harm or steer it away from undesirable outputs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt2f1qemdk07r7qm7aeetj17))\n- there is tension between the model being *helpful* (by following instructions) and being *harmless* (or at least less likely to enable harm). This is where red-teaming can be very useful. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt2f2kfasnjtkmrssy8ja1m1))\n- the only way to actually know what LLMs are capable of as they get more powerful is to simulate all possible scenarios that could lead to malovalent outcomes and evaluate the model's behavior in each of those scenarios. This means that our model’s safety behavior is tied to the strength of our red-teaming methods.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73j49r9ecrs8s08cf39zkb))\n- However, a lot of the siloed knowledge in data teams comes not from how to build something in progress, but rather existing systems, historical analyses, decisions, and events. If one person from the data team defined a key metric or designed a dashboard, they accumulated a lot of context in that process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73mkcestd9bakdk0ba4syg))\n- The activities we suggest starting with for small teams continue to add value over time, so if your team is bigger and not doing these things yet, it’s not too late to begin. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73nasgjgzdqsd3t65kxqw4))\n- First data hire — get a head start on documentation\n  When you’re a team of one, there’s naturally a lottery factor. While it is unrealistic to eradicate the lottery factor entirely, there are still a few steps you can take to get started. But naturally, all of these are asynchronous ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73phq09dkaxg6agfq77by5))\n- If you are at this stage, you have enough on your plate as is. We are not going to lecture you on how important it is to build things elegantly or efficiently, or having perfect documentation. You want to get things done, quickly. But it is still possible to balance having *some* code comments. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73pz0g5xhgz1ztxry8a92e))\n- Whether or not you have consciously thought about it, you probably have a knowledge base. It can be in Google Drive, Confluence, Notion, or many other tools — but a central location for many different pieces of information is a valuable resource. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73qhy805kz799754vgjjta))\n- Additionally, the knowledge base has greater and greater utility as more team members join and more notable, documentable things happen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73qvtb9q378r8sw1gw9y4z))\n- The benefit of the knowledge base is contingent upon actually populating it with analyses, style guides, meeting notes, handy queries, and anything else relevant to your team members. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73re4dxn4hd9j1ad1ezgwq))\n- Create a changelog\n  Michelle Ballen [wrote for Locally Optimistic back in 2018](https://locallyoptimistic.com/post/adding_context_with_annotations/) about keeping a log of notable events that may impact your data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73rwyy0ck2czvgh9ytbazd))\n- Even just a date and a quick note about what happened is enough to be a big help to anyone who’s wondering a year into the future why sales spiked on a certain day, or why there were no signups for a three-day span. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73s5ga7g5g77sqh26438zd))\n- The changelog is valuable at any team size, so teams of one or larger would benefit from starting to capture knowledge today. It has been a huge value-add to our team at Future (data team of five, 40 data consumers), where there are frequent feature releases to our app and adjustments to our digital marketing strategy.

You are excited to have much more capacity once your new teammate is fully up to speed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73t4tj8qrd39jrhv7mzaws))\n- you probably don’t yet have the documentation of your dreams built out. This places the burden of knowledge sharing on both of you — your new teammate needs to be proactive in asking questions and reading through existing codebases and data products, and you will need to spend a lot of face time with them demonstrating best practices and providing feedback on their initial work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73tmh2w12g8b74ajv4jcxt))\n- Most data practitioners live out of a few tables in the data warehouse and know them well. However, if there are tables that only one or two people on the team work with, you carry some risk. Forcing team members to actually think about a query just once helps build familiarity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73v21qxst5887h64qedy24))\n- We gave team members about a week to complete it, and then conducted a screen-share to present results, and provide a venue for them to ask clarifying questions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73vp9mvqw07rjjqyc8xxre))\n- Pair programming is when two team members will screenshare or sit at the same computer and work together through a coding exercise ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73whvrs9x4e6y02b2g48d0))\n- Even if the new team members have adequate technical skills, it may take some time to assimilate into your team’s specific workflows and ways of doing things ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73wvwrsmm2npvhd9rpp2vk))\n- Whether it’s a pull request on a version-controlled codebase, a draft of a dashboard, or an analysis about to go out, having a peer review process is likely to improve many different types of deliverables ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx73x60bspjk5gjwmfkw0cw8))\n- This may be the stage where you consider structurally building knowledge redundancy via cross-training.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrb5xbnj59k73wac3ngt09x))\n- Foundation models incentivize homogenization: the same few models are repeatedly reused as the basis for many applications. Such consolidation is a double-edged sword: centralization allows us to concentrate and amortize our efforts (e.g., to improve robustness, to reduce bias) on a small collection of models that can be repeatedly applied across applications to reap these benefits (akin to societal infrastructure), but centralization also pinpoints these models as singular points of failure that can radiate harms (e.g., security risks, inequities) to countless downstream applications.

So how do you go about building a chatbot that knows about your data?\n  The main way of doing this is through a process commonly referred to as \"Retrieval Augmented Generation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwen91s55v4a46at2er3wgqn))\n- the system \"retrieves\" any documents that could be relevant in answering the question, and then passes those documents (along with the original question) to the language model for a \"generation\" step. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwen9d8m93z5q1etfmhctcz8))\n- main way most people - including us at LangChain - have been doing retrieval is by using semantic search. In this process, a numerical vector (an embedding) is calculated for all documents, and those vectors are then stored in a vector database (a database optimized for storing and querying vectors). Incoming queries are then vectorized as well, and the documents retrieved are those who are closest to the query in embedding space. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwenafdb7b4f9crc5vfpscdz))\n- there a lot of different variations in how you do this retrieval step. People want to do things beyond semantic search. To be concrete:\n  • We support two different query methods: one that just optimizes similarity, another with optimizes for [maximal marginal relevance](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jgc/publication/The_Use_MMR_Diversity_Based_LTMIR_1998.pdf).\n  • Users often want to specify metadata filters to filter results before doing semantic search\n  • Other types of indexes, [like graphs](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/indexes/chain_examples/graph_qa.html), have piqued user's interests ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwenb4dkmm30rpmyhn65ejnv))\n- we also realized that people may construct a retriever outside of LangChain - for example OpenAI released their `[ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin)`. We want to make it as easy as possible for people to use whatever retriever they created within LangChain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwenbhg7abqa65kzm793sp28))\n- An index is a data structure that supports efficient searching, and a retriever is the component that uses the index to find and return relevant documents in response to a user's query. The index is a key component that the retriever relies on to perform its function.

Being a machine learning practitioner nowadays requires you to use a myriad of tools such as feature stores, training platforms, infrastructure, streams, etc, to be able to train your models and provide batches of predictions.\n  Now imagine a system being used by a retail company to decide which product to show you based on the probability of you buying it, while they send events to the algorithm to tell it if a shown product has been bought or not. The list of tools needed would keep getting longer.

Repeat the process over hundreds/thousands of events and, in theory, it will converge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxn8jmqxaq0npqsctvdqd61c))\n- First of all, let’s build a simple model using `sklearn` so we can use it as a reference. It will also allow us to validate results while writing our version. Since this is a classification problem, we’ll use the `SGDClassifier` with some special settings to simulate online gradient descent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxn8ktatz2bjky2w6d4fqky5))\n- Stochastic gradient descent with mini-batches is essentially the same but instead of going sample by sample, a batch of N samples is processed in each step. The algorithm described in pseudo-code is basically:\n  1. Initialize the weights 𝑤\n  2. Iterate over all samples in batches of size b:\n  3.

Given a set of sentences, we can search using a *‘query’* sentence and identify the most similar records. Enables search to be performed on concepts (rather than specific words).

The first model for *encoding* the original language to a *context vector*, and a second model for *decoding* this into the target language.\n  ![Encoder decoder bottleneck](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/68304720e137ea713a3e69c2a6b4c330ad2e9ebd/2d043/images/sentence-embeddings-2.jpg) Encoder-decoder architecture with the single context vector shared between the two models, this acts as an information bottleneck as *all* information must be passed through this point.\n  The problem here is that we create an *information bottleneck* between the two models. We’re creating a massive amount of information over multiple time steps and trying to squeeze it all through a single connection. This limits the encoder-decoder performance because much of the information produced by the encoder is lost before reaching the decoder.

This meant that we would pass two sentences to BERT, add a classification head to the top of BERT — and use this to output a similarity score. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt9va9dadn748r0dh2jnef1p))\n- The cross-encoder network does produce very accurate similarity scores (better than SBERT), but it’s *not scalable*. I ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt9vaj4ene20ryca3fh3skhf))\n- Ideally, we need to pre-compute sentence vectors that can be stored and then used whenever required. If these vector representations are good, all we need to do is calculate the cosine similarity between each.\n  With the original BERT (and other transformers), we can build a sentence embedding by averaging the values across all token embeddings output by BERT (if we input 512 tokens, we output 512 embeddings). Alternatively, we can use the output of the first `[CLS]` token (a BERT-specific token whose output embedding is used in classification tasks).

(If you want to change company behavior, change the behavior first, and document it second.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grq0da0fwjwcpwd7t32ft3x7))\n- While you should try to avoid useless values, as long as they’re honest, they tend to be inert rather than harmful, so I wouldn’t spend too much time fighting against, particularly them if you’re working on values as a participant (e.g. for the company) rather than as the final decider (e.g. for engineering). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grq0nqajnkwxx6hd92g55hqb))\n- The best way to think of the relationship between values and a strategy (business, technology, or otherwise) is that useful values generally can serve as a strategy’s guiding principle. Not all guiding principles are values (e.g. how you respond to a current market opportunity is unlikely to be a value), but most values are viable guiding principles. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grq0pev7118dw6a0k183bhme))\n- Establishing values should follow [the general patterns of good process rollout](https://lethain.com/good-process-is-evolved/): identify the opportunity, document potential options, involve stakeholders early to build buy-in, test before finalizing to avoid folks feeling trapped, and iterate until it’s useful. It’s easy to announce values, but much harder to introduce values that get used. Reduce that risk by including the wider team, listening, and iterating a few times to make them feel like a shared creation rather than a top-down one.

Instead of asking how much time it will take to do some work, we ask: How much time do we want to spend? How much is this idea worth? This is the task of shaping: narrowing down the problem and designing the outline of a solution that fits within the constraints of our appetite. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre7xrpjam85z5by8p85rvqk))\n- we give full responsibility to a small integrated team of designers and programmers. They define their own tasks, make adjustments to the scope, and work together to build vertical slices of the product one at a time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre7yr6wz7hrph5q431cx0gq))\n- When teams are more autonomous, senior people can spend less time managing them. With less time spent on management, senior people can shape up better projects. When projects are better shaped, teams have clearer boundaries and so can work more autonomously. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre82mjb23vtt4n78z5tqn43))\n- At every step of the process we target a specific risk: the risk of not shipping on time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre867pa57xb4bfg6k6wzk77))\n- Improving your discovery process should come after regaining your ability to ship. You can have the best strategy in the world, but if you can’t act on it, what good does it do? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre84dt3aqyw36ghr8skxxq5))\n- We reduce risk in the planning process by capping our bets to six weeks. If a project runs over, by default it doesn’t get an extension. This “circuit breaker” ensures that we don’t invest multiples of the original appetite on a concept that needs rethinking first. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre85xex8h27bxef9vdkqbm1))\n- we reduce risk in the building process by integrating design and programming early. Instead of building lots of disconnected parts and hoping they’ll fit together in the 11th hour, we build one meaningful piece of the work end-to-end early on and then repeat. The team sequences the work from the most unknown to the least worrisome pieces and learns what works and what doesn’t by integrating as soon as possible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre87cdpvsvf66xhbexzscwn))\n- When we shape the work, we need to do it at the right level of abstraction: not too vague and not too concrete. Product managers often err on one of these two extremes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre8fmgc1pmfgnckqvnnbkyg))\n- Over-specifying the design also leads to estimation errors. Counterintuitive as it may seem, the more specific the work is, the harder it can be to estimate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre8gabx7bwh55q3cqm3dsym))\n    - Note: This might be one of the major flaws of waterfall\n- When the scope isn’t variable, the team can’t reconsider a design decision that is turning out to cost more than it’s worth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre8hxpzf8xrzzk6b8g5vbvw))\n- projects that are too vague don’t work either. When a project is defined in a few words, nobody knows what it means. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre8p97p4jbpkjkjcan2vjb1))\n- Team members don’t have enough information to make trade-offs. They don’t know what to include or leave out ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre8pqy5menm7ewnf8rc3cy8))\n- under-specified projects naturally grow out of control because there’s no boundary to define what’s out of scope. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre8q1dxck6g3mf5xbd96bba))\n- Work in the shaping stage is rough. Everyone can tell by looking at it that it’s unfinished. They can see the open spaces where their contributions will go. Work that’s too fine, too early commits\n  24 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs082s5vnn56g601jmt1de9v))\n- everyone to the wrong details. Designers and programmers need room to apply their own judgement and expertise when they roll up their sleeves and discover all the real trade-offs that emerge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs082vgw6h7gb6vmq3fttex1))\n- Despite being rough and unfinished, shaped work has been thought through. All the main elements of the solution are there at the macro level and they connect together. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs083af3z422a77hfmcp1fcw))\n- shaped work indicates what not to do. It tells the team where to stop. There’s a specific appetite—the amount of time the team is allowed to spend on the project. Completing the project within that fixed amount of time requires limiting the scope and leaving specific things out ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0844yyh61ycz9dzcy3f2xs))\n- Shaping is a closed-door, creative process. You might be alone sketching on paper or in front of a whiteboard with a close collaborator. There’ll be rough diagrams in front of you that nobody outside the room would be able to interpret. When working with a collaborator, you move fast, speak frankly and jump from one promising position to another. It’s that kind of private, rough, early work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs08pwhjh29qd5h6exedm90n))\n- You can’t really schedule shaping work because, by its very nature, unshaped work is risky and unknown. For that reason we have two separate tracks: one for shaping, one for building. During any six week cycle, the teams are building work that’s been previously shaped and the shapers are working on what the teams might potentially build in a future cycle. Work on the shaping track is kept private and not shared with the wider team until the commitment\n  26 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs08r64pxb8bwzaq4t6b1vrs))\n- has been made to bet on it. That gives the shapers the option to put work-in-progress on the shelf or drop it when it’s not working out.

Alpaca behaves similarly to OpenAI’s text-davinci-003, while being surprisingly small and easy/cheap to reproduce (\u003c600$) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfn3vbfxx2g9xtqr0shj0ae))\n- One of the great innovations from OpenAI was their application of [instruction tuning](https://openai.com/research/instruction-following) to GPT-3: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfn4pc6nn1kf1tr59at6cse))\n- On prompts submitted by our customers to the API, our labelers provide demonstrations of the desired model behavior, and rank several outputs from our models. We then use this data to fine-tune GPT-3. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfn4jqsraz7caj723k84mjr))\n- Prior to this, you had to think very carefully about how to construct your prompts. Thanks to instruction tuning you can be a lot more, well, human in the way you interact with the model. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfn55vkwrjkgp4tevpwkbnh))\n- Keep in mind these models are not finetuned for question answering. As such, they should be prompted so that the expected answer is the natural continuation of the prompt. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfn5gd6vc0hebd37hqzbssg))\n- Thanks to the team at Stanford we now have an answer: 52,000 training samples and $100 of training compute! From their blog post: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfn5t8e7k7apcqkagy5e7k6))\n- Something that stuns me about Alpaca is the quality they claim to be able to get from the 7B model—the smallest of the LLaMA models, and the one which has been seen running (albeit glacially slowly) on a RaspberryPi and a mobile phone! Here’s one example from their announcement: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfn65p90ytzbzjevhzecz0p))\n- We emphasize that Alpaca is intended **only for academic research** and any **commercial use is prohibited**. There are three factors in this decision: First, Alpaca is based on LLaMA, which has a non-commercial [license](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqNECQnMkycAp2jP4Z9TFX0cGR4uf7b_fBxjY_OjhJILlKGA/viewform), so we necessarily inherit this decision. Second, the instruction data is based OpenAI’s text-davinci-003, whose [terms of use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use) prohibit developing models that compete with OpenAI. Finally, we have not designed adequate safety measures, so Alpaca is not ready to be deployed for general use. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfn6w4rm489rw619dz4njv3))\n- Those 52,000 samples they used to fine-tune the model? Those were the result of a prompt they ran against GPT-3 itself! Here’s [the prompt](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/blob/da37bb2ecab37cae022dd07aa3ff861c446fb614/prompt.txt) they used: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfn8yar4jb3t3n2rnfq9m5z))\n- Then they include three random example instructions from [a list of 175](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/blob/da37bb2ecab37cae022dd07aa3ff861c446fb614/seed_tasks.jsonl) they had prepared by hand. The completed prompt sent to OpenAI would include the above instructions followed by something like this ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfn9c4ta3hh5q2gdnezbt19))\n- They spent $500 on OpenAI credits to assemble the 52,000 examples they used to fine-tune their model. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvfna517kgrt5t2d1jve66s5))\n- There’s a related concept to this called [Model Extraction](https://ssg.aalto.fi/research/projects/mlsec/model-extraction/), where people build new models that emulate the behaviour of others by firing large numbers of examples through the other model and training a new one based on the results.

Intel, for example, when it was still focused on producing DRAM memory chips rather than microprocessors, made a rule that production capacity would be allocated to products according to several criteria, particularly margin per wafer. This objective formula was designed when no concrete decisions were yet at stake. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxvf6ck28qscgb7r5rnye31r))\n- Preference for completion.

Dissenters often believe that they alone have reservations about a course of action; as a consequence, they remain silent. Others, meanwhile, interpret their silence as agreement. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxvf2t24trzw2k3wersz1kq6))\n- instead of leaving the decision to a small number of top managers, this decision rule tapped into the collective wisdom of the company’s highly knowledgeable onthe-ground executives. When we asked the company’s CEO why he didn’t\n  just make these investment decisions himself, he replied, “Why would I know any better than all the other very experienced television executives in my firm? It is not my job to make the decision; it is my job to make sure the best decision gets made.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxvf8ex2z13dxngj4fnpq44m))\n- Companies that have doubled down on a failing strategy are usually not without dissenters. The trouble is that dissenters can be ruthlessly suppressed—and the knowledge that this might happen itself acts as a suppressant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxvfb8h64xexfv3amxp3f8b3))\n- Consider the following situation: The three members of a top management team are debating whether to continue investing in the company’s current technology or switch to a new one. They agree that two criteria are relevant: (1) whether the current technology is likely to require substantial additional investment; (2) whether the new technology is likely to improve significantly over time. They also agree that they should switch only if it appears that both criteria are met. Let’s suppose that Team Member 1 thinks that\n  both criteria are met, Member 2 thinks that only the first is met, and Member 3 thinks that only the second is. The team’s recommendation will depend on how those opinions are aggregated. As shown in the exhibit “Rethink How You Count Votes,” if you tally by team member (which academics describe as conjunctively), the team will continue investing in the existing technology, because it’s clear that two out of three members don’t believe both criteria have been met. But if you tally by criterion (disjunctively, in academic jargon), each garners two votes for and only one against, meaning that the company should switch to the new technology. Note that in both situations, the criteria are exactly the same and the team members hold exactly the same opinions. It’s the procedure that makes the difference.

Executives can make dissent safer\n  RETHINK HOW YOU COUNT VOTES\n  A team of three must recommend whether its company should change its core technology. Managers agree that this should happen only if both of two criteria are met. What this team recommends will depend on how the members’ votes are counted.\n  CRITERION #1 FURTHER\n  INVESTMENT IN THE OLD TECHNOLOGY IS NEEDED\n  TEAM MEMBER 1 YES\n  CRITERION #2 THE NEW\n  TECHNOLOGY IS LIKELY TO IMPROVE\n  CONJUNCTIVE PROCEDURE (TALLY BY\n  MEMBER): SWITCH TECHNOLOGIES?\n  YES YES TEAM MEMBER 2 YES NO NO TEAM MEMBER 3 NO YES NO\n  for subordinates by expressing their own doubts about a current strategy. To be sure, leaders are not used to doubting themselves—a situation reinforced by the fact that followers expect them to be decisive and confident. But the payoff for occasionally admitting some fallibility can be significant.

Many of those decisions impact multiple teams (Frontend, Backend) and functions (Engineering, Product, Customer Success, Finance).

In mid-2022, I was so excited about their work that I gave them a challenge: train an artificial intelligence to pass an Advanced Placement biology exam. Make it capable of answering questions that it hasn’t been specifically trained for. (I picked AP Bio because the test is more than a simple regurgitation of scientific facts—it asks you to think critically about biology.)

An agent that understands a particular company will be available for its employees to consult directly and should be part of every meeting so it can answer questions. It can be told to be passive or encouraged to speak up if it has some insight. It will need access to the sales, support, finance, product schedules, and text related to the company.

Both sides have discovered the benefits of having no more than one or two layers between them. The business moves faster. Ideas turn into execution with less friction from heavy processes and endless meetings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvwrwhbpqx45x8khverp9hd2))\n- The focus is on spending less time debating and more time executing.

The overwhelming majority of the bloat comes from process leaders. They implement change and enforce process compliance within the organization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvwrzhbpcjv4fa5d1ydd5akf))\n- People within the company don't put new ideas forward because there are too many layers of bloat between ideas and implementations.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvws3d838y1bqc44knty9ta0))\n- People leaders build the team and develop team members.

They build and implement a strategy that helps teams make value-centric decisions about their functional area. Data and AI strategists and product managers fall into this leadership category. Strategy is process and technology agnostic. That gives people at the frontline ownership of their processes and workflows.

These are the informal, diverse, and creative speech acts we perform in conversations, social gatherings, and text to the group WhatsApp. This is where language evolves.\n  We have designed a system that automates a standardised way of writing. We have codified *la langue* at a specific point in time.\n  What we have left to play with is *la parole*. No language model will be able to keep up with the pace of weird internet lingo and memes. I expect we'll lean into this. Using neologisms, jargon, euphemistic emoji, unusual phrases, ingroup dialects, and memes-of-the-moment will help signal your humanity.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qw4a7944kyzwreqytcgxa))\n- The outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qz3249x4007d6d1x8xfw7))\n- The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence (similar what attention does in [seq2seq models](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qzm559wjvn64wt6dy58h6))\n- As is the case in NLP applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector using an [embedding algorithm](https://medium.com/deeper-learning/glossary-of-deep-learning-word-embedding-f90c3cec34ca). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43bvwwr560weacv3m72s65))\n- The embedding only happens in the bottom-most encoder. The abstraction that is common to all the encoders is that they receive a list of vectors each of the size 512 – In the bottom encoder that would be the word embeddings, but in other encoders, it would be the output of the encoder that’s directly below ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43d82ec8nqmyx1ekqz4vsy))\n- After embedding the words in our input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder.

There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, however, and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while flowing through the feed-forward layer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43e1e3sr81vmzed7k31t8c))\n- an encoder receives a list of vectors as input. It processes this list by passing these vectors into a ‘self-attention’ layer, then into a feed-forward neural network, then sends out the output upwards to the next encoder.

I had personally never came across the concept until reading the Attention is All You Need paper. Let us distill how it works.\n  Say the following sentence is an input sentence we want to translate:\n  ”`The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired`”\n  What does “it” in this sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or to the animal? It’s a simple question to a human, but not as simple to an algorithm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43g439emrv0ppc47107xe6))\n- When the model is processing the word “it”, self-attention allows it to associate “it” with “animal”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gfpbp5215vsfmma0fs0e))\n- As the model processes each word (each position in the input sequence), self attention allows it to look at other positions in the input sequence for clues that can help lead to a better encoding for this word. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gpw4bc4n7f112ta03hft))\n- If you’re familiar with RNNs, think of how maintaining a hidden state allows an RNN to incorporate its representation of previous words/vectors it has processed with the current one it’s processing. Self-attention is the method the Transformer uses to bake the “understanding” of other relevant words into the one we’re currently processing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43h3k8ahj564hz5njbse37))\n- The **first step** in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoder’s input vectors (in this case, the embedding of each word). So for each word, we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. These vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43j1j705y3zjy6nrp5ns5v))\n- Notice that these new vectors are smaller in dimension than the embedding vector. Their dimensionality is 64, while the embedding and encoder input/output vectors have dimensionality of 512. They don’t HAVE to be smaller, this is an architecture choice to make the computation of multiheaded attention (mostly) constant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43jkm0z72sfsdp5262dmsw))\n- What are the “query”, “key”, and “value” vectors? \n  They’re abstractions that are useful for calculating and thinking about attention. Once you proceed with reading how attention is calculated below, you’ll know pretty much all you need to know about the role each of these vectors plays.\n  The **second step** in calculating self-attention is to calculate a score. Say we’re calculating the self-attention for the first word in this example, “Thinking”. We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word. The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kds63qrdqsk5tw2dhknp))\n- The score is calculated by taking the dot product of the query vector with the key vector of the respective word we’re scoring. So if we’re processing the self-attention for the word in position #1, the first score would be the dot product of q1 and k1. The second score would be the dot product of q1 and k2. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ksg4fqem6rse31ga8gav))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self_attention_score.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kvr3434ae2v73chyhv9e))\n- The **third and fourth steps** are to divide the scores by 8 (the square root of the dimension of the key vectors used in the paper – 64. This leads to having more stable gradients. There could be other possible values here, but this is the default), then pass the result through a softmax operation. Softmax normalizes the scores so they’re all positive and add up to 1. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43mggpdphmyfpht1a6s0cy))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention_softmax.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43rg7bw2v9aw5a2hr2f2f8))\n- his softmax score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position. Clearly the word at this position will have the highest softmax score, but sometimes it’s useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the current word. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43n1q3mav0cybysjmsbkt9))\n- The **fifth step** is to multiply each value vector by the softmax score (in preparation to sum them up). The intuition here is to keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on, and drown-out irrelevant words (by multiplying them by tiny numbers like 0.001, for example) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43natm8kn4nej6xgepqh08))\n- The **sixth step** is to sum up the weighted value vectors. This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this position (for the first word). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43r0r605atfm28k8d0qxwc))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-output.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43rjb5qjeebyfdqcaftnz2))\n- That concludes the self-attention calculation. The resulting vector is one we can send along to the feed-forward neural network. In the actual implementation, however, this calculation is done in matrix form for faster processing. So let’s look at that now that we’ve seen the intuition of the calculation on the word level. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43r88wb5xxryx9qmqenvgz))\n- Matrix Calculation of Self-Attention\n  **The first step** is to calculate the Query, Key, and Value matrices. We do that by packing our embeddings into a matrix X, and multiplying it by the weight matrices we’ve trained (WQ, WK, WV). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43s12mtkh4d0g4pvc8m0w5))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ry83pv2qkve5h59a8yw7))\n- **Finally**, since we’re dealing with matrices, we can condense steps two through six in one formula to calculate the outputs of the self-attention layer.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation-2.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ssjaecxkvwnz37dejpyy))\n- The paper further refined the self-attention layer by adding a mechanism called “multi-headed” attention. This improves the performance of the attention layer in two ways:\n  1. It expands the model’s ability to focus on different positions. Yes, in the example above, z1 contains a little bit of every other encoding, but it could be dominated by the actual word itself. If we’re translating a sentence like “The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired”, it would be useful to know which word “it” refers to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43tgjwvw3dkd7fjx70q6by))\n- It gives the attention layer multiple “representation subspaces”. As we’ll see next, with multi-headed attention we have not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/Value weight matrices (the Transformer uses eight attention heads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder). Each of these sets is randomly initialized. Then, after training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a different representation subspace. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43tvg1gt8wkthajz0f75w2))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_qkv.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43v18wvm97ydchy62d2fg7))\n- f we do the same self-attention calculation we outlined above, just eight different times with different weight matrices, we end up with eight different Z matrices\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_z.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43v47h8vhrd36nkabghtxk))\n- This leaves us with a bit of a challenge. The feed-forward layer is not expecting eight matrices – it’s expecting a single matrix (a vector for each word). So we need a way to condense these eight down into a single matrix.\n  How do we do that? We concat the matrices then multiply them by an additional weights matrix WO.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_weight_matrix_o.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43vh72mghvq1ez0345p7tn))\n- That’s pretty much all there is to multi-headed self-attention. It’s quite a handful of matrices, I realize. Let me try to put them all in one visual so we can look at them in one place ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43vw9h0v6s4ys2pk44e428))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_multi-headed_self-attention-recap.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43wyr08hq72r7ntkn6jya2))\n- Now that we have touched upon attention heads, let’s revisit our example from before to see where the different attention heads are focusing as we encode the word “it” in our example sentence:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_2.png) \n  As we encode the word \"it\", one attention head is focusing most on \"the animal\", while another is focusing on \"tired\" -- in a sense, the model's representation of the word \"it\" bakes in some of the representation of both \"animal\" and \"tired\".\n  If we add all the attention heads to the picture, however, things can be harder to interpret:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_3.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43yat77cam7ysnc577vh70))\n- One thing that’s missing from the model as we have described it so far is a way to account for the order of the words in the input sequence.\n  To address this, the transformer adds a vector to each input embedding. These vectors follow a specific pattern that the model learns, which helps it determine the position of each word, or the distance between different words in the sequence. The intuition here is that adding these values to the embeddings provides meaningful distances between the embedding vectors once they’re projected into Q/K/V vectors and during dot-product attention.

If we’re to think of a Transformer of 2 stacked encoders and decoders, it would look something like this:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_3.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4413g6rgtjkqb5vw6brsbw))\n- Now that we’ve covered most of the concepts on the encoder side, we basically know how the components of decoders work as well. But let’s take a look at how they work together.\n  The encoder start by processing the input sequence. The output of the top encoder is then transformed into a set of attention vectors K and V. These are to be used by each decoder in its “encoder-decoder attention” layer which helps the decoder focus on appropriate places in the input sequence: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr441fp3bt80av1s3zq5df63))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_1.gif) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr441tgtwqrtp61jmjh4gr26))\n- The following steps repeat the process until a special symbol is reached indicating the transformer decoder has completed its output. The output of each step is fed to the bottom decoder in the next time step, and the decoders bubble up their decoding results just like the encoders did. And just like we did with the encoder inputs, we embed and add positional encoding to those decoder inputs to indicate the position of each word.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_2.gif) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4422r1a9ggxktc1bjvk6qf))\n- The self attention layers in the decoder operate in a slightly different way than the one in the encoder:\n  In the decoder, the self-attention layer is only allowed to attend to earlier positions in the output sequence. This is done by masking future positions (setting them to `-inf`) before the softmax step in the self-attention calculation.\n  The “Encoder-Decoder Attention” layer works just like multiheaded self-attention, except it creates its Queries matrix from the layer below it, and takes the Keys and Values matrix from the output of the encoder stack. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr442gq9g1s6t401zvnszsbg))\n- The decoder stack outputs a vector of floats. How do we turn that into a word? That’s the job of the final Linear layer which is followed by a Softmax Layer.\n  The Linear layer is a simple fully connected neural network that projects the vector produced by the stack of decoders, into a much, much larger vector called a logits vector.\n  Let’s assume that our model knows 10,000 unique English words (our model’s “output vocabulary”) that it’s learned from its training dataset. This would make the logits vector 10,000 cells wide – each cell corresponding to the score of a unique word. That is how we interpret the output of the model followed by the Linear layer.\n  The softmax layer then turns those scores into probabilities (all positive, all add up to 1.0). The cell with the highest probability is chosen, and the word associated with it is produced as the output for this time step. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4436kday4y5drby2w9f7tc))\n- Now that we’ve covered the entire forward-pass process through a trained Transformer, it would be useful to glance at the intuition of training the model.\n  During training, an untrained model would go through the exact same forward pass. But since we are training it on a labeled training dataset, we can compare its output with the actual correct output.\n  To visualize this, let’s assume our output vocabulary only contains six words(“a”, “am”, “i”, “thanks”, “student”, and “\u003ceos\u003e” (short for ‘end of sentence’)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr443x9f8v1vp5wr32c61w5n))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/vocabulary.png) \n  The output vocabulary of our model is created in the preprocessing phase before we even begin training. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444rwtqjn4t79nrm00egbd))\n- Once we define our output vocabulary, we can use a vector of the same width to indicate each word in our vocabulary. This also known as one-hot encoding. So for example, we can indicate the word “am” using the following vector: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444akq9ps9fbk8fbx68zxy))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/one-hot-vocabulary-example.png) \n  Example: one-hot encoding of our output vocabulary ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444ptpa7ancdtj89zmjjd6))\n- The Loss Function\n  Say we are training our model. Say it’s our first step in the training phase, and we’re training it on a simple example – translating “merci” into “thanks”.\n  What this means, is that we want the output to be a probability distribution indicating the word “thanks”. But since this model is not yet trained, that’s unlikely to happen just yet.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_logits_output_and_label.png) \n  Since the model's parameters (weights) are all initialized randomly, the (untrained) model produces a probability distribution with arbitrary values for each cell/word. We can compare it with the actual output, then tweak all the model's weights using backpropagation to make the output closer to the desired output. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr445m67n0aw8x514vrk2xb3))\n- But note that this is an oversimplified example. More realistically, we’ll use a sentence longer than one word. For example – input: “je suis étudiant” and expected output: “i am a student”. What this really means, is that we want our model to successively output probability distributions where:\n  • Each probability distribution is represented by a vector of width vocab_size (6 in our toy example, but more realistically a number like 30,000 or 50,000)\n  • The first probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “i”\n  • The second probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “am”\n  • And so on, until the fifth output distribution indicates ‘`\u003cend of sentence\u003e`’ symbol, which also has a cell associated with it from the 10,000 element vocabulary.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/output_target_probability_distributions.png) \n  The targeted probability distributions we'll train our model against in the training example for one sample sentence.

The decoding component is a stack of decoders of the same number. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qk5rmh11jv8tv46g88tj0))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/The_transformer_encoder_decoder_stack.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43f9jzt5sdzyb5ypzdf2yj))\n- The encoders are all identical in structure (yet they do not share weights). Each one is broken down into two sub-layers: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qrd7fxt1ac4aax6454rbd))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/Transformer_encoder.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43fbszx7j24ha1e5p8zg9d))\n- The encoder’s inputs first flow through a self-attention layer – a layer that helps the encoder look at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qw4a7944kyzwreqytcgxa))\n- The outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qz3249x4007d6d1x8xfw7))\n- The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence (similar what attention does in [seq2seq models](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qzm559wjvn64wt6dy58h6))\n- As is the case in NLP applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector using an [embedding algorithm](https://medium.com/deeper-learning/glossary-of-deep-learning-word-embedding-f90c3cec34ca). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43bvwwr560weacv3m72s65))\n- The embedding only happens in the bottom-most encoder. The abstraction that is common to all the encoders is that they receive a list of vectors each of the size 512 – In the bottom encoder that would be the word embeddings, but in other encoders, it would be the output of the encoder that’s directly below ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43d82ec8nqmyx1ekqz4vsy))\n- After embedding the words in our input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43dgprrxmmp295nfatw7b8))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/encoder_with_tensors.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43f6g9wexr7kmntykvhkqx))\n- Here we begin to see one key property of the Transformer, which is that the word in each position flows through its own path in the encoder. There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, however, and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while flowing through the feed-forward layer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43e1e3sr81vmzed7k31t8c))\n- an encoder receives a list of vectors as input. It processes this list by passing these vectors into a ‘self-attention’ layer, then into a feed-forward neural network, then sends out the output upwards to the next encoder. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43eta1s6v2v9pdpyatfym1))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/encoder_with_tensors_2.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43f21wkg3842np67vch8mj))\n- Don’t be fooled by me throwing around the word “self-attention” like it’s a concept everyone should be familiar with. I had personally never came across the concept until reading the Attention is All You Need paper. Let us distill how it works.\n  Say the following sentence is an input sentence we want to translate:\n  ”`The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired`”\n  What does “it” in this sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or to the animal? It’s a simple question to a human, but not as simple to an algorithm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43g439emrv0ppc47107xe6))\n- When the model is processing the word “it”, self-attention allows it to associate “it” with “animal”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gfpbp5215vsfmma0fs0e))\n- As the model processes each word (each position in the input sequence), self attention allows it to look at other positions in the input sequence for clues that can help lead to a better encoding for this word. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gpw4bc4n7f112ta03hft))\n- If you’re familiar with RNNs, think of how maintaining a hidden state allows an RNN to incorporate its representation of previous words/vectors it has processed with the current one it’s processing. Self-attention is the method the Transformer uses to bake the “understanding” of other relevant words into the one we’re currently processing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43h3k8ahj564hz5njbse37))\n- The **first step** in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoder’s input vectors (in this case, the embedding of each word). So for each word, we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. These vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43j1j705y3zjy6nrp5ns5v))\n- Notice that these new vectors are smaller in dimension than the embedding vector. Their dimensionality is 64, while the embedding and encoder input/output vectors have dimensionality of 512. They don’t HAVE to be smaller, this is an architecture choice to make the computation of multiheaded attention (mostly) constant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43jkm0z72sfsdp5262dmsw))\n- What are the “query”, “key”, and “value” vectors? \n  They’re abstractions that are useful for calculating and thinking about attention. Once you proceed with reading how attention is calculated below, you’ll know pretty much all you need to know about the role each of these vectors plays.\n  The **second step** in calculating self-attention is to calculate a score. Say we’re calculating the self-attention for the first word in this example, “Thinking”. We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word. The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kds63qrdqsk5tw2dhknp))\n- The score is calculated by taking the dot product of the query vector with the key vector of the respective word we’re scoring. So if we’re processing the self-attention for the word in position #1, the first score would be the dot product of q1 and k1. The second score would be the dot product of q1 and k2. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ksg4fqem6rse31ga8gav))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self_attention_score.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kvr3434ae2v73chyhv9e))\n- The **third and fourth steps** are to divide the scores by 8 (the square root of the dimension of the key vectors used in the paper – 64. This leads to having more stable gradients. There could be other possible values here, but this is the default), then pass the result through a softmax operation. Softmax normalizes the scores so they’re all positive and add up to 1. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43mggpdphmyfpht1a6s0cy))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention_softmax.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43rg7bw2v9aw5a2hr2f2f8))\n- his softmax score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position. Clearly the word at this position will have the highest softmax score, but sometimes it’s useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the current word. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43n1q3mav0cybysjmsbkt9))\n- The **fifth step** is to multiply each value vector by the softmax score (in preparation to sum them up). The intuition here is to keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on, and drown-out irrelevant words (by multiplying them by tiny numbers like 0.001, for example) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43natm8kn4nej6xgepqh08))\n- The **sixth step** is to sum up the weighted value vectors. This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this position (for the first word). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43r0r605atfm28k8d0qxwc))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-output.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43rjb5qjeebyfdqcaftnz2))\n- That concludes the self-attention calculation. The resulting vector is one we can send along to the feed-forward neural network. In the actual implementation, however, this calculation is done in matrix form for faster processing. So let’s look at that now that we’ve seen the intuition of the calculation on the word level. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43r88wb5xxryx9qmqenvgz))\n- Matrix Calculation of Self-Attention\n  **The first step** is to calculate the Query, Key, and Value matrices. We do that by packing our embeddings into a matrix X, and multiplying it by the weight matrices we’ve trained (WQ, WK, WV). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43s12mtkh4d0g4pvc8m0w5))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ry83pv2qkve5h59a8yw7))\n- **Finally**, since we’re dealing with matrices, we can condense steps two through six in one formula to calculate the outputs of the self-attention layer.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation-2.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ssjaecxkvwnz37dejpyy))\n- The paper further refined the self-attention layer by adding a mechanism called “multi-headed” attention. This improves the performance of the attention layer in two ways:\n  1. It expands the model’s ability to focus on different positions. Yes, in the example above, z1 contains a little bit of every other encoding, but it could be dominated by the actual word itself. If we’re translating a sentence like “The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired”, it would be useful to know which word “it” refers to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43tgjwvw3dkd7fjx70q6by))\n- It gives the attention layer multiple “representation subspaces”. As we’ll see next, with multi-headed attention we have not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/Value weight matrices (the Transformer uses eight attention heads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder). Each of these sets is randomly initialized. Then, after training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a different representation subspace. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43tvg1gt8wkthajz0f75w2))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_qkv.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43v18wvm97ydchy62d2fg7))\n- f we do the same self-attention calculation we outlined above, just eight different times with different weight matrices, we end up with eight different Z matrices\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_z.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43v47h8vhrd36nkabghtxk))\n- This leaves us with a bit of a challenge. The feed-forward layer is not expecting eight matrices – it’s expecting a single matrix (a vector for each word). So we need a way to condense these eight down into a single matrix.\n  How do we do that? We concat the matrices then multiply them by an additional weights matrix WO.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_weight_matrix_o.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43vh72mghvq1ez0345p7tn))\n- That’s pretty much all there is to multi-headed self-attention. It’s quite a handful of matrices, I realize. Let me try to put them all in one visual so we can look at them in one place ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43vw9h0v6s4ys2pk44e428))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_multi-headed_self-attention-recap.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43wyr08hq72r7ntkn6jya2))\n- Now that we have touched upon attention heads, let’s revisit our example from before to see where the different attention heads are focusing as we encode the word “it” in our example sentence:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_2.png) \n  As we encode the word \"it\", one attention head is focusing most on \"the animal\", while another is focusing on \"tired\" -- in a sense, the model's representation of the word \"it\" bakes in some of the representation of both \"animal\" and \"tired\".\n  If we add all the attention heads to the picture, however, things can be harder to interpret:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_3.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43yat77cam7ysnc577vh70))\n- One thing that’s missing from the model as we have described it so far is a way to account for the order of the words in the input sequence.\n  To address this, the transformer adds a vector to each input embedding. These vectors follow a specific pattern that the model learns, which helps it determine the position of each word, or the distance between different words in the sequence. The intuition here is that adding these values to the embeddings provides meaningful distances between the embedding vectors once they’re projected into Q/K/V vectors and during dot-product attention. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43yyj61gv31j0syr73xyga))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_vectors.png) \n  To give the model a sense of the order of the words, we add positional encoding vectors -- the values of which follow a specific pattern.\n  If we assumed the embedding has a dimensionality of 4, the actual positional encodings would look like this:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_example.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43znch1bsfjnb2b928qek7))\n- One detail in the architecture of the encoder that we need to mention before moving on, is that each sub-layer (self-attention, ffnn) in each encoder has a residual connection around it, and is followed by a [layer-normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450) step.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr440f4v2m98ewn3esstkrv8))\n- If we’re to visualize the vectors and the layer-norm operation associated with self attention, it would look like this:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_2.png) \n  This goes for the sub-layers of the decoder as well.

This would make the logits vector 10,000 cells wide – each cell corresponding to the score of a unique word. That is how we interpret the output of the model followed by the Linear layer.\n  The softmax layer then turns those scores into probabilities (all positive, all add up to 1.0). The cell with the highest probability is chosen, and the word associated with it is produced as the output for this time step.

But since we are training it on a labeled training dataset, we can compare its output with the actual correct output.\n  To visualize this, let’s assume our output vocabulary only contains six words(“a”, “am”, “i”, “thanks”, “student”, and “\u003ceos\u003e” (short for ‘end of sentence’)).

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qw4a7944kyzwreqytcgxa))\n- The outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qz3249x4007d6d1x8xfw7))\n- The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence (similar what attention does in [seq2seq models](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qzm559wjvn64wt6dy58h6))\n- As is the case in NLP applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector using an [embedding algorithm](https://medium.com/deeper-learning/glossary-of-deep-learning-word-embedding-f90c3cec34ca). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43bvwwr560weacv3m72s65))\n- The embedding only happens in the bottom-most encoder. The abstraction that is common to all the encoders is that they receive a list of vectors each of the size 512 – In the bottom encoder that would be the word embeddings, but in other encoders, it would be the output of the encoder that’s directly below ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43d82ec8nqmyx1ekqz4vsy))\n- After embedding the words in our input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder.

There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, however, and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while flowing through the feed-forward layer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43e1e3sr81vmzed7k31t8c))\n- an encoder receives a list of vectors as input. It processes this list by passing these vectors into a ‘self-attention’ layer, then into a feed-forward neural network, then sends out the output upwards to the next encoder.

I had personally never came across the concept until reading the Attention is All You Need paper. Let us distill how it works.\n  Say the following sentence is an input sentence we want to translate:\n  ”`The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired`”\n  What does “it” in this sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or to the animal? It’s a simple question to a human, but not as simple to an algorithm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43g439emrv0ppc47107xe6))\n- When the model is processing the word “it”, self-attention allows it to associate “it” with “animal”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gfpbp5215vsfmma0fs0e))\n- As the model processes each word (each position in the input sequence), self attention allows it to look at other positions in the input sequence for clues that can help lead to a better encoding for this word. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gpw4bc4n7f112ta03hft))\n- If you’re familiar with RNNs, think of how maintaining a hidden state allows an RNN to incorporate its representation of previous words/vectors it has processed with the current one it’s processing. Self-attention is the method the Transformer uses to bake the “understanding” of other relevant words into the one we’re currently processing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43h3k8ahj564hz5njbse37))\n- The **first step** in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoder’s input vectors (in this case, the embedding of each word). So for each word, we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. These vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43j1j705y3zjy6nrp5ns5v))\n- Notice that these new vectors are smaller in dimension than the embedding vector. Their dimensionality is 64, while the embedding and encoder input/output vectors have dimensionality of 512. They don’t HAVE to be smaller, this is an architecture choice to make the computation of multiheaded attention (mostly) constant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43jkm0z72sfsdp5262dmsw))\n- What are the “query”, “key”, and “value” vectors? \n  They’re abstractions that are useful for calculating and thinking about attention. Once you proceed with reading how attention is calculated below, you’ll know pretty much all you need to know about the role each of these vectors plays.\n  The **second step** in calculating self-attention is to calculate a score. Say we’re calculating the self-attention for the first word in this example, “Thinking”. We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word. The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kds63qrdqsk5tw2dhknp))\n- The score is calculated by taking the dot product of the query vector with the key vector of the respective word we’re scoring. So if we’re processing the self-attention for the word in position #1, the first score would be the dot product of q1 and k1. The second score would be the dot product of q1 and k2. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ksg4fqem6rse31ga8gav))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self_attention_score.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kvr3434ae2v73chyhv9e))\n- The **third and fourth steps** are to divide the scores by 8 (the square root of the dimension of the key vectors used in the paper – 64. This leads to having more stable gradients. There could be other possible values here, but this is the default), then pass the result through a softmax operation. Softmax normalizes the scores so they’re all positive and add up to 1. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43mggpdphmyfpht1a6s0cy))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention_softmax.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43rg7bw2v9aw5a2hr2f2f8))\n- his softmax score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position. Clearly the word at this position will have the highest softmax score, but sometimes it’s useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the current word. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43n1q3mav0cybysjmsbkt9))\n- The **fifth step** is to multiply each value vector by the softmax score (in preparation to sum them up). The intuition here is to keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on, and drown-out irrelevant words (by multiplying them by tiny numbers like 0.001, for example) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43natm8kn4nej6xgepqh08))\n- The **sixth step** is to sum up the weighted value vectors. This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this position (for the first word). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43r0r605atfm28k8d0qxwc))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-output.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43rjb5qjeebyfdqcaftnz2))\n- That concludes the self-attention calculation. The resulting vector is one we can send along to the feed-forward neural network. In the actual implementation, however, this calculation is done in matrix form for faster processing. So let’s look at that now that we’ve seen the intuition of the calculation on the word level. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43r88wb5xxryx9qmqenvgz))\n- Matrix Calculation of Self-Attention\n  **The first step** is to calculate the Query, Key, and Value matrices. We do that by packing our embeddings into a matrix X, and multiplying it by the weight matrices we’ve trained (WQ, WK, WV). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43s12mtkh4d0g4pvc8m0w5))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ry83pv2qkve5h59a8yw7))\n- **Finally**, since we’re dealing with matrices, we can condense steps two through six in one formula to calculate the outputs of the self-attention layer.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation-2.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ssjaecxkvwnz37dejpyy))\n- The paper further refined the self-attention layer by adding a mechanism called “multi-headed” attention. This improves the performance of the attention layer in two ways:\n  1. It expands the model’s ability to focus on different positions. Yes, in the example above, z1 contains a little bit of every other encoding, but it could be dominated by the actual word itself. If we’re translating a sentence like “The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired”, it would be useful to know which word “it” refers to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43tgjwvw3dkd7fjx70q6by))\n- It gives the attention layer multiple “representation subspaces”. As we’ll see next, with multi-headed attention we have not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/Value weight matrices (the Transformer uses eight attention heads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder). Each of these sets is randomly initialized. Then, after training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a different representation subspace. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43tvg1gt8wkthajz0f75w2))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_qkv.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43v18wvm97ydchy62d2fg7))\n- f we do the same self-attention calculation we outlined above, just eight different times with different weight matrices, we end up with eight different Z matrices\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_z.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43v47h8vhrd36nkabghtxk))\n- This leaves us with a bit of a challenge. The feed-forward layer is not expecting eight matrices – it’s expecting a single matrix (a vector for each word). So we need a way to condense these eight down into a single matrix.\n  How do we do that? We concat the matrices then multiply them by an additional weights matrix WO.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_weight_matrix_o.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43vh72mghvq1ez0345p7tn))\n- That’s pretty much all there is to multi-headed self-attention. It’s quite a handful of matrices, I realize. Let me try to put them all in one visual so we can look at them in one place ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43vw9h0v6s4ys2pk44e428))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_multi-headed_self-attention-recap.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43wyr08hq72r7ntkn6jya2))\n- Now that we have touched upon attention heads, let’s revisit our example from before to see where the different attention heads are focusing as we encode the word “it” in our example sentence:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_2.png) \n  As we encode the word \"it\", one attention head is focusing most on \"the animal\", while another is focusing on \"tired\" -- in a sense, the model's representation of the word \"it\" bakes in some of the representation of both \"animal\" and \"tired\".\n  If we add all the attention heads to the picture, however, things can be harder to interpret:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_3.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43yat77cam7ysnc577vh70))\n- One thing that’s missing from the model as we have described it so far is a way to account for the order of the words in the input sequence.\n  To address this, the transformer adds a vector to each input embedding. These vectors follow a specific pattern that the model learns, which helps it determine the position of each word, or the distance between different words in the sequence. The intuition here is that adding these values to the embeddings provides meaningful distances between the embedding vectors once they’re projected into Q/K/V vectors and during dot-product attention. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43yyj61gv31j0syr73xyga))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_vectors.png) \n  To give the model a sense of the order of the words, we add positional encoding vectors -- the values of which follow a specific pattern.\n  If we assumed the embedding has a dimensionality of 4, the actual positional encodings would look like this:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_example.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43znch1bsfjnb2b928qek7))\n- One detail in the architecture of the encoder that we need to mention before moving on, is that each sub-layer (self-attention, ffnn) in each encoder has a residual connection around it, and is followed by a [layer-normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450) step.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr440f4v2m98ewn3esstkrv8))\n- If we’re to visualize the vectors and the layer-norm operation associated with self attention, it would look like this:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_2.png) \n  This goes for the sub-layers of the decoder as well. If we’re to think of a Transformer of 2 stacked encoders and decoders, it would look something like this:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_3.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4413g6rgtjkqb5vw6brsbw))\n- Now that we’ve covered most of the concepts on the encoder side, we basically know how the components of decoders work as well. But let’s take a look at how they work together.\n  The encoder start by processing the input sequence. The output of the top encoder is then transformed into a set of attention vectors K and V. These are to be used by each decoder in its “encoder-decoder attention” layer which helps the decoder focus on appropriate places in the input sequence: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr441fp3bt80av1s3zq5df63))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_1.gif) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr441tgtwqrtp61jmjh4gr26))\n- The following steps repeat the process until a special symbol is reached indicating the transformer decoder has completed its output. The output of each step is fed to the bottom decoder in the next time step, and the decoders bubble up their decoding results just like the encoders did. And just like we did with the encoder inputs, we embed and add positional encoding to those decoder inputs to indicate the position of each word.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_2.gif) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4422r1a9ggxktc1bjvk6qf))\n- The self attention layers in the decoder operate in a slightly different way than the one in the encoder:\n  In the decoder, the self-attention layer is only allowed to attend to earlier positions in the output sequence. This is done by masking future positions (setting them to `-inf`) before the softmax step in the self-attention calculation.\n  The “Encoder-Decoder Attention” layer works just like multiheaded self-attention, except it creates its Queries matrix from the layer below it, and takes the Keys and Values matrix from the output of the encoder stack. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr442gq9g1s6t401zvnszsbg))\n- The decoder stack outputs a vector of floats. How do we turn that into a word? That’s the job of the final Linear layer which is followed by a Softmax Layer.\n  The Linear layer is a simple fully connected neural network that projects the vector produced by the stack of decoders, into a much, much larger vector called a logits vector.\n  Let’s assume that our model knows 10,000 unique English words (our model’s “output vocabulary”) that it’s learned from its training dataset. This would make the logits vector 10,000 cells wide – each cell corresponding to the score of a unique word. That is how we interpret the output of the model followed by the Linear layer.\n  The softmax layer then turns those scores into probabilities (all positive, all add up to 1.0). The cell with the highest probability is chosen, and the word associated with it is produced as the output for this time step. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4436kday4y5drby2w9f7tc))\n- Now that we’ve covered the entire forward-pass process through a trained Transformer, it would be useful to glance at the intuition of training the model.\n  During training, an untrained model would go through the exact same forward pass. But since we are training it on a labeled training dataset, we can compare its output with the actual correct output.\n  To visualize this, let’s assume our output vocabulary only contains six words(“a”, “am”, “i”, “thanks”, “student”, and “\u003ceos\u003e” (short for ‘end of sentence’)).

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qw4a7944kyzwreqytcgxa))\n- The outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qz3249x4007d6d1x8xfw7))\n- The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence (similar what attention does in [seq2seq models](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qzm559wjvn64wt6dy58h6))\n- As is the case in NLP applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector using an [embedding algorithm](https://medium.com/deeper-learning/glossary-of-deep-learning-word-embedding-f90c3cec34ca). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43bvwwr560weacv3m72s65))\n- The embedding only happens in the bottom-most encoder. The abstraction that is common to all the encoders is that they receive a list of vectors each of the size 512 – In the bottom encoder that would be the word embeddings, but in other encoders, it would be the output of the encoder that’s directly below ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43d82ec8nqmyx1ekqz4vsy))\n- After embedding the words in our input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder.

There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, however, and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while flowing through the feed-forward layer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43e1e3sr81vmzed7k31t8c))\n- an encoder receives a list of vectors as input. It processes this list by passing these vectors into a ‘self-attention’ layer, then into a feed-forward neural network, then sends out the output upwards to the next encoder.

I had personally never came across the concept until reading the Attention is All You Need paper. Let us distill how it works.\n  Say the following sentence is an input sentence we want to translate:\n  ”`The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired`”\n  What does “it” in this sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or to the animal? It’s a simple question to a human, but not as simple to an algorithm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43g439emrv0ppc47107xe6))\n- When the model is processing the word “it”, self-attention allows it to associate “it” with “animal”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gfpbp5215vsfmma0fs0e))\n- As the model processes each word (each position in the input sequence), self attention allows it to look at other positions in the input sequence for clues that can help lead to a better encoding for this word. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gpw4bc4n7f112ta03hft))\n- If you’re familiar with RNNs, think of how maintaining a hidden state allows an RNN to incorporate its representation of previous words/vectors it has processed with the current one it’s processing. Self-attention is the method the Transformer uses to bake the “understanding” of other relevant words into the one we’re currently processing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43h3k8ahj564hz5njbse37))\n- The **first step** in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoder’s input vectors (in this case, the embedding of each word). So for each word, we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. These vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43j1j705y3zjy6nrp5ns5v))\n- Notice that these new vectors are smaller in dimension than the embedding vector. Their dimensionality is 64, while the embedding and encoder input/output vectors have dimensionality of 512. They don’t HAVE to be smaller, this is an architecture choice to make the computation of multiheaded attention (mostly) constant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43jkm0z72sfsdp5262dmsw))\n- What are the “query”, “key”, and “value” vectors? \n  They’re abstractions that are useful for calculating and thinking about attention. Once you proceed with reading how attention is calculated below, you’ll know pretty much all you need to know about the role each of these vectors plays.\n  The **second step** in calculating self-attention is to calculate a score. Say we’re calculating the self-attention for the first word in this example, “Thinking”. We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word. The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kds63qrdqsk5tw2dhknp))\n- The score is calculated by taking the dot product of the query vector with the key vector of the respective word we’re scoring. So if we’re processing the self-attention for the word in position #1, the first score would be the dot product of q1 and k1. The second score would be the dot product of q1 and k2. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ksg4fqem6rse31ga8gav))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self_attention_score.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kvr3434ae2v73chyhv9e))\n- The **third and fourth steps** are to divide the scores by 8 (the square root of the dimension of the key vectors used in the paper – 64. This leads to having more stable gradients. There could be other possible values here, but this is the default), then pass the result through a softmax operation. Softmax normalizes the scores so they’re all positive and add up to 1. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43mggpdphmyfpht1a6s0cy))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention_softmax.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43rg7bw2v9aw5a2hr2f2f8))\n- his softmax score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position. Clearly the word at this position will have the highest softmax score, but sometimes it’s useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the current word. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43n1q3mav0cybysjmsbkt9))\n- The **fifth step** is to multiply each value vector by the softmax score (in preparation to sum them up). The intuition here is to keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on, and drown-out irrelevant words (by multiplying them by tiny numbers like 0.001, for example) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43natm8kn4nej6xgepqh08))\n- The **sixth step** is to sum up the weighted value vectors. This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this position (for the first word). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43r0r605atfm28k8d0qxwc))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-output.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43rjb5qjeebyfdqcaftnz2))\n- That concludes the self-attention calculation. The resulting vector is one we can send along to the feed-forward neural network. In the actual implementation, however, this calculation is done in matrix form for faster processing. So let’s look at that now that we’ve seen the intuition of the calculation on the word level. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43r88wb5xxryx9qmqenvgz))\n- Matrix Calculation of Self-Attention\n  **The first step** is to calculate the Query, Key, and Value matrices. We do that by packing our embeddings into a matrix X, and multiplying it by the weight matrices we’ve trained (WQ, WK, WV). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43s12mtkh4d0g4pvc8m0w5))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ry83pv2qkve5h59a8yw7))\n- **Finally**, since we’re dealing with matrices, we can condense steps two through six in one formula to calculate the outputs of the self-attention layer.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation-2.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ssjaecxkvwnz37dejpyy))\n- The paper further refined the self-attention layer by adding a mechanism called “multi-headed” attention. This improves the performance of the attention layer in two ways:\n  1. It expands the model’s ability to focus on different positions. Yes, in the example above, z1 contains a little bit of every other encoding, but it could be dominated by the actual word itself. If we’re translating a sentence like “The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired”, it would be useful to know which word “it” refers to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43tgjwvw3dkd7fjx70q6by))\n- It gives the attention layer multiple “representation subspaces”. As we’ll see next, with multi-headed attention we have not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/Value weight matrices (the Transformer uses eight attention heads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder). Each of these sets is randomly initialized. Then, after training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a different representation subspace. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43tvg1gt8wkthajz0f75w2))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_qkv.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43v18wvm97ydchy62d2fg7))\n- f we do the same self-attention calculation we outlined above, just eight different times with different weight matrices, we end up with eight different Z matrices\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_z.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43v47h8vhrd36nkabghtxk))\n- This leaves us with a bit of a challenge. The feed-forward layer is not expecting eight matrices – it’s expecting a single matrix (a vector for each word). So we need a way to condense these eight down into a single matrix.\n  How do we do that? We concat the matrices then multiply them by an additional weights matrix WO.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_weight_matrix_o.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43vh72mghvq1ez0345p7tn))\n- That’s pretty much all there is to multi-headed self-attention. It’s quite a handful of matrices, I realize. Let me try to put them all in one visual so we can look at them in one place ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43vw9h0v6s4ys2pk44e428))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_multi-headed_self-attention-recap.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43wyr08hq72r7ntkn6jya2))\n- Now that we have touched upon attention heads, let’s revisit our example from before to see where the different attention heads are focusing as we encode the word “it” in our example sentence:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_2.png) \n  As we encode the word \"it\", one attention head is focusing most on \"the animal\", while another is focusing on \"tired\" -- in a sense, the model's representation of the word \"it\" bakes in some of the representation of both \"animal\" and \"tired\".\n  If we add all the attention heads to the picture, however, things can be harder to interpret:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_3.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43yat77cam7ysnc577vh70))\n- One thing that’s missing from the model as we have described it so far is a way to account for the order of the words in the input sequence.\n  To address this, the transformer adds a vector to each input embedding. These vectors follow a specific pattern that the model learns, which helps it determine the position of each word, or the distance between different words in the sequence. The intuition here is that adding these values to the embeddings provides meaningful distances between the embedding vectors once they’re projected into Q/K/V vectors and during dot-product attention. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43yyj61gv31j0syr73xyga))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_vectors.png) \n  To give the model a sense of the order of the words, we add positional encoding vectors -- the values of which follow a specific pattern.\n  If we assumed the embedding has a dimensionality of 4, the actual positional encodings would look like this:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_example.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43znch1bsfjnb2b928qek7))\n- One detail in the architecture of the encoder that we need to mention before moving on, is that each sub-layer (self-attention, ffnn) in each encoder has a residual connection around it, and is followed by a [layer-normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450) step.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr440f4v2m98ewn3esstkrv8))\n- If we’re to visualize the vectors and the layer-norm operation associated with self attention, it would look like this:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_2.png) \n  This goes for the sub-layers of the decoder as well. If we’re to think of a Transformer of 2 stacked encoders and decoders, it would look something like this:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_3.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4413g6rgtjkqb5vw6brsbw))\n- Now that we’ve covered most of the concepts on the encoder side, we basically know how the components of decoders work as well. But let’s take a look at how they work together.\n  The encoder start by processing the input sequence. The output of the top encoder is then transformed into a set of attention vectors K and V. These are to be used by each decoder in its “encoder-decoder attention” layer which helps the decoder focus on appropriate places in the input sequence: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr441fp3bt80av1s3zq5df63))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_1.gif) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr441tgtwqrtp61jmjh4gr26))\n- The following steps repeat the process until a special symbol is reached indicating the transformer decoder has completed its output. The output of each step is fed to the bottom decoder in the next time step, and the decoders bubble up their decoding results just like the encoders did. And just like we did with the encoder inputs, we embed and add positional encoding to those decoder inputs to indicate the position of each word.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_2.gif) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4422r1a9ggxktc1bjvk6qf))\n- The self attention layers in the decoder operate in a slightly different way than the one in the encoder:\n  In the decoder, the self-attention layer is only allowed to attend to earlier positions in the output sequence. This is done by masking future positions (setting them to `-inf`) before the softmax step in the self-attention calculation.\n  The “Encoder-Decoder Attention” layer works just like multiheaded self-attention, except it creates its Queries matrix from the layer below it, and takes the Keys and Values matrix from the output of the encoder stack. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr442gq9g1s6t401zvnszsbg))\n- The decoder stack outputs a vector of floats. How do we turn that into a word? That’s the job of the final Linear layer which is followed by a Softmax Layer.\n  The Linear layer is a simple fully connected neural network that projects the vector produced by the stack of decoders, into a much, much larger vector called a logits vector.\n  Let’s assume that our model knows 10,000 unique English words (our model’s “output vocabulary”) that it’s learned from its training dataset. This would make the logits vector 10,000 cells wide – each cell corresponding to the score of a unique word. That is how we interpret the output of the model followed by the Linear layer.\n  The softmax layer then turns those scores into probabilities (all positive, all add up to 1.0). The cell with the highest probability is chosen, and the word associated with it is produced as the output for this time step. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4436kday4y5drby2w9f7tc))\n- Now that we’ve covered the entire forward-pass process through a trained Transformer, it would be useful to glance at the intuition of training the model.\n  During training, an untrained model would go through the exact same forward pass. But since we are training it on a labeled training dataset, we can compare its output with the actual correct output.\n  To visualize this, let’s assume our output vocabulary only contains six words(“a”, “am”, “i”, “thanks”, “student”, and “\u003ceos\u003e” (short for ‘end of sentence’)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr443x9f8v1vp5wr32c61w5n))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/vocabulary.png) \n  The output vocabulary of our model is created in the preprocessing phase before we even begin training. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444rwtqjn4t79nrm00egbd))\n- Once we define our output vocabulary, we can use a vector of the same width to indicate each word in our vocabulary. This also known as one-hot encoding. So for example, we can indicate the word “am” using the following vector: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444akq9ps9fbk8fbx68zxy))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/one-hot-vocabulary-example.png) \n  Example: one-hot encoding of our output vocabulary ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444ptpa7ancdtj89zmjjd6))\n- The Loss Function\n  Say we are training our model. Say it’s our first step in the training phase, and we’re training it on a simple example – translating “merci” into “thanks”.\n  What this means, is that we want the output to be a probability distribution indicating the word “thanks”. But since this model is not yet trained, that’s unlikely to happen just yet.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_logits_output_and_label.png) \n  Since the model's parameters (weights) are all initialized randomly, the (untrained) model produces a probability distribution with arbitrary values for each cell/word. We can compare it with the actual output, then tweak all the model's weights using backpropagation to make the output closer to the desired output. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr445m67n0aw8x514vrk2xb3))\n- But note that this is an oversimplified example. More realistically, we’ll use a sentence longer than one word. For example – input: “je suis étudiant” and expected output: “i am a student”. What this really means, is that we want our model to successively output probability distributions where:\n  • Each probability distribution is represented by a vector of width vocab_size (6 in our toy example, but more realistically a number like 30,000 or 50,000)\n  • The first probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “i”\n  • The second probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “am”\n  • And so on, until the fifth output distribution indicates ‘`\u003cend of sentence\u003e`’ symbol, which also has a cell associated with it from the 10,000 element vocabulary.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/output_target_probability_distributions.png) \n  The targeted probability distributions we'll train our model against in the training example for one sample sentence.

They increasingly become platforms for the transformation of property use and the hybridisation of rental markets, depending on the opportunity for rent extraction. Platforms make it easier to detect, at what time and under what circumstances, it is possible to offer the property use that maximiszes its economic performance. These dwellings constitute a form of floating residential housing supply. One week, a property might serve as a tourist apartment, but then be used as a temporary home for a student visiting the city for two semesters, then for a digital nomad who stays for two months, for a business woman who comes to the city for a week or even for a local resident who cannot find an apartment and uses the property as their main residence for a period of time. This leads to a decrease in specialisation, as rental platforms adapt their functions and create new products. As a result, an infrastructure is created to facilitate the continual transformation of housing uses. Owners transfer their properties between markets, leading to market and platform hybridisation. The main effect is that they find it easier to extract housing from the residential market and put it to other uses to increase the rents they generate. This process amplifies the exchange value of housing and the owners' future profit expectations , enhancing the opportunities and means for the financialization of housing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwkkw57dd3ekxcfngfw3d8zc))\n- If properties can be more easily switched from one use and market to another, there are more opportunities for landlords to keep their properties removed from the residential market. This reduces the supply of rental housing, but also influences the power dynamic between landlords and tenants – empowering the former and weakening the latter.

After all, many of these biases come from us being stuck in our own mind. But now we have another (strange, artificial) mind we can turn to for help. AI can assist us as a thinking companion to improve our own decision-making, helping us reflect on our own choices (rather than simply relying on the AI to make choices for us).

For example, to consider opportunity costs, you could list other alternatives you would want to spend money on, put costs in terms of hours of work, or even imagine yourself when retired. Not only are these tedious to consider, but they can be tedious to calculate. Again, this is where AI comes in. You can ask the AI: **I am 25 and making $22 an hour. I want to buy a new gaming PC for $2,800. How could I think of the opportunity cost of making the purchase both in terms of my work now, and in terms of my eventual retirement. Make whatever assumptions you need.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx9fnvzgw41dnctfh16thba3))\n- Given that the process of considering opportunity cost is designed to rob the joy out of purchases, it is not surprising that asking an AI to consider these issues is not fun. [But research suggests that considering opportunity costs leads to better decisions](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/page1-econ/2019/10/01/money-and-missed-opportunities), and it is very hard to communicate these topics in other ways (trust me, I have been involved in multiple efforts to build games to teach financial literacy).

This allows\n  seamless insertion of API calls into any given text,\n  using special tokens to mark the start and end of\n  each such call.

We then use a self-supervised loss to\n  determine which of these API calls actually help\n  the model in predicting future tokens. Finally, we\n  ﬁnetune the LM itself on the API calls that it con-\n  siders useful. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs562vsakc7e6gm4tkvz0mh2))\n- As a next step, we execute\n  all API calls generated by M to obtain the corre-\n  sponding results. How this is done depends entirely\n  on the API itself – for example, it can involve call-\n  ing another neural network, executing a Python\n  script or using a retrieval system to perform search\n  over a large corpus ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5651fp2zbjy5s11ykxtfxy))\n- For each API, we write a\n  prompt P(x) that encourages the LM to anno-\n  tate an example x = x1, . . . , xn with API calls.

This is due to the fact that API\n  calls for each tool are generated independently; as a\n  consequence, there are no examples of chained tool\n  use in the ﬁnetuning dataset ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs567xjvjtxnzbkz1py92r28))\n- we found models\n  trained with Toolformer to often be sensitive to the\n  exact wording of their input when deciding whether\n  or not to call an API; this is perhaps unsurprising\n  given that LMs are known to be very sensitive to\n  the prompt they are provided with in both zero-\n  and few-shot settings ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs568afsvrq89wf0zcx1c268))\n---\nauthor: [[arxiv.org]]\ntitle: \"Toolformer: LMs can teach themselves to use tools\"\ntags: \n- articles\n- literature-note\n---\n# Toolformer: LMs can teach themselves to use tools\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[arxiv.org]]\n- Full Title: Toolformer: LMs can teach themselves to use tools\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04761v1.pdf\n\n## Highlights\n- Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs56zjwr4x67myv3mm7x66k9))\n- we show that\n  LMs can teach themselves to use external tools\n  via simple APIs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs55kwd9kr4vas1cdfwhs26p))\n- Toolformer, a model\n  trained to decide which APIs to call, when to\n  call them, what arguments to pass, and how to\n  best incorporate the results into future token\n  prediction.

They're considered \"universal\" because they promise to encode general properties of sentences due to being trained on very large datasets. In theory, they can then be applied to any downstream NLP task without requiring domain specific knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtc1xcthx1thb0xba3ryhh4b))\n- Queries such as `How can I change my password`, `how can I setup an account`, or `Where do I setup my email` may represent common issues customers encounter and enquire about. There is no need for someone to come up with a new response here, there is probably documentation and a clear series of steps to take to resolve these issues. Instead of your customer support agent spending time looking for a previous similar query, or creating a new response, you would like them to be able to quickly retrieve the responses that were already provided. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtc239fv82v52cyzwd771qsh))\n- Sentence embeddings are interesting since they offer a number of ways in which you could potential use them in your business. They are versatile in how they can be deployed. For example, you could build a neural network to identify question and answer pairing. This is similar to the Amazon example we [mentioned earlier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.09439.pdf) where questions and answers are encoded and the network learns, via a supervised approach, to match correct pairings. It can then automatically identify an answer for a new incoming query.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt6pet55142sfp7574t99jkq))\n## New highlights added February 27, 2023 at 4:04 PM\n- a vector database should have the following features: 1) scalability and tunability, 2) multi-tenancy and data isolation, 3) a complete suite of APIs, and 4) an intuitive user interface/administrative console. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt9nzq46kwpzy6ssp1zkef85))\n- projects such as FAISS, ScaNN, and HNSW are lightweight *ANN libraries* rather than managed solutions. The intention of these libraries is to aid in the construction of vector indices - data structures designed to significantly speed up nearest neighbor search for multi-dimensional vectors[[1]](https://zilliz.com/learn/what-is-vector-database#fn1). If your dataset is small and limited, these libraries can prove to be sufficient for unstructured data processing, even for systems running in production. However, as dataset sizes increase and more users are onboarded, the problem of scale becomes increasingly difficult to solve.

In this sense, ANN libraries are one of the many components that vector databases are built on top of, similar to how [Elasticsearch is built on top of Apache Lucene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt9p25b6qge2r06vgtr4zpa6))\n- An increasing number of traditional databases and search systems such as Clickhouse and Elasticsearch are including built-in vector search plugins. Elasticsearch 8.0, for example, includes vector insertion and ANN search functionality that can be called via restful API endpoints. The problem with vector search plugins should be clear as night and day - **these solutions do not take a full-stack approach to embedding management and vector search.** Instead, these plugins are meant to be enhancements on top of existing architectures, thereby making them limited and unoptimized. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt9p3gdhdqzkx40r0wenvehx))\n- While both Elasticsearch and Milvus have methods for creating indexes, inserting embedding vectors, and performing nearest neighbor search, it’s clear from these examples that Milvus has a more intuitive vector search API (better user-facing API) and broader vector index + distance metric support (better tunability). Milvus also plans to support more vector indices and allow for querying via SQL-like statements in the future, further improving both tunability and usability.

I thought that if a process’ results were poor, it was because the process needed more nuance and sophistication. What I’ve learned since, mostly through designing thoughtful processes that nonetheless failed, is that good process is a deliberate tradeoff between quality and overhead. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx741h56kz41gh50gx5wqh37))\n- To figure out the appropriate degree of process sophistication for your team, you have to start by figuring out who’s going to run the processes, and reason backwards from that answer to the degree of process sophistication your organization is capable of sustaining. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx742kvtzz7dgp403ex44sh4))\n- Brand new companies all use what I call the **Early Startup** pattern: either a founder or the functional executive does something for their function, or it doesn’t happen. My first year as Calm’s CTO, there were no shared People processes, and I ran Engineering’s performance review process out of a spreadsheet. It needed to get done, and I was in the position to do it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx7489kanfn70qzhsasp2j9m))\n- Finally, there is the **Business Unit Local** pattern, where engineering reports into each business unit’s leadership, and there is no longer any one leader who is responsible for the entirety of engineering ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx74ddag3na85gwasy9z2b2k))\n- Any process that you want to run needs to be run by the founders, or managers hired by those founders.\n  Companies usually exit this pattern because there is impactful process they want to run, often initially this is performance management, but they feel they’re too busy to run it with the current team. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx74eqag0vxkj9hjfe72y5x7))\n- *Pros*: low cost, low overhead, few downsides at small scale beacuse most process is focused on supporting large teams\n  *Cons*: often valuable stuff doesn’t happen because everyone is too busy, sometimes quality of process is very low due to limited time or experience running that process ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx74f3pcjhmr3ftmvsyhq32h))\n- **Baseline**: Engineering-scoped processes are run by engineers or engineering managers, and company-scoped processes are run by a centralized function, usually in People or Human Resources. Most companies stay in the baseline pattern for an extended period of time, with perhaps one small exception for a dedicated recruiter for engineering hires. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx74fyk1fknm79rddbg4g00p))\n- some modest specialization to allow Engineering to focus on engineering rather than foundational company process, complexity of HR tasks tend to outstrip engineering manager depth by this phase (e.g. managing visas), unified systems allow executive team to inspect across functions rather than just in their own function ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx74gyq2nc511eetsd7am4pk))\n- **Specialized Engineering Roles**: increase efficiency in Engineering-scoped processes by hiring dedicated, specialized roles to fulfill that work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx74p87919bz515hmev63k63))\n- It’s [a lot of work to effectively support specialized roles](https://lethain.com/specialized-roles/) like engineering operations or technical program management. Specialized roles often freeze a company in a given way of working, whereas engineers is incentivized to eliminate a process, the specialist is incentivized to improve it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx74jf81wnjpy4p4epjaj1mg))\n- **Business Unit Local**: each business unit in a company has its own, separate engineering function. This split typically occurs when an organization becomes large enough to have multiple meaningful business units, and there’s a perception that standardization across engineering in those business units is unnecessary or unnecessarily expensive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx74mtfkzkpgmydsn2ejkjae))\n- All of these patterns have flaws, but are worth considering. That said, if you asked me to pick one without any additional context, I would always recommend the baseline pattern. It’s generally good enough, and the easiest to manage ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx74nrfgta5zx0qmrpkg9fqt))\n- While there are operational challenges to moving across patterns, most of those challenges are only obvious in hindsight. Instead, the biggest impediment for moving from *Early Startup* to *Baseline* or from *Baseline* to *Specialized Engineering Roles* will be the budget implications. Even if you can show that three Technical Program Managers would significantly improve Engineering impact–which likely is true but you likely can’t prove with a spreadsheet–most budgeting processes are anchored on relative dollars rather than absolute impact. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx74sb1b182a7zr596badkmv))\n- Most companies that successfully shift up the patterns’ cost curve do so when they are rapidly growing. Such companies are comfortable with rapidly growing headcount costs, and are generally tolerant of adding roles to support that growth. In all other circumstances, companies generally aren’t tolerant of adding new roles and structures, even if they would likely increase efficiency.

The primary reason for this is the inherent over-reliance in the relationship between a manager and a single report ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwswz9a39qzgcphyhgqxjz4c))\n- The new manager is over-reliant on making sure their single report likes them and is doing well. If ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwswzemabpf72med2axwkt48))\n- The manager’s over-reliance on the direct report’s success and happiness leads to risk-averse behavior, like not giving critical feedback or overcompensating. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwswzke931yjr11k6sw3aq7r))\n- The single report is isolated. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwswzsjgq46z6h40kkqp94aw))\n- No one in this relationship has the ability to get context. With more reports, a manager gets clearer signals when they’re wrong. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwsx01q9kftd6ykyxtmpcnx2))\n- To further the problematic conditions, the single report will often be a very junior hire. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwsx0j4z6zeh1x1qw0xa84gd))\n- It’s not uncommon for these relationships to turn sour. The manager makes mistakes as they always do. The report makes mistakes as they always do. Fingers are pointed. Times are dire. If you ever hear someone call their manager a “first-time manager”, you know the relationship has reached a special level of hell. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwsx0y6b9eq0k4gmctt4x9dy))\n- Avoid having first time managers have a team of 1 individual contributor for a prolonged amount of time. That team size is an [anti-pattern](https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/06/21/goldilocks-management-structure.html) for more reasons than just this one.

Sutton]]\n- Full Title: You Need Two Leadership Gears\n- Category: #articles\n- Document Note: The most effective leaders are able to shift between two different leadership styles to meet the demands of the moment. They use their formal authority and respect to guide their team when to switch between these two power modes. The research shows that teams who switch back and forth between hierarchical and participatory models outperform those who remain in one mode. Leaders must be mindful of their words, body language and participation in meetings to effectively shift between the two styles. They must also set expectations for their team before meetings and use tools such as assigning a devil's advocate to encourage open debate. Knowing when to get in the way and when to get out of the way is key to successful leadership.\n- URL: https://hbr.org/2023/03/you-need-two-leadership-gears\n\n## Highlights\n- Our research shows that when leaders and teams get stuck in either “exercise authority” mode (in which the leader holds tightly on to power) or “flat” mode (in which the leader levels the hierarchy and shares power), they run into trouble. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt2t49q525kk2svcfm9bw88c))\n- Leaders who are adept at shifting power modes let everyone know when it’s time for divergent thinking (during idea generation, for instance) and when it’s time for convergent thinking (to, say, map out next steps). They send clear signals about when their teams should offer suggestions, raise concerns about problems and risks, and argue. They also make it psychologically safe for people to speak up—ensuring they feel they’ll be heard, respected, and valued. And when it’s time to end the discussion, make a decision, and act, skilled leaders signal that they’re taking charge again. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt2t6tkrqjmndve511dhy9jw))\n- Members of the best teams don’t treat rules and roles like a musical composition that’s played exactly as written. Instead, like jazz musicians, they improvise, trying new things and constantly making adjustments in response to one another’s moves, while still being guided—and often constrained—by the original theme. Jazz bands routinely rotate leadership, giving each player a chance to have a solo or develop a musical idea while others play a supporting role. This ability to support another musician is known as *comping*—listening and responding without overshadowing—and it’s one reason jazz players are so respected by other musicians. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt2thj7p6nnkeqp1axxj1c8e))\n- Look at how much airtime you get. We’ve found that leaders often talk too much in meetings where everyone is supposed to contribute.\n  Like good jazz players, successful leaders excel at both exerting their power and relinquishing it at the appropriate times. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt2v4kcy4dzpm7hqa629kbk8))\n- Leaders who know when and how to cede power earn respect and commitment. The best people want to work for them, and the team member with the most pertinent expertise sways decisions. For all those reasons, their teams perform better. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt2v58wyc9d4fy5w9eysjwzm))\n- It’s also good to actively seek feedback from people close to you who see you in action and are willing to be candid with you. Ask them to let you know whether you’re too dominating in conversations that would benefit from a diversity of perspectives and whether your presence stifles discussion because people don’t feel comfortable speaking their minds. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt2v7m9z8wfqq3e3133735mf))\n- A good way to do that is to specify “debate” under an agenda item, with the amount of time that will be devoted to the discussion, followed by “commit and act,” with the name of the decision-maker. If a meeting is being held to announce a decision and answer questions about what it means for the team, state that in the invitation, and make it clear the meeting is not a brainstorming session or an occasion for input. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt2vb0y22kc411phpgqxjv0g))\n- When coaching leaders we use the hippopotamus as a metaphor: Leaders have to know when to rise out of the water and exercise their power and when to cede it to others and sink down, leaving just their eyes above the surface to discreetly watch their teams. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt2vgsydag60q9k2krmn2sjs))\n- Tell people that right now it’s time to change modes, using simple, clear language and maybe even raising your voice a bit. The CEO of a global technology company we work with does this well. He routinely announces, “Let’s create a moment for brainstorming” or “We’ve heard many perspectives; let’s now turn to making a decision.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt2vjt6ks83v78gerk7yta17))\n- If you’re the most powerful person in the room, no matter what you do or say, your mere presence can be intimidating. Your authority alone can squelch comment and debate and create awkward silences after someone offers an idea and everyone waits for you to express an opinion ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt2vphw59kn236dmmgeqx9q7))\n- Kennedy gathered some 20 experts with diverse viewpoints and knowledge. To encourage them to express their opinions and avoid groupthink, he divided them into smaller teams and asked each team to develop possible solutions. Then, following the advice of his brother Robert Kennedy, who “felt there was less true give-and-take with the president in the room,” JFK deliberately chose not to attend some of the team meetings.

It’s a fever swamp of urges, desires, and judgments. It’s fixated on the past and the future, to the detriment of the here and now. ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=68))\n- Our entire lives, he argued, are governed by a voice in our heads. This voice is engaged in a ceaseless stream of thinking—most of it negative, repetitive, and self-referential. It squawks away at us from the minute we open our eyes in the morning until the minute we fall asleep at night, if it allows us to sleep at all. Talk, talk, talk: the voice is constantly judging and labeling everything in its field of vision. Its targets aren’t just external; it often viciously taunts us, too. ([Location 979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=979))\n- The ego is never satisfied. No matter how much stuff we buy, no matter how many arguments we win or delicious meals we consume, the ego never feels complete. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=998))\n- The ego is constantly comparing itself to others. It has us measuring our self-worth against the looks, wealth, and social status of everyone else. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1000))\n- The ego thrives on drama. It keeps our old resentments and grievances alive through compulsive thought. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1002))\n- Perhaps the most powerful Tollean insight into the ego was that it is obsessed with the past and the future, at the expense of the present. We “live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation,” ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1003))\n- “When you have one foot in the future and the other in the past, you piss on the present.” ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1009))\n- in the deadline-dominated world of news, I was always hurtling headlong through the day, checking things off my to-do list, constantly picturing completion instead of calmly and carefully enjoying the process. The unspoken assumption behind most of my forward momentum was that whatever was coming next would definitely be better. Only when I reached that ineffable … whatever … would I be totally satisfied. ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1010))\n- “Make the present moment your friend rather than your enemy.

I thought I was being mindful of my distress when I was left out of the big stories, but really I was just building a wall to keep out the things that made me angry or fearful. The final pitfall to which I’d succumbed was nihilism: an occasional sense of, “Whatever, man, everything’s impermanent.” ([Location 3266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=3266))\n- “Praise Allah, but also tie your camel to the post.” In other words, it’s good to take a transcendent view of the world, but don’t be a chump.

I had come up through a system that venerated bootstrapping and a fierce refusal to fail. Doing this without attachment didn’t seem to fit the paradigm.

I said, “When we last spoke, you said it’s okay to be ambitious, but don’t be attached to the results. I cut you off, as I usually do—but what does that mean?” “It’s like, you write a book, you want it to be well received, you want it to be at the top of the bestsellers list, but you have limited control over what happens. You can hire a publicist, you can do every interview, you can be prepared, but you have very little control over the marketplace. So you put it out there without attachment, so it has its own life.

If you don’t waste your energy on variables you cannot influence, you can focus much more effectively on those you can. When you are wisely ambitious, you do everything you can to succeed, but you are not attached to the outcome—so that if you fail, you will be maximally resilient, able to get up, dust yourself off, and get back in the fray.

The practice has countless benefits—from better health to increased focus to a deeper sense of calm—but the biggie is the ability to respond instead of react to your impulses and urges. We live our life propelled by desire and aversion. In meditation, instead of succumbing to these deeply rooted habits of mind, you are simply watching what comes up in your head nonjudgmentally.

This voice is engaged in a ceaseless stream of thinking—most of it negative, repetitive, and self-referential. It squawks away at us from the minute we open our eyes in the morning until the minute we fall asleep at night, if it allows us to sleep at all. Talk, talk, talk: the voice is constantly judging and labeling everything in its field of vision. Its targets aren’t just external; it often viciously taunts us, too.

This voice is engaged in a ceaseless stream of thinking—most of it negative, repetitive, and self-referential. It squawks away at us from the minute we open our eyes in the morning until the minute we fall asleep at night, if it allows us to sleep at all. Talk, talk, talk: the voice is constantly judging and labeling everything in its field of vision. Its targets aren’t just external; it often viciously taunts us, too.

The unspoken assumption behind most of my forward momentum was that whatever was coming next would definitely be better. Only when I reached that ineffable … whatever … would I be totally satisfied.

([Location 1503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1503))\n- In a nutshell, mindfulness is the ability to recognize what is happening in your mind right now—anger, jealousy, sadness, the pain of a stubbed toe, whatever—without getting carried away by it. ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1719))\n- According to the Buddha, we have three habitual responses to everything we experience. We want it, reject it, or we zone out. Cookies: I want. Mosquitoes: I reject. The safety instructions the flight attendants read aloud on an airplane: I zone out. Mindfulness is a fourth option, a way to view the contents of our mind with nonjudgmental remove. I found this theory elegant, but utterly unfeasible.

(Not here in the West, at least.) We can do more than just think; we also have the power simply to be aware of things—without judgment, without the ego. This is not to denigrate thinking, just to say that thinking without awareness can be a harsh master.

His delivery was off-the-cuff and shtick-free. In stark contrast to Brach, he argued that we needed to actively get in touch with our ugly side. “Mindfulness gives us a way to examine our self-hatred without trying to make it go away, without trying to love it particularly.” Just being mindful of it, he said, could be “tremendously liberating.” ([Location 1851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1851))\n- Seeing a problem clearly does not prevent you from taking action, he explained. Acceptance is not passivity. Sometimes we are justifiably displeased. What mindfulness does is create some space in your head so you can, as the Buddhists say, “respond” rather than simply “react.” In the Buddhist view, you can’t control what comes up in your head; it all arises out of a mysterious void. We spend a lot of time judging ourselves harshly for feelings that we had no role in summoning. The only thing you can control is how you handle it.

Do we bite? Or do we not bite, and just swim freely in the ocean?” ([Location 2173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=2173))\n- After an initial period of “how dare he” indignation over Jim Murphy telling me I was never going to be a big-time anchorman, I decided to approach the problem in a Buddhist style: to lean into it, to take his views seriously, no matter how inconvenient they may have been—to respond, rather than react.

When you lurch from one thing to the next, constantly scheming, or reacting to incoming fire, the mind gets exhausted. You get sloppy and make bad decisions. I could see how the counterintuitive act of stopping, even for a few seconds, could be a source of strength, not weakness. This was a practical complement to Joseph’s “is this useful?” mantra.

It squawks away at us from the minute we open our eyes in the morning until the minute we fall asleep at night, if it allows us to sleep at all. Talk, talk, talk: the voice is constantly judging and labeling everything in its field of vision. Its targets aren’t just external; it often viciously taunts us, too. ([Location 979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=979))\n- The ego is never satisfied. No matter how much stuff we buy, no matter how many arguments we win or delicious meals we consume, the ego never feels complete. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=998))\n- The ego is constantly comparing itself to others. It has us measuring our self-worth against the looks, wealth, and social status of everyone else. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1000))\n- The ego thrives on drama. It keeps our old resentments and grievances alive through compulsive thought. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1002))\n- Perhaps the most powerful Tollean insight into the ego was that it is obsessed with the past and the future, at the expense of the present. We “live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation,” ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1003))\n- “When you have one foot in the future and the other in the past, you piss on the present.” ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1009))\n- in the deadline-dominated world of news, I was always hurtling headlong through the day, checking things off my to-do list, constantly picturing completion instead of calmly and carefully enjoying the process. The unspoken assumption behind most of my forward momentum was that whatever was coming next would definitely be better. Only when I reached that ineffable … whatever … would I be totally satisfied.

Because many people live habitually as if the present moment were an obstacle that they need to overcome in order to get to the next moment. And imagine living your whole life like that, where always this moment is never quite right, not good enough because you need to get to the next one. That is continuous stress.” ([Location 1171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1171))\n- The route to true happiness, he argued, was to achieve a visceral understanding of impermanence, which would take you off the emotional roller coaster and allow you to see your dramas and desires through a wider lens.

([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1719))\n- According to the Buddha, we have three habitual responses to everything we experience. We want it, reject it, or we zone out. Cookies: I want. Mosquitoes: I reject. The safety instructions the flight attendants read aloud on an airplane: I zone out. Mindfulness is a fourth option, a way to view the contents of our mind with nonjudgmental remove. I found this theory elegant, but utterly unfeasible. ([Location 1721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1721))\n- Our minds have this other capability—a bonus level, to put it in gamerspeak—that no one ever tells us about in school. (Not here in the West, at least.) We can do more than just think; we also have the power simply to be aware of things—without judgment, without the ego. This is not to denigrate thinking, just to say that thinking without awareness can be a harsh master.

His delivery was off-the-cuff and shtick-free. In stark contrast to Brach, he argued that we needed to actively get in touch with our ugly side. “Mindfulness gives us a way to examine our self-hatred without trying to make it go away, without trying to love it particularly.” Just being mindful of it, he said, could be “tremendously liberating.” ([Location 1851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1851))\n- Seeing a problem clearly does not prevent you from taking action, he explained. Acceptance is not passivity. Sometimes we are justifiably displeased. What mindfulness does is create some space in your head so you can, as the Buddhists say, “respond” rather than simply “react.” In the Buddhist view, you can’t control what comes up in your head; it all arises out of a mysterious void. We spend a lot of time judging ourselves harshly for feelings that we had no role in summoning. The only thing you can control is how you handle it.

Do we bite? Or do we not bite, and just swim freely in the ocean?” ([Location 2173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=2173))\n- After an initial period of “how dare he” indignation over Jim Murphy telling me I was never going to be a big-time anchorman, I decided to approach the problem in a Buddhist style: to lean into it, to take his views seriously, no matter how inconvenient they may have been—to respond, rather than react.

When you lurch from one thing to the next, constantly scheming, or reacting to incoming fire, the mind gets exhausted. You get sloppy and make bad decisions. I could see how the counterintuitive act of stopping, even for a few seconds, could be a source of strength, not weakness. This was a practical complement to Joseph’s “is this useful?” mantra.

I thought I was being mindful of my distress when I was left out of the big stories, but really I was just building a wall to keep out the things that made me angry or fearful. The final pitfall to which I’d succumbed was nihilism: an occasional sense of, “Whatever, man, everything’s impermanent.” ([Location 3266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=3266))\n- “Praise Allah, but also tie your camel to the post.” In other words, it’s good to take a transcendent view of the world, but don’t be a chump.

I had come up through a system that venerated bootstrapping and a fierce refusal to fail. Doing this without attachment didn’t seem to fit the paradigm.

I said, “When we last spoke, you said it’s okay to be ambitious, but don’t be attached to the results. I cut you off, as I usually do—but what does that mean?” “It’s like, you write a book, you want it to be well received, you want it to be at the top of the bestsellers list, but you have limited control over what happens. You can hire a publicist, you can do every interview, you can be prepared, but you have very little control over the marketplace. So you put it out there without attachment, so it has its own life. Everything is like that.” ([Location 3354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=3354))\n- Striving is fine, as long as it’s tempered by the realization that, in an entropic universe, the final outcome is out of your control. If you don’t waste your energy on variables you cannot influence, you can focus much more effectively on those you can. When you are wisely ambitious, you do everything you can to succeed, but you are not attached to the outcome—so that if you fail, you will be maximally resilient, able to get up, dust yourself off, and get back in the fray. That, to use a loaded term, is enlightened self-interest.

The practice has countless benefits—from better health to increased focus to a deeper sense of calm—but the biggie is the ability to respond instead of react to your impulses and urges.

Rothbard]]\n- Full Title: Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- The Whig theory, subscribed to by almost all historians of science, including economics, is that scientific thought progresses patiently, one year after another developing, sifting, and testing theories, so that science marches onward and upward, each year, decade or generation learning more and possessing ever more correct scientific theories. ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=100))\n- The concrete realization that important economic knowledge had been lost over time came to me from absorbing the great revision of the scholastics that developed in the 1950s and 1960s. The pioneering revision came dramatically in Schumpeter's great History of Economic Analysis, and was developed in the works of Raymond de Roover, Marjorie Grice-Hutchinson and John T. Noonan.

([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=327))\n- The honour of being the first Greek economic thinker goes to the poet Hesiod, a Boeotian who lived in the very early ancient Greece of the middle of the eighth century BC. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=367))\n- Hesiod adopts the common religious or tribal myth of the ‘Golden Age’, of man's alleged initial state on earth as an Eden, a Paradise of limitless abundance. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=374))\n- Democritus contributed two important strands of thought to the development of economics. First, he was the founder of subjective value theory. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=398))\n- Moral values, ethics, were absolute, Democritus taught, but economic values were necessarily subjective. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=399))\n- Democritus, having seen the contrast between the private property economy of Athens and the oligarchic collectivism of Sparta, concluded that private property is a superior form of economic organization. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=409))\n- Plato contributed to genuine economic science by being the first to expound and analyse the importance of the division of labour in society. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=434))\n- The three main schools of political thought: the Legalists, the Taoists, and the Confucians, were established from the sixth to the fourth centuries BC. Roughly, the Legalists, the latest of the three broad schools, simply believed in maximal power to the state, and advised rulers how to increase that power. The Taoists were the world's first libertarians, who believed in virtually no interference by the state in economy or society, and the Confucians were middle-of-the-roaders on this critical issue. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=677))\n- By far the most interesting of the Chinese political philosophers were the Taoists, founded by the immensely important but shadowy figure of Lao Tzu. ([Location 684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=684))\n- Two centuries later, Lao Tzu's great follower Chuang Tzu (369–c.286 BC) built on the master's ideas of laissez-faire to push them to their logical conclusion: individualist anarchism. The influential Chuang Tzu, a great stylist who wrote in allegorical parables, was therefore the first anarchist in the history of human thought. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=701))\n- Taoist thought flourished for several centuries, culminating in the most determinedly anarchistic thinker, Pao Ching-yen, who lived in the early fourth century AD, and about whose life nothing is known. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=727))\n- In a happy and stateless world, declared Pao, the people would naturally turn to thoughts of good order and not be interested in plundering their neighbours. But rulers oppress and loot the people and ‘make them toil without rest and wrest away things from them endlessly.’ In that way, theft and banditry are stimulated among the unhappy people, and arms and armour, intended to pacify the public, are stolen by bandits to intensify their plunder. ‘All these things are brought about because there are rulers.’ The common idea, concluded Pao, that strong government is needed to combat disorders among the people, commits the serious error of confusing cause and effect. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=746))\n- Augustine's economic views were scattered throughout The City of God and his other highly influential writings. But he definitely, and presumably independently of Aristotle, arrived at the view that people's payments for goods, the valuation they placed on them, was determined by their own needs rather than by any more objective criterion or by their rank in the order of nature. This was at least the basis of the later Austrian theory of subjective value. He also pointed out that it was the common desire of all men to buy cheap and to sell dear. ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=850))\n- But St Augustine's stress was on the individual's personality unfolding itself and therefore progressing over time. Hence Augustine's profound emphasis on the individual at least set the stage indirectly for an attitude favourable to innovation, economic growth and development. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=865))\n- If St Augustine looked benignly on the role of the merchant, he was also favourable, though not as warmly, towards the social role of rulers of state. On the one hand, Augustine took up and expanded Cicero's parable demonstrating that Alexander the Great was simply a pirate writ large, and that the state is nothing but a large-scale and settled robber band. ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=869))\n- In capitulary after capitulary, Charlemagne and his successors laid down detailed regulations for every aspect of economic, political and religious life throughout the empire. Many of these regulations became incorporated into the canon law of later centuries, thereby remaining influential well after the crumbling of the Carolingian Empire itself. ([Location 894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=894))\n- Charlemagne revived, greatly broadened and imposed the old doctrine of turpe lucrum. But now the prohibition was extended from the clergy to everyone, and the definition broadened from fraud to all greed and avarice, and included any disobedience of Charlemagne's extensive price regulations. Any market deviations from these fixed prices were accused of being profiteering by either buyers or sellers and hence turpe lucrum. As a corollary, all speculative buying and selling in foodstuffs was prohibited. ([Location 898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=898))\n- Since the English common law was motivated, not by a misguided attempt to aid the poor but in order to confer monopoly privileges on local owners of market sites, it is highly probable that Charlemagne, too, was trying to cartelize markets and confer privileges on market owners.

From the time of Huguccio, private property was to be considered a sacrosanct right derived from the natural law. The property of individuals and communities was, at least in principle, supposed to be free from arbitrary invasion on the part of the state. As ‘moderator and arbiter’ of his own goods, an individual owner could use and dispose of them as he saw fit, provided that he did not violate general legal rules.

Influenced by Carolingian practice, and by hints from the sixth century Rule of St Benedict, the late twelfth century canonist and student of Gratian, Simon of Bosignano, first described the true value of goods as the price for which they commonly sold.

This is lucrum cessans (profit ceasing), a legitimate interest charge by the creditor to compensate him for profit foregone in investing the money himself. ([Location 1110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=1110))\n- In short, lucrum cessans anticipated the Austrian concept of opportunity cost, of income foregone, and applied it to the charging of interest. Unfortunately, however, Cardinal Hostiensis's use of lucrum cessans was limited to non-habitual lenders who lend money out of charity to a debtor. Thus lenders could not be in the business of charging money on a loan, even on the ground of lucrum cessans.

In contrast to Aristotle, Aquinas was not frightened at the idea of the value of money fluctuating on the market. On the contrary, Aquinas recognized that the purchasing power of money was bound to fluctuate, and was content if it fluctuated, as it usually did, more stably than did particular prices.

First, he was the founder of subjective value theory. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=398))\n- Moral values, ethics, were absolute, Democritus taught, but economic values were necessarily subjective. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=399))\n- Democritus, having seen the contrast between the private property economy of Athens and the oligarchic collectivism of Sparta, concluded that private property is a superior form of economic organization. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=409))\n- Plato contributed to genuine economic science by being the first to expound and analyse the importance of the division of labour in society. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=434))\n- The three main schools of political thought: the Legalists, the Taoists, and the Confucians, were established from the sixth to the fourth centuries BC. Roughly, the Legalists, the latest of the three broad schools, simply believed in maximal power to the state, and advised rulers how to increase that power. The Taoists were the world's first libertarians, who believed in virtually no interference by the state in economy or society, and the Confucians were middle-of-the-roaders on this critical issue. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=677))\n- Two centuries later, Lao Tzu's great follower Chuang Tzu (369–c.286 BC) built on the master's ideas of laissez-faire to push them to their logical conclusion: individualist anarchism. The influential Chuang Tzu, a great stylist who wrote in allegorical parables, was therefore the first anarchist in the history of human thought. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=701))\n- Taoist thought flourished for several centuries, culminating in the most determinedly anarchistic thinker, Pao Ching-yen, who lived in the early fourth century AD, and about whose life nothing is known. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=727))\n- In a happy and stateless world, declared Pao, the people would naturally turn to thoughts of good order and not be interested in plundering their neighbours. But rulers oppress and loot the people and ‘make them toil without rest and wrest away things from them endlessly.’ In that way, theft and banditry are stimulated among the unhappy people, and arms and armour, intended to pacify the public, are stolen by bandits to intensify their plunder. ‘All these things are brought about because there are rulers.’ The common idea, concluded Pao, that strong government is needed to combat disorders among the people, commits the serious error of confusing cause and effect. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=746))\n- Augustine's economic views were scattered throughout The City of God and his other highly influential writings. But he definitely, and presumably independently of Aristotle, arrived at the view that people's payments for goods, the valuation they placed on them, was determined by their own needs rather than by any more objective criterion or by their rank in the order of nature. This was at least the basis of the later Austrian theory of subjective value. He also pointed out that it was the common desire of all men to buy cheap and to sell dear. ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=850))\n- But St Augustine's stress was on the individual's personality unfolding itself and therefore progressing over time. Hence Augustine's profound emphasis on the individual at least set the stage indirectly for an attitude favourable to innovation, economic growth and development. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=865))\n- If St Augustine looked benignly on the role of the merchant, he was also favourable, though not as warmly, towards the social role of rulers of state. On the one hand, Augustine took up and expanded Cicero's parable demonstrating that Alexander the Great was simply a pirate writ large, and that the state is nothing but a large-scale and settled robber band. ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=869))\n- In capitulary after capitulary, Charlemagne and his successors laid down detailed regulations for every aspect of economic, political and religious life throughout the empire. Many of these regulations became incorporated into the canon law of later centuries, thereby remaining influential well after the crumbling of the Carolingian Empire itself. ([Location 894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=894))\n- Charlemagne revived, greatly broadened and imposed the old doctrine of turpe lucrum. But now the prohibition was extended from the clergy to everyone, and the definition broadened from fraud to all greed and avarice, and included any disobedience of Charlemagne's extensive price regulations. Any market deviations from these fixed prices were accused of being profiteering by either buyers or sellers and hence turpe lucrum. As a corollary, all speculative buying and selling in foodstuffs was prohibited. ([Location 898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=898))\n- Since the English common law was motivated, not by a misguided attempt to aid the poor but in order to confer monopoly privileges on local owners of market sites, it is highly probable that Charlemagne, too, was trying to cartelize markets and confer privileges on market owners. ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=903))\n- Huguccio began a radical reconstruction of Patristic teachings about private property. From the time of Huguccio, private property was to be considered a sacrosanct right derived from the natural law. The property of individuals and communities was, at least in principle, supposed to be free from arbitrary invasion on the part of the state. As ‘moderator and arbiter’ of his own goods, an individual owner could use and dispose of them as he saw fit, provided that he did not violate general legal rules. A ruler could only expropriate the property of an innocent subject if ‘public necessity’ required it.

The pioneering revision came dramatically in Schumpeter's great History of Economic Analysis, and was developed in the works of Raymond de Roover, Marjorie Grice-Hutchinson and John T. Noonan. ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=131))\n- I came to the conclusion that the Calvinist emphasis could account, for example, for Smith's otherwise puzzling championing of usury laws, as well as his shift in emphasis from the capricious, luxury-loving consumer as the determinant of value, to ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=172))\n- In the year 404 BC, the despotic state of Sparta conquered Athens and established a reign of terror known as the Rule of the Thirty Tyrants. ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=327))\n- The honour of being the first Greek economic thinker goes to the poet Hesiod, a Boeotian who lived in the very early ancient Greece of the middle of the eighth century BC. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=367))\n- Hesiod adopts the common religious or tribal myth of the ‘Golden Age’, of man's alleged initial state on earth as an Eden, a Paradise of limitless abundance. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=374))\n- Democritus contributed two important strands of thought to the development of economics. First, he was the founder of subjective value theory. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=398))\n- Moral values, ethics, were absolute, Democritus taught, but economic values were necessarily subjective. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=399))\n- Democritus, having seen the contrast between the private property economy of Athens and the oligarchic collectivism of Sparta, concluded that private property is a superior form of economic organization. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=409))\n- Plato contributed to genuine economic science by being the first to expound and analyse the importance of the division of labour in society. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=434))\n- The three main schools of political thought: the Legalists, the Taoists, and the Confucians, were established from the sixth to the fourth centuries BC. Roughly, the Legalists, the latest of the three broad schools, simply believed in maximal power to the state, and advised rulers how to increase that power. The Taoists were the world's first libertarians, who believed in virtually no interference by the state in economy or society, and the Confucians were middle-of-the-roaders on this critical issue. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=677))\n- Two centuries later, Lao Tzu's great follower Chuang Tzu (369–c.286 BC) built on the master's ideas of laissez-faire to push them to their logical conclusion: individualist anarchism. The influential Chuang Tzu, a great stylist who wrote in allegorical parables, was therefore the first anarchist in the history of human thought. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=701))\n- Taoist thought flourished for several centuries, culminating in the most determinedly anarchistic thinker, Pao Ching-yen, who lived in the early fourth century AD, and about whose life nothing is known. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=727))\n- In a happy and stateless world, declared Pao, the people would naturally turn to thoughts of good order and not be interested in plundering their neighbours. But rulers oppress and loot the people and ‘make them toil without rest and wrest away things from them endlessly.’ In that way, theft and banditry are stimulated among the unhappy people, and arms and armour, intended to pacify the public, are stolen by bandits to intensify their plunder. ‘All these things are brought about because there are rulers.’ The common idea, concluded Pao, that strong government is needed to combat disorders among the people, commits the serious error of confusing cause and effect. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=746))\n- Augustine's economic views were scattered throughout The City of God and his other highly influential writings. But he definitely, and presumably independently of Aristotle, arrived at the view that people's payments for goods, the valuation they placed on them, was determined by their own needs rather than by any more objective criterion or by their rank in the order of nature. This was at least the basis of the later Austrian theory of subjective value. He also pointed out that it was the common desire of all men to buy cheap and to sell dear. ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=850))\n- But St Augustine's stress was on the individual's personality unfolding itself and therefore progressing over time. Hence Augustine's profound emphasis on the individual at least set the stage indirectly for an attitude favourable to innovation, economic growth and development. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=865))\n- If St Augustine looked benignly on the role of the merchant, he was also favourable, though not as warmly, towards the social role of rulers of state. On the one hand, Augustine took up and expanded Cicero's parable demonstrating that Alexander the Great was simply a pirate writ large, and that the state is nothing but a large-scale and settled robber band. ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=869))\n- In capitulary after capitulary, Charlemagne and his successors laid down detailed regulations for every aspect of economic, political and religious life throughout the empire. Many of these regulations became incorporated into the canon law of later centuries, thereby remaining influential well after the crumbling of the Carolingian Empire itself. ([Location 894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=894))\n- Charlemagne revived, greatly broadened and imposed the old doctrine of turpe lucrum. But now the prohibition was extended from the clergy to everyone, and the definition broadened from fraud to all greed and avarice, and included any disobedience of Charlemagne's extensive price regulations. Any market deviations from these fixed prices were accused of being profiteering by either buyers or sellers and hence turpe lucrum. As a corollary, all speculative buying and selling in foodstuffs was prohibited. ([Location 898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=898))\n- Since the English common law was motivated, not by a misguided attempt to aid the poor but in order to confer monopoly privileges on local owners of market sites, it is highly probable that Charlemagne, too, was trying to cartelize markets and confer privileges on market owners. ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=903))\n- Huguccio began a radical reconstruction of Patristic teachings about private property. From the time of Huguccio, private property was to be considered a sacrosanct right derived from the natural law. The property of individuals and communities was, at least in principle, supposed to be free from arbitrary invasion on the part of the state. As ‘moderator and arbiter’ of his own goods, an individual owner could use and dispose of them as he saw fit, provided that he did not violate general legal rules. A ruler could only expropriate the property of an innocent subject if ‘public necessity’ required it. ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=937))\n- The canon lawyers adopted the same criterion for the just price. Influenced by Carolingian practice, and by hints from the sixth century Rule of St Benedict, the late twelfth century canonist and student of Gratian, Simon of Bosignano, first described the true value of goods as the price for which they commonly sold. ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=1009))\n- Hostiensis provided the first path-breaking argument for charging a rate of interest on a loan from the very beginning, a charge that does not involve delay or guarantees. This is lucrum cessans (profit ceasing), a legitimate interest charge by the creditor to compensate him for profit foregone in investing the money himself. ([Location 1110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=1110))\n- In short, lucrum cessans anticipated the Austrian concept of opportunity cost, of income foregone, and applied it to the charging of interest. Unfortunately, however, Cardinal Hostiensis's use of lucrum cessans was limited to non-habitual lenders who lend money out of charity to a debtor. Thus lenders could not be in the business of charging money on a loan, even on the ground of lucrum cessans. ([Location 1112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=1112))\n- The German Dominican St Albert the Great performed the enormous service to philosophy of bringing Aristotle and Aristotelianism back to Western thought. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=1200))\n- St Thomas was clearly an Aristotelian in adopting the latter's trenchant view that the determinant of exchange value was the need, or utility, of consumers, as expressed in their demand for products. And so, this proto-Austrian aspect of value based on demand and utility was reinstated in economic thought. ([Location 1230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=1230))\n- It should come as no surprise that Aquinas, in contrast to Aristotle, was highly favourable towards the activities of the merchant. Mercantile profit, he declared, was a stipend for the merchant's labour, and a reward for shouldering the risks of transportation. ([Location 1266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0041KL4UU\u0026location=1266))\n- Building on Aristotle's theory of money, Aquinas pointed out its indispensability as a medium of exchange, a ‘measure’ of expression of values, and a unit of account. In contrast to Aristotle, Aquinas was not frightened at the idea of the value of money fluctuating on the market. On the contrary, Aquinas recognized that the purchasing power of money was bound to fluctuate, and was content if it fluctuated, as it usually did, more stably than did particular prices.

The author presents thought-provoking ideas on how individuals can be empowered to monetize their data and provides a vision for a future where data is managed in a fair and equitable manner.\n\nThe book is aimed at the general population and focuses on the topic of digital data, which has become an integral part of our lives. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the consequences of our actions related to data, including its potential misuse and abuse, and the responsibility of each individual to take control of their data. \n\nJohn argues that the data industry has devalued personal data and relegated it to a meaningless commodity, leading to a situation where companies act as if they own the data created by individuals. Thompson predicts that this situation will change in the near future and highlights the importance of individuals having control over their data.\n\nThe author also argues that individuals should be paid for the data they create and that there should be legislation and regulation to address data privacy concerns and promote a fairer distribution of the value of data. Thompson proposes a framework for data stewardship that takes public interest into consideration and suggests a public data commons model as one of the solutions.\n\n\n\n\n## Highlights\n- Data for All is written to be an accessible book that is easy to read for the general population. (Location 14)\n- digital data is a ubiquitous element in our lives. (Location 51)\n- The best we can do is be armed with knowledge, understand the possible ramifications of our actions, the implications of the length of the life of the data we are creating each and every minute of every day, the potential for misuse and abuse of the information and data once it is beyond our grasp and control. (Location 91)\n- Each of us is responsible for our data and for the lifecycle of our data. Whether we have ever thought about it or not, it is up to us to take control of our data and to actively make conscious choices (Location 101)\n- today. The data ecosystem was never intended to become what it is today. That is because the data ecosystem has organically and rapidly evolved over the past 30 years in a globally distributed manner due to the independent actions of corporations, (Location 112)\n- These millions of entities are acting on their own best, narrowly defined, interests. No one is driving the bus, and that needs to change. (Location 114)\n- the company HAD met the legal burden, but in the end, it is DNA data. DNA data, at least a complete genome, is the ultimate personal identifier, isn’t it? It is impossible to truly deidentify your complete genome. (Location 134)\n- So when you sign up for a service and provide your swab with your DNA sample, the control of your resulting data is not with the DNA firm you signed up with. The policies they originally posted mean little to nothing and can be changed at any time sometimes without notice to you. In (Location 154)\n- “[The] first rule of data: once you hand it over, you lose control of it. You have no idea how the terms of service will change for your ‘recreational’ DNA sample,”[5] (Location 162)\n- The work of Arthur and his company sounds interesting and innovative for the early 1920s and it was, but the important item for us to consider is that over time, the ACNielsen company convinced the grocery store operators to provide, at no cost, or at very low cost, to his company all of the sales records of each and every one of their stores. (Location 181)\n- The next evolution of the industry included the first generation of data brokers like InfoUSA and other firms that worked predominantly in the direct mail industry. The second generation of data brokers included Experian, Acxiom, and Epsilon. These three firms are mostly known in the arena of credit scores and understanding credit worthiness of individuals. And today we have the third generation of data brokers that are focused on collecting information from on-line activities. Activities that include location data, browsing behavior, and purchasing. (Location 187)\n- The precedence set in this instance is that as data ownership has almost no value it can be transferred from individuals to companies without the consent of the individuals that created the data. This precedence of devaluing data and relegating data to a status of a meaningless commodity is at the core of the situation we find ourselves in today as it relates to data. (Location 194)\n- In 2006, Humby coined the phrase “Data is the new oil”. Michael Palmer expanded on Humby's quote by saying, like oil, data is “valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used. Oil has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc. to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so, data must be broken down and analyzed for it to have value.”[10] (Location 212)\n- In 1998, Google was founded. This was one of the first instances of consumers obtaining a free online service in exchange for unfettered use of the data that the users themselves created. The (Location 218)\n- Shortly after the creation and release of the Google service, the founders reacted in a spectacularly unimaginative manner by deciding that their business model would be advertising based. Technologically, Google is an interesting company, but from a business model perspective, they are about as dull as dishwater because venture capitalists and financial analysts prefer stability and predictability in business operations. (Location 230)\n- ACNielsen founded his firm 70 years ago by gaining free access to sales data to analyze how to sell more groceries to people through more targeted, and refined pricing, better store assortments, and improved shelf space optimization. That ultimately led to targeting of radio and television advertising/ Today we are offered virtually the same thing on our computers over the internet with very little to no change in the underlying premise. (Location 233)\n- To them, we remain THE commodity to be sold, through our data. (Location 237)\n- The rights of individuals to own, protect, manage, and monetize their data has been usurped by a past that has little to no relevance to the data ecosystem we have today. (Location 246)\n- Companies around the world have acted like they own our data. That is not true and is only a temporary situation that will change in the near future. (Location 247)\n- Haugen leaked one Facebook study that found that 13.5% of U.K. teen girls in one survey say their suicidal thoughts became more frequent after starting on Instagram. Another leaked study found 17% of teen girls say their eating disorders got worse after using Instagram.”[19]About 32% of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse, Facebook's researchers found, which was first reported by the Journal. (Location 274)\n- The early founders of the data and analytics industry like Arthur Nielsen, Danny Moore, Wayne Levy, moved slowly at first, seeking to make money by selling insights on how to sell more household consumable goods. In the 90’s, analytics professionals were very careful to work on analytics that would help understand buyer behavior, assiduously avoiding unethical use cases. (Location 284)\n- our individual data is not that valuable and that it is like sand, ubiquitous and requiring much processing to make it valuable to firms and ultimately to us in the form of targeted messaging and advertising. (Location 313)\n- “Data is the New Sun is a more relevant analogy... as the sun can power an infinite number of uses at zero marginal cost, never wears out (or depreciates) and never depletes! At its heart, digital transformation is about economics: transitioning from yesterday’s “economics of oil” mentality (expensive to find, expensive to extract, expensive to transport, environmentally hazardous, depletes, messy, dirty, and environmental costly) to embracing the modern “economics of the sun” (clean, never depletes, never depreciates and is readily available to fuel an infinite number of uses).”[23] (Location 326)\n- “The most valuable asset of Uber, the ride-hailing service... is the data of the people who use it. The prime asset of Google, the largest library, which owns no physical library, is the index that takes customers to their desired websites. Therefore, the new valuable asset is not gold, but it is data. Data has become the new gold!”[24] The professor’s logic and arguments are solid and based in reality, but I do think they are limited in past historical thinking and are too limiting to the prospects of data. (Location 334)\n- Data exchanges, like stock exchanges, are where people and companies will congregate, virtually, to offer, buy and sell data in an open market. (Location 349)\n- data as “the new plastic”, because “we create a lot, we struggle to know what to do with it and it tends to turn up in the wrong places. And, for all the talk about the democratization of data, business is not yet culturally geared up to handle this. There’s a lot to do.”[27] (Location 356)\n- The characteristics of the sun and data are closely aligned in a physical and metaphorical sense. (Location 371)\n- People should be allowed to take an active part in the management/control, use, and monetization of their data. Today, individuals can engage in this process but it is disjointed, complicated, time consuming, and most people do not see the value in engaging the current process to limit and control their data. (Location 381)\n- Forward thinking governments have started to discuss the creation and regulation of data exchanges and data commons.[31] Companies will follow with offerings and capabilities where it will be simple for every person to make choices about the use of their data. These companies will make money from enabling individuals in the process of proactively managing, controlling, sharing, monetizing their data. (Location 386)\n- An informed population can and will make better decisions that can affect social change with this book and these ideas. (Location 393)\n- In western democracies, the idea of some all-knowing Big Brother is a fiction, no matter what some politicians tell you. The real problem is commercial companies, specifically the younger, more intelligent companies, (Location 566)\n- If we take the location data and we add the browsing data, now we have where you went, the routes you took, the time you spent at each location, and we have the products you viewed, the content you read, the various options you considered. Did (Location 633)\n- “Companies target me with offers and stories that I am not interested in. Therefore, they can’t be doing much with my data given how bad they are at understanding me and my true interests.” What individuals are missing is that companies are not good at understanding the difference between tangential and core interests today, but they are getting better and will get much better in the future. (Location 653)\n- It is important that we are clear that collecting data of all types and analyzing with ever increasing accuracy and speed is the goal of nearly all companies and will remain so for the foreseeable future. We cannot be complacent about the current lack of abilities (Location 658)\n- The most impressive firms and data science teams know and understand that the goal in all data collection efforts is to collect enough multi-faceted data about any person, behavior, or situation to be able to analyze, model, predict, prescribe, simulate, and optimize that situation to the interests of the parties executing the collecting and modeling activities. (Location 717)\n- The point is that the “free” services are not free. You are paying for them with your data and your agreement to allow these firms to observe, examine, aggregate, analyze, target, and sell you as a commodity. (Location 812)\n- “This new digital economy is described in a variety of ways: as a cognitive capitalism, where a systematic process of privatization of information in different forms allows for maximization of profits (Bauwens et al., 2019; Fumagalli et al., 2019), as a data colonialism, in which data is used to subjugate and transform social relations (Couldry \u0026 Mejias, 2019), or as a form of surveillance capitalism, in which various technological apparatuses monitor humans and try to predict and control human behavior for the sake of profit (Zuboff, 2019). (Location 841)\n- Those who do not have the luxury of considering the implications of sharing their data; those who live in poverty or make just enough to get by; those that are rarely in a position to worry about what is being done with their data. (Location 1023)\n- The goal here is moving people on the margin toward being aware, interested, caring, and actively engaged in understanding and acting on topics related to their data. (Location 1082)\n- Since you own your data, you have the full rights and abilities to grant or revoke a limited use license for your data. (Location 1115)\n- You can, in the future, revoke their right to use your data. That is the first step that GDPR has taken in relation to data owned by EU citizens. (Location 1117)\n- What if you don’t like how airline companies are contributing to climate change? You set the price of the use of your data for any airline to access and use your data in their operations, marketing and analytics efforts at 100 times, or a 1,000 times, or a million times the price that you would charge to a company that is involved in organic and sustainable farming, (Location 1129)\n- Children are being given electronic devices to distract them at younger and younger ages. These children are creating data and that data is being used to create new interfaces, new games, new modes of engagement; all of which are highly addictive. (Location 1157)\n- We asked how much the game cost. They responded that it was free. We explained that it did not cost them money to play the game, but that the game was not free. They asked what we meant. We went on to explain that they gave their name, age, e-mail address, location, and player activity to the company in order to play the game. (Location 1169)\n- We taught our children to think about their choices critically and proactively. That is all a parent can do. We should all be doing this with every child that we are responsible and accountable for. (Location 1194)\n- Personally, managing and monetizing your data is not possible today, but it will be in the coming years. (Location 1214)\n- Most people in the world do not have a stream or streams of passive income. “Passive income includes regular earnings from a source other than an employer or contractor. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says passive income can come from two sources: rental property or a business in which one does not actively participate, such as being paid book royalties or stock dividends,”[25] or a data dividend. Think about how nice that will be. Money for doing the things that you were going to do anyway and a stream of money that keeps coming each new week, month, or year. (Location 1217)\n- Data monetization stems from the concept of ownership of data held by the individuals that have created and are creating the data. (Location 1224)\n- The laws that are being drafted now envision that each person will be able to access the entire universe of their data and be able to set usage conditions and rules, monetary terms for each data element, date ranges of where data can used and where it cannot be used, exclusion lists of companies that cannot use your data, inclusion lists of preferred companies that can use your data as you have designated on preferred terms. (Location 1227)\n- You should be getting paid for the data you create on a regular and on-going basis, not the management teams of some random companies. (Location 1235)\n- What they do care about is corporate performance and growth, typically denominated in monetary terms. Yes, they all talk about products and services and helping the world, but it really comes down to the performance metrics around revenue. (Location 1242)\n- The data you create is yours and the revenue stream from that data should be yours. (Location 1243)\n- data or information has the following unique characteristics: · Is nonrivalrous · Is nondepleting · Is regenerative and nearly unlimited · Has relatively low inventory costs and transportation/transmission costs · Is more difficult to control and own · Is ecofriendly · If you spill it, you can’t clean it up[28] Data is truly and radically different than other commodities that the world has known in the past and should be treated in new and substantially different ways. (Location 1277)\n- “Typically, in the UK people trust the government and don’t trust [the tech] industry, and in the US people trust industry and don’t trust the government,” he says. More should be done to assuage fears about how tech giants handle user data, he adds. “To an extent, it’s how people are brought up and therefore cultural. But for people in the UK to trust these large American companies then you need to have serious legislation and regulation.”[32] (Location 1302)\n- The economic, social, monetary, and societal value of data will be more evenly distributed across societies, groups, and individuals. Understand, know and become a part of this movement. Talk about it at social gatherings. Post on social media. Talk with your professional colleagues who are involved in the lifecycle of any and all data. Reach out to your elected government officials and tell them that legislation related to data and your rights needs to be a priority, because (Location 1311)\n- Social media does a significant amount of damage to the world by algorithmically targeting people in the developing world with messages of division. Those people would benefit the most from a data dividend. (Location 1316)\n- One of the goals of these programs is slow or stop change that enables individuals to access, manage, and monetize their data. These lobbying efforts and associated proposals are very well designed, funded, planned, and are being executed in an orchestrated manner that is designed counter to improving access to data. (Location 1466)\n- There is opposition to change in the world of data from entities that profit from today's data ecosystem. (Location 1480)\n- When I was an adolescent it seemed the majority of people trusted our system of government or democracy; the US government, the media, our schools, and most of the institutions that make up American society to do what is in the best interest of we as individuals, the country, and the world. This was one aspect of what was referred to as American Exceptionalism.[4] (Location 1540)\n- By the end of the 1970s, only about a quarter of Americans felt that they could trust the government at least most of the time.”[5] (Location 1546)\n- Figure (Location 1548)\n- Autocratic leaders tend to be interested in shielding the public from data, making government operations more opaque and generally trend toward secrecy rather than openness.

(Location 1600)\n- Like many Americans, Veselka’s daily life is saturated with the products and services pushed by big technology companies, paid and free. (Location 1629)\n- One of the major problems in the technology market is that there are not enough compelling options for the population to choose from. (Location 1665)\n- Internet companies, by contrast, got an exemption in the now-notorious Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which says content created by users is not the responsibility of web platforms. (Location 1677)\n- I believe that our data has the same type of intrinsic value and that we should be paid each and every time a data element that we have created is used. Perhaps we are paid a millionth of a penny, or perhaps we set the rate for what we are paid by the type of organization that wants to use our data. We will delve into this topic more deeply later in the book, but I wanted to make the comparison to music royalties (Location 1779)\n- our data has value, we should be paid when our data is used in a manner that delivers revenue and profit to any commercial organization. (Location 1782)\n- The concept is being discussed today and one name that is used to refer to the idea in practice is a data dividend. How would you like to get a check each month or every year for the use of your data? (Location 1784)\n- I believe individuals should be empowered to and should be able to easily set the price of our data used in each industry, company, and application. (Location 1786)\n- “The public sphere needs an ‘ecosystem of trust’ which could set out objectives of re-usage of data for the common good while protecting individual rights... related to data, asserting that the systemic level of data assemblage must be re-conceptualized to reject the data-as-a-commodity view and take public interest into consideration. For data stewardship to achieve its goals, it is necessary to consider the inherent properties of data as commons... framework....[A] public data commons as the model that is best suited to secure European rights and values while increasing data sharing at the same time.”[27] (Location 1838)\n- The Data Governance Act is a single step toward creating data commons that will collect data with the express purpose of using that data for public good and the good of everyone involved and not in just some conceptual manner, but in a tangible monetary manner for each EU citizen. (Location 1857)\n- The Data Act will be a major new initiative to ensure fairness by providing better control for data sharing to citizens and businesses. [Through the Data] Act, users will have more control over the data they generate via their smart objects and EU businesses more possibilities to compete and innovate and easily transfer data between service providers. The Data Act will aim at clarifying for EU consumers and businesses who can use and access what data for which purposes. (Location 1861)\n- One portion of the Data Governance Act (DGA) that is noteworthy are the clauses which outline the creation of Data Intermediaries (DI) also known as data cooperatives or data unions.[30] These are the institutions, organizations and frameworks that will enable citizens, EU citizens in the beginning, to take control of their data to move, aggregate, share and monetize the data as they wish. (Location 1869)\n- The overall level of trust granted these organizations by the general public is at an all-time low. These organizations are actively perpetuating a system the source of significant and valuable raw material, the users. We do not tolerate companies that egregiously exploit natural resources for the gain of a few. We should not tolerate the same abuse of our data going forward. (Location 2024)\n- We skimmed the surface of legislative and regulatory efforts from the governments in Europe, Australia, and the United States relating to our data. (Location 2027)\n- Privacy relates to freedom of choice and control in the sphere of one’s personal information– choices regarding what information you wish to share and, perhaps more important, what you do not want shared with others. (Location 2255)\n- Some defend privacy as focusing on control over information about oneself (Parent, 1983), while others defend it as a broader concept required for human dignity (Bloustein, 1964), or crucial for intimacy (Gerstein, 1978; Inness, 1992). Other commentators defend privacy as necessary for the development of varied and meaningful interpersonal relationships (Location 2269)\n- Think about the activities where you seek privacy and the motivating factors for why you seek it. Now overlay those activities with your online activities. Where is the intersection of your desire for privacy and your online activities? Would you want more control to access, modify or delete data related to those activities? Would you want to charge companies more money to access your data related to those activities, or would you prefer to block all companies from accessing that data? (Location 2299)\n- appears that privacy exhibits many of the characteristics of sleep. (Location 2331)\n- Privacy and secrecy are often confused. (Location 2340)\n- Privacy is consensual where secrecy is not; that is, there is a “right to privacy” but no equivalent “right to secrecy.” Those stigmatized or disadvantaged social groups who have little or no access to privacy utilize secrecy to conceal their behavior.”[23] (Location 2342)\n- When people know they are deprived of the right of privacy they will feel anxious, nervous, and worried about concealing data and information that may disadvantage them or their loved ones, colleagues, or compatriots. (Location 2348)\n- Privacy enables people to withdraw information, and/or their physical self, from the public view. (Location 2363)\n- People talk about and profess that they want a high degree of privacy, but then they regularly act in ways that actively reduces or eliminates the degree of privacy that they actually have. It is a paradox, (Location 2387)\n- “Large, complex organizations use data-sharing platforms to facilitate collaboration on data-driven projects, both within and between organizations. (Location 2744)\n- “It was long unanimously held among economists that natural resources that were collectively used by their users would be over-exploited and destroyed in the long-term. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters, and forests. She showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.”[9] (Location 2830)\n- Her work created a new understanding of the actual delineation between common resources and private property. She and her colleagues clarified and codified how organically organized groups optimized the management of common resources for long term sustainability in opposition to the previously held theory that all common pool resources would be exploited, depleted, and most likely destroyed. (Location 2843)\n- From the work of Elinor Ostrom, and others, the advocates of Open Data and Open Software extended her research, findings and insights from forestry, irrigation, and policing systems to the new worlds of data and software. (Location 2849)\n- Knowledge is open if anyone is free to access, use, modify, and share it— subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness.”[14] (Location 2860)\n- Open Data evolved in conjunction and in parallel with the concept of Open-Source Software (Location 2874)\n- The OKF is a not-for-profit organization that works to communicate, train and bring about the use of open data on a global basis. The mission of the OKF is, “to create a more open world– a world where all non-personal information is open, free for everyone to use, build on and share; and creators and innovators are fairly recognized and rewarded.”[19] It is worthwhile to note that the OKF’s mission exempts personal information from their definition of open. (Location 2893)\n- Open Data is an economic imperative that can drive a level of value generation such that it can be a driving force in lifting sections of populations and younger generations out of poverty. Open Data needs to be ubiquitous across all governments and all relevant data, and it will be in the coming years. (Location 2948)\n- “Data exchanges are emerging as a key component of the data economy. By connecting data suppliers and consumers through a seamless experience, data exchanges have created a modern-day gold rush to help modern, digital organizations address their insatiable hunger for data. And, by eliminating the friction from finding, acquiring, and integrating data, these exchanges make it easy for any company to monetize its data assets and create new revenue streams.”[27] (Location 2971)\n- The Shanghai Data Exchange was established to address the major difficulties in data trading including identification of data ownership, pricing of data, reaching mutual trust between transaction parties, initiating transactions and overall supervision, said local authorities.[30] (Location 2982)\n- 3. Data Marketplace - A data marketplace is a public data exchange open to any company that wants to supply or consume data. Some marketplaces are global in scope, spanning every industry, function, and type of data.[31] (Location 2994)\n- “Data intermediation services would include... data pools established jointly by several legal or natural persons with the intention to license the use of such a pool to all interested parties in a manner that all participants contributing to the pool would receive a reward for their contribution to the pool.”[32] (Location 3008)\n- One company that is working toward creating data unions that can be managed in a unified and consistent manner is Pooldata.io.[34] (Location 3027)\n- Data lineage is the same as your genealogical lineage. When new data is created from existing data; or generated from raw, aggregated, or other natural source of data, the new data has a lineage— a connection to the source or original data. (Location 3258)\n- Tracking data lineage is not hard to do. It simply requires keeping records of how data was created and where that data has been used. The new data world will create a new market for existing and expanded data lineage products and services. (Location 3269)\n- I expect that the royalty payments for our part in derived data will be less than naturally occurring data, but we will be paid, nonetheless. (Location 3310)\n- Synthetic data is created from our view of the world. We do not use existing data in the creation of synthetic data, we simply generate the data that we believe we need. (Location 3313)\n- Much of the synthetic data created today is created by using algorithms. Originally, we would create the data by hand from copying and extending data that we knew was close to or approximates the raw data. (Location 3324)\n- When I am executing consulting work, I ask for the rights to the simulation data, and most people are happy to sign those rights over to my consulting firm. If I am employed at a full-time job and I oversee this type of work, I ensure that all the (Location 3348)\n- most data that is created soon will be created without any human intervention. The data will be created in machine-to-machine interfaces and the data will be created, stored, managed, used, and analyzed without any humans being in the loop. (Location 3377)\n- Earlier I remarked that I did not view the early stages of the analytics continuum as true analytics, I still hold this to be true, but I wanted to include these early stages for clarity as to where the analytics continuum begins. (Location 3399)\n- Prescriptive models prescribe the actions that business executives, managers and subject matter experts should take. (Location 3431)\n- Based on the data used in the prediction/prescription efforts, data science teams build simulation systems that enable business users to vary their assumptions and plans. The simulation system is run many times to see which of their plans, ideas and visions produce the best business outcomes. (Location 3437)\n- simulation environments enable business managers to gain confidence that they are seeing the projected performance of markets, companies, products, and customers in a safe environment. Business managers can try sets of plans and variables that they have seen before in real world markets. They can validate the models are producing accurate results and empower business users to create new and interesting scenarios delivering a competitive advantage. (Location 3444)\n- Digital Twins[5] are an area of simulation that is widely used and has provided significant benefits to organizations around the world. (Location 3450)\n- Optimization models and applications build on all the preceding levels of data and analytics sophistication that we have discussed. (Location 3453)\n- Optimization models and applications analyze the billions and trillions of simulations and recommend the best course of action that is aligned with the business outcomes and objectives stated as the best outcome by the business executives, managers and subject matter experts. (Location 3459)\n- Data scientists are innovators, creators of change, drivers of transformation. We do not want statisticians to be data scientists, and the reverse is true as well. There are roles for both and we need and want both, but let’s not confuse the two. (Location 3486)\n- Do not hire a data scientist to execute purely statistical work and do not hire a statistician to be a data scientist. (Location 3487)\n- As with most changes in the world, data won’t change in a big bang. Not all factors will change in an instant. The world at large; laws, regulations, enforcement, business operations, attitudes and compliance does not change in the blink of an eye. (Location 3561)\n- · The current trend in consumer sentiment against being tracked, targeted, and messaged to with irrelevant offers, messages, and divisive content will continue to be of concern to a significant portion of the population. (Location 3634)\n- DIs will have access to data from millions of people, the DIs will constantly analyze the data, to glean insights on sources of demand, price points, access frequency, industries, and companies. If the laws around the world follow the EU model, DIs will be prohibited from selling data. (Location 3827)\n- Since they can’t sell data, they will be committed to their goal of making your data accessible, usable, valuable, and easy to leverage by you and the companies that want to use our data in their commercial efforts. (Location 3830)\n- DIs will be able to tell you which groups and categories of data are in demand and the market price that is being paid for that data. (Location 3833)\n- Integrating your data into larger groups can be done within your data sets. Combining your purchase data category with your browsing data category, would be a common integration. Integrating your in-store grocery purchases with your online grocery purchases would provide a complete wallet share of your grocery spending. Integrating data can be done with data of other people who have similar and/or dissimilar habits, lifestyles or economic status and can be done in many ways using the following dimensions (Location 3849)\n- As we have been discussing, you will be managing your data through your relationship with a DI. You will have several objectives and goals that help you align the deployment and use of your data with your values. If you are concerned about global warming, you can make your data or any subset of your data available to firms that support improving the global climate on very advantageous terms, you might even be able to pay those firms for using your data. (Location 3872)\n- Data is very different from the traditional commodities that we are accustomed to, it doesn’t wear out, it gets more valuable as you accumulate it, it can be integrated in unlimited ways, it is easily transported around the world with almost no cost, and it has unique scarcity/abundance properties. For all these reasons, the view we need to take on monetizing data is different than if we were thinking about gold, oil, cash, or diamonds. (Location 3903)\n- Doug Laney[12] has written the definitive book on understanding the underlying economics of data. The book is called, Infonomics[13]. (Location 3906)\n- Your economic status will play a part in the value placed on your data in the open market. People who buy and spend more and in greater amounts will probably be paid more than those who buy and spend less in lesser amounts, but that is from a purely commercial perspective. (Location 3932)\n- Your health status will play a part in valuing your data. People who have rare diseases or highly unusual blood types or disorders may be able to demand a premium price for their diagnostic, prescription history, medical records and genetic material and sequencing. (Location 3934)\n- “What if Facebook was an equitable business partner that shared half of its profit with those of us who actually provide the data that makes its business model run? Using my math (which is, again, open to debate), the average Facebook user would earn $10.77 per quarter. But, what if you are a more active user than average? Twice as active? Five times as active? Out of curiosity, I broke the numbers down below. · Half as active: $5.38 · Twice as active: $21.53 · Five times as active: $53.83 (Location 3942)\n- I believe, and I could be way off in my estimate of the annual data dividend, but in my view, there could be people who make over $20,000 to $50,000 or more each year from licensing their personal data. (Location 3954)\n- Take note of the word licensing. You will not sell your data to companies; you will license it. You will retain ownership of the data and you will provide a limited use license to your data. (Location 3956)\n- First, don’t do business with companies that you know are hurting you, your families, your communities, your country, and the world. If you are involved with such a company, stop using their service, delete all your data, tell all your friends to stop using the platform. (Location 3991)\n- Second, sign up for every “do not mail” list that you can. It doesn’t take long, and it really works. Most of our discussions have been about online data and that is the most important category, but companies still mail a significant amount of material and the lists and data being held by those companies is significant, and those companies are the most aggressive resellers of your data. (Location 3993)\n- sign up for every “do not call” list that you can. The results are the same as above, but just on your mobile device. (Location 4001)\n- I wanted all of you to know that the world of data that we live in today did not come about by happenstance, it was designed and built on purpose. (Location 4012)\n- I am keen for everyone to know about the flawed data ownership model that has persisted since the beginning of the modern data industry. (Location 4022)\n- I felt and feel that it was and is important for you to know and understand how trust plays an important role in your relationship with your data and the organizations that want to use your data. As with all relationships, we need to have a baseline of trust. (Location 4031)\n- I feel that it is imperative for the people who will read this book to be aware of the massive, latent amount of economic value that will be created through the new world of data and that the economic value should be more evenly distributed, (Location 4037)\n---\nauthor: [[John Thompson]]\ntitle: \"Data for All\"\ntags: \n- books\n- literature-note\n---\n# Data for All\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/default-book-icon-8.18caceaece2b.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[John Thompson]]\n- Full Title: Data for All\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- Data for All is written to be an accessible book that is easy to read for the general population. (Location 14)\n- digital data is a ubiquitous element in our lives. (Location 51)\n- The best we can do is be armed with knowledge, understand the possible ramifications of our actions, the implications of the length of the life of the data we are creating each and every minute of every day, the potential for misuse and abuse of the information and data once it is beyond our grasp and control. (Location 91)\n- Each of us is responsible for our data and for the lifecycle of our data. Whether we have ever thought about it or not, it is up to us to take control of our data and to actively make conscious choices (Location 101)\n- today. The data ecosystem was never intended to become what it is today. That is because the data ecosystem has organically and rapidly evolved over the past 30 years in a globally distributed manner due to the independent actions of corporations, (Location 112)\n- These millions of entities are acting on their own best, narrowly defined, interests. No one is driving the bus, and that needs to change. (Location 114)\n- the company HAD met the legal burden, but in the end, it is DNA data. DNA data, at least a complete genome, is the ultimate personal identifier, isn’t it? It is impossible to truly deidentify your complete genome. (Location 134)\n- So when you sign up for a service and provide your swab with your DNA sample, the control of your resulting data is not with the DNA firm you signed up with. The policies they originally posted mean little to nothing and can be changed at any time sometimes without notice to you. In (Location 154)\n- “[The] first rule of data: once you hand it over, you lose control of it. You have no idea how the terms of service will change for your ‘recreational’ DNA sample,”[5] (Location 162)\n- The work of Arthur and his company sounds interesting and innovative for the early 1920s and it was, but the important item for us to consider is that over time, the ACNielsen company convinced the grocery store operators to provide, at no cost, or at very low cost, to his company all of the sales records of each and every one of their stores. (Location 181)\n- The next evolution of the industry included the first generation of data brokers like InfoUSA and other firms that worked predominantly in the direct mail industry. The second generation of data brokers included Experian, Acxiom, and Epsilon. These three firms are mostly known in the arena of credit scores and understanding credit worthiness of individuals. And today we have the third generation of data brokers that are focused on collecting information from on-line activities. Activities that include location data, browsing behavior, and purchasing. (Location 187)\n- The precedence set in this instance is that as data ownership has almost no value it can be transferred from individuals to companies without the consent of the individuals that created the data. This precedence of devaluing data and relegating data to a status of a meaningless commodity is at the core of the situation we find ourselves in today as it relates to data. (Location 194)\n- In 2006, Humby coined the phrase “Data is the new oil”. Michael Palmer expanded on Humby's quote by saying, like oil, data is “valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used. Oil has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc. to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so, data must be broken down and analyzed for it to have value.”[10] (Location 212)\n- In 1998, Google was founded. This was one of the first instances of consumers obtaining a free online service in exchange for unfettered use of the data that the users themselves created. The (Location 218)\n- Shortly after the creation and release of the Google service, the founders reacted in a spectacularly unimaginative manner by deciding that their business model would be advertising based. Technologically, Google is an interesting company, but from a business model perspective, they are about as dull as dishwater because venture capitalists and financial analysts prefer stability and predictability in business operations. (Location 230)\n- ACNielsen founded his firm 70 years ago by gaining free access to sales data to analyze how to sell more groceries to people through more targeted, and refined pricing, better store assortments, and improved shelf space optimization. That ultimately led to targeting of radio and television advertising/ Today we are offered virtually the same thing on our computers over the internet with very little to no change in the underlying premise. (Location 233)\n- To them, we remain THE commodity to be sold, through our data. (Location 237)\n- The rights of individuals to own, protect, manage, and monetize their data has been usurped by a past that has little to no relevance to the data ecosystem we have today. (Location 246)\n- Companies around the world have acted like they own our data. That is not true and is only a temporary situation that will change in the near future. (Location 247)\n- Haugen leaked one Facebook study that found that 13.5% of U.K. teen girls in one survey say their suicidal thoughts became more frequent after starting on Instagram. Another leaked study found 17% of teen girls say their eating disorders got worse after using Instagram.”[19]About 32% of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse, Facebook's researchers found, which was first reported by the Journal. (Location 274)\n- The early founders of the data and analytics industry like Arthur Nielsen, Danny Moore, Wayne Levy, moved slowly at first, seeking to make money by selling insights on how to sell more household consumable goods. In the 90’s, analytics professionals were very careful to work on analytics that would help understand buyer behavior, assiduously avoiding unethical use cases. (Location 284)\n- our individual data is not that valuable and that it is like sand, ubiquitous and requiring much processing to make it valuable to firms and ultimately to us in the form of targeted messaging and advertising. (Location 313)\n- “Data is the New Sun is a more relevant analogy... as the sun can power an infinite number of uses at zero marginal cost, never wears out (or depreciates) and never depletes! At its heart, digital transformation is about economics: transitioning from yesterday’s “economics of oil” mentality (expensive to find, expensive to extract, expensive to transport, environmentally hazardous, depletes, messy, dirty, and environmental costly) to embracing the modern “economics of the sun” (clean, never depletes, never depreciates and is readily available to fuel an infinite number of uses).”[23] (Location 326)\n- “The most valuable asset of Uber, the ride-hailing service... is the data of the people who use it. The prime asset of Google, the largest library, which owns no physical library, is the index that takes customers to their desired websites. Therefore, the new valuable asset is not gold, but it is data. Data has become the new gold!”[24] The professor’s logic and arguments are solid and based in reality, but I do think they are limited in past historical thinking and are too limiting to the prospects of data. (Location 334)\n- Data exchanges, like stock exchanges, are where people and companies will congregate, virtually, to offer, buy and sell data in an open market. (Location 349)\n- data as “the new plastic”, because “we create a lot, we struggle to know what to do with it and it tends to turn up in the wrong places. And, for all the talk about the democratization of data, business is not yet culturally geared up to handle this. There’s a lot to do.”[27] (Location 356)\n- The characteristics of the sun and data are closely aligned in a physical and metaphorical sense. (Location 371)\n- People should be allowed to take an active part in the management/control, use, and monetization of their data. Today, individuals can engage in this process but it is disjointed, complicated, time consuming, and most people do not see the value in engaging the current process to limit and control their data. (Location 381)\n- Forward thinking governments have started to discuss the creation and regulation of data exchanges and data commons.[31] Companies will follow with offerings and capabilities where it will be simple for every person to make choices about the use of their data. These companies will make money from enabling individuals in the process of proactively managing, controlling, sharing, monetizing their data. (Location 386)\n- An informed population can and will make better decisions that can affect social change with this book and these ideas. (Location 393)\n- In western democracies, the idea of some all-knowing Big Brother is a fiction, no matter what some politicians tell you. The real problem is commercial companies, specifically the younger, more intelligent companies, (Location 566)\n- If we take the location data and we add the browsing data, now we have where you went, the routes you took, the time you spent at each location, and we have the products you viewed, the content you read, the various options you considered. Did (Location 633)\n- “Companies target me with offers and stories that I am not interested in. Therefore, they can’t be doing much with my data given how bad they are at understanding me and my true interests.” What individuals are missing is that companies are not good at understanding the difference between tangential and core interests today, but they are getting better and will get much better in the future. (Location 653)\n- It is important that we are clear that collecting data of all types and analyzing with ever increasing accuracy and speed is the goal of nearly all companies and will remain so for the foreseeable future. We cannot be complacent about the current lack of abilities (Location 658)\n- The most impressive firms and data science teams know and understand that the goal in all data collection efforts is to collect enough multi-faceted data about any person, behavior, or situation to be able to analyze, model, predict, prescribe, simulate, and optimize that situation to the interests of the parties executing the collecting and modeling activities. (Location 717)\n- The point is that the “free” services are not free. You are paying for them with your data and your agreement to allow these firms to observe, examine, aggregate, analyze, target, and sell you as a commodity. (Location 812)\n- “This new digital economy is described in a variety of ways: as a cognitive capitalism, where a systematic process of privatization of information in different forms allows for maximization of profits (Bauwens et al., 2019; Fumagalli et al., 2019), as a data colonialism, in which data is used to subjugate and transform social relations (Couldry \u0026 Mejias, 2019), or as a form of surveillance capitalism, in which various technological apparatuses monitor humans and try to predict and control human behavior for the sake of profit (Zuboff, 2019). (Location 841)\n- Those who do not have the luxury of considering the implications of sharing their data; those who live in poverty or make just enough to get by; those that are rarely in a position to worry about what is being done with their data.

(Location 1082)\n- Since you own your data, you have the full rights and abilities to grant or revoke a limited use license for your data. (Location 1115)\n- You can, in the future, revoke their right to use your data. That is the first step that GDPR has taken in relation to data owned by EU citizens. (Location 1117)\n- What if you don’t like how airline companies are contributing to climate change? You set the price of the use of your data for any airline to access and use your data in their operations, marketing and analytics efforts at 100 times, or a 1,000 times, or a million times the price that you would charge to a company that is involved in organic and sustainable farming, (Location 1129)\n- Children are being given electronic devices to distract them at younger and younger ages. These children are creating data and that data is being used to create new interfaces, new games, new modes of engagement; all of which are highly addictive. (Location 1157)\n- We asked how much the game cost. They responded that it was free. We explained that it did not cost them money to play the game, but that the game was not free. They asked what we meant. We went on to explain that they gave their name, age, e-mail address, location, and player activity to the company in order to play the game. (Location 1169)\n- We taught our children to think about their choices critically and proactively. That is all a parent can do. We should all be doing this with every child that we are responsible and accountable for. (Location 1194)\n- Personally, managing and monetizing your data is not possible today, but it will be in the coming years. (Location 1214)\n- Most people in the world do not have a stream or streams of passive income. “Passive income includes regular earnings from a source other than an employer or contractor. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says passive income can come from two sources: rental property or a business in which one does not actively participate, such as being paid book royalties or stock dividends,”[25] or a data dividend. Think about how nice that will be. Money for doing the things that you were going to do anyway and a stream of money that keeps coming each new week, month, or year. (Location 1217)\n- Data monetization stems from the concept of ownership of data held by the individuals that have created and are creating the data. (Location 1224)\n- The laws that are being drafted now envision that each person will be able to access the entire universe of their data and be able to set usage conditions and rules, monetary terms for each data element, date ranges of where data can used and where it cannot be used, exclusion lists of companies that cannot use your data, inclusion lists of preferred companies that can use your data as you have designated on preferred terms. (Location 1227)\n- You should be getting paid for the data you create on a regular and on-going basis, not the management teams of some random companies. (Location 1235)\n- What they do care about is corporate performance and growth, typically denominated in monetary terms.

More should be done to assuage fears about how tech giants handle user data, he adds. “To an extent, it’s how people are brought up and therefore cultural. But for people in the UK to trust these large American companies then you need to have serious legislation and regulation.”[32] (Location 1302)\n- The economic, social, monetary, and societal value of data will be more evenly distributed across societies, groups, and individuals. Understand, know and become a part of this movement. Talk about it at social gatherings. Post on social media.

Reach out to your elected government officials and tell them that legislation related to data and your rights needs to be a priority, because (Location 1311)\n- Social media does a significant amount of damage to the world by algorithmically targeting people in the developing world with messages of division. Those people would benefit the most from a data dividend.

These lobbying efforts and associated proposals are very well designed, funded, planned, and are being executed in an orchestrated manner that is designed counter to improving access to data. (Location 1466)\n- There is opposition to change in the world of data from entities that profit from today's data ecosystem. (Location 1480)\n- When I was an adolescent it seemed the majority of people trusted our system of government or democracy; the US government, the media, our schools, and most of the institutions that make up American society to do what is in the best interest of we as individuals, the country, and the world. This was one aspect of what was referred to as American Exceptionalism.[4] (Location 1540)\n- By the end of the 1970s, only about a quarter of Americans felt that they could trust the government at least most of the time.”[5] (Location 1546)\n- Figure (Location 1548)\n- Autocratic leaders tend to be interested in shielding the public from data, making government operations more opaque and generally trend toward secrecy rather than openness.

(Location 1600)\n- Like many Americans, Veselka’s daily life is saturated with the products and services pushed by big technology companies, paid and free. (Location 1629)\n- One of the major problems in the technology market is that there are not enough compelling options for the population to choose from. (Location 1665)\n- Internet companies, by contrast, got an exemption in the now-notorious Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which says content created by users is not the responsibility of web platforms. (Location 1677)\n- I believe that our data has the same type of intrinsic value and that we should be paid each and every time a data element that we have created is used. Perhaps we are paid a millionth of a penny, or perhaps we set the rate for what we are paid by the type of organization that wants to use our data. We will delve into this topic more deeply later in the book, but I wanted to make the comparison to music royalties (Location 1779)\n- our data has value, we should be paid when our data is used in a manner that delivers revenue and profit to any commercial organization.

How would you like to get a check each month or every year for the use of your data? (Location 1784)\n- I believe individuals should be empowered to and should be able to easily set the price of our data used in each industry, company, and application. (Location 1786)\n- “The public sphere needs an ‘ecosystem of trust’ which could set out objectives of re-usage of data for the common good while protecting individual rights... related to data, asserting that the systemic level of data assemblage must be re-conceptualized to reject the data-as-a-commodity view and take public interest into consideration. For data stewardship to achieve its goals, it is necessary to consider the inherent properties of data as commons... framework....[A] public data commons as the model that is best suited to secure European rights and values while increasing data sharing at the same time.”[27] (Location 1838)\n- The Data Governance Act is a single step toward creating data commons that will collect data with the express purpose of using that data for public good and the good of everyone involved and not in just some conceptual manner, but in a tangible monetary manner for each EU citizen. (Location 1857)\n- The Data Act will be a major new initiative to ensure fairness by providing better control for data sharing to citizens and businesses. [Through the Data] Act, users will have more control over the data they generate via their smart objects and EU businesses more possibilities to compete and innovate and easily transfer data between service providers. The Data Act will aim at clarifying for EU consumers and businesses who can use and access what data for which purposes. (Location 1861)\n- One portion of the Data Governance Act (DGA) that is noteworthy are the clauses which outline the creation of Data Intermediaries (DI) also known as data cooperatives or data unions.[30] These are the institutions, organizations and frameworks that will enable citizens, EU citizens in the beginning, to take control of their data to move, aggregate, share and monetize the data as they wish. (Location 1869)\n- The overall level of trust granted these organizations by the general public is at an all-time low. These organizations are actively perpetuating a system the source of significant and valuable raw material, the users. We do not tolerate companies that egregiously exploit natural resources for the gain of a few. We should not tolerate the same abuse of our data going forward. (Location 2024)\n- Privacy relates to freedom of choice and control in the sphere of one’s personal information– choices regarding what information you wish to share and, perhaps more important, what you do not want shared with others. (Location 2255)\n- Some defend privacy as focusing on control over information about oneself (Parent, 1983), while others defend it as a broader concept required for human dignity (Bloustein, 1964), or crucial for intimacy (Gerstein, 1978; Inness, 1992). Other commentators defend privacy as necessary for the development of varied and meaningful interpersonal relationships (Location 2269)\n- Think about the activities where you seek privacy and the motivating factors for why you seek it. Now overlay those activities with your online activities. Where is the intersection of your desire for privacy and your online activities? Would you want more control to access, modify or delete data related to those activities? Would you want to charge companies more money to access your data related to those activities, or would you prefer to block all companies from accessing that data? (Location 2299)\n- appears that privacy exhibits many of the characteristics of sleep. (Location 2331)\n- Privacy and secrecy are often confused. (Location 2340)\n- Privacy is consensual where secrecy is not; that is, there is a “right to privacy” but no equivalent “right to secrecy.” Those stigmatized or disadvantaged social groups who have little or no access to privacy utilize secrecy to conceal their behavior.”[23] (Location 2342)\n- When people know they are deprived of the right of privacy they will feel anxious, nervous, and worried about concealing data and information that may disadvantage them or their loved ones, colleagues, or compatriots. (Location 2348)\n- Privacy enables people to withdraw information, and/or their physical self, from the public view. (Location 2363)\n- People talk about and profess that they want a high degree of privacy, but then they regularly act in ways that actively reduces or eliminates the degree of privacy that they actually have. It is a paradox, (Location 2387)\n- “Large, complex organizations use data-sharing platforms to facilitate collaboration on data-driven projects, both within and between organizations. (Location 2744)\n- “It was long unanimously held among economists that natural resources that were collectively used by their users would be over-exploited and destroyed in the long-term. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters, and forests. She showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.”[9] (Location 2830)\n- Her work created a new understanding of the actual delineation between common resources and private property. She and her colleagues clarified and codified how organically organized groups optimized the management of common resources for long term sustainability in opposition to the previously held theory that all common pool resources would be exploited, depleted, and most likely destroyed. (Location 2843)\n- From the work of Elinor Ostrom, and others, the advocates of Open Data and Open Software extended her research, findings and insights from forestry, irrigation, and policing systems to the new worlds of data and software. (Location 2849)\n- Knowledge is open if anyone is free to access, use, modify, and share it— subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness.”[14] (Location 2860)\n- Open Data evolved in conjunction and in parallel with the concept of Open-Source Software (Location 2874)\n- The OKF is a not-for-profit organization that works to communicate, train and bring about the use of open data on a global basis. The mission of the OKF is, “to create a more open world– a world where all non-personal information is open, free for everyone to use, build on and share; and creators and innovators are fairly recognized and rewarded.”[19] It is worthwhile to note that the OKF’s mission exempts personal information from their definition of open. (Location 2893)\n- Open Data is an economic imperative that can drive a level of value generation such that it can be a driving force in lifting sections of populations and younger generations out of poverty. Open Data needs to be ubiquitous across all governments and all relevant data, and it will be in the coming years. (Location 2948)\n- “Data exchanges are emerging as a key component of the data economy. By connecting data suppliers and consumers through a seamless experience, data exchanges have created a modern-day gold rush to help modern, digital organizations address their insatiable hunger for data. And, by eliminating the friction from finding, acquiring, and integrating data, these exchanges make it easy for any company to monetize its data assets and create new revenue streams.”[27] (Location 2971)\n- The Shanghai Data Exchange was established to address the major difficulties in data trading including identification of data ownership, pricing of data, reaching mutual trust between transaction parties, initiating transactions and overall supervision, said local authorities.[30] (Location 2982)\n- 3. Data Marketplace - A data marketplace is a public data exchange open to any company that wants to supply or consume data. Some marketplaces are global in scope, spanning every industry, function, and type of data.[31] (Location 2994)\n- “Data intermediation services would include... data pools established jointly by several legal or natural persons with the intention to license the use of such a pool to all interested parties in a manner that all participants contributing to the pool would receive a reward for their contribution to the pool.”[32] (Location 3008)\n- One company that is working toward creating data unions that can be managed in a unified and consistent manner is Pooldata.io.[34] (Location 3027)\n- Data lineage is the same as your genealogical lineage. When new data is created from existing data; or generated from raw, aggregated, or other natural source of data, the new data has a lineage— a connection to the source or original data. (Location 3258)\n- Tracking data lineage is not hard to do. It simply requires keeping records of how data was created and where that data has been used. The new data world will create a new market for existing and expanded data lineage products and services. (Location 3269)\n- I expect that the royalty payments for our part in derived data will be less than naturally occurring data, but we will be paid, nonetheless. (Location 3310)\n- Synthetic data is created from our view of the world. We do not use existing data in the creation of synthetic data, we simply generate the data that we believe we need.

(Location 3399)\n- Prescriptive models prescribe the actions that business executives, managers and subject matter experts should take. (Location 3431)\n- Based on the data used in the prediction/prescription efforts, data science teams build simulation systems that enable business users to vary their assumptions and plans. The simulation system is run many times to see which of their plans, ideas and visions produce the best business outcomes.

(Location 3830)\n- DIs will be able to tell you which groups and categories of data are in demand and the market price that is being paid for that data. (Location 3833)\n- Integrating your data into larger groups can be done within your data sets. Combining your purchase data category with your browsing data category, would be a common integration. Integrating your in-store grocery purchases with your online grocery purchases would provide a complete wallet share of your grocery spending. Integrating data can be done with data of other people who have similar and/or dissimilar habits, lifestyles or economic status and can be done in many ways using the following dimensions (Location 3849)\n- As we have been discussing, you will be managing your data through your relationship with a DI. You will have several objectives and goals that help you align the deployment and use of your data with your values. If you are concerned about global warming, you can make your data or any subset of your data available to firms that support improving the global climate on very advantageous terms, you might even be able to pay those firms for using your data.

The second generation of data brokers included Experian, Acxiom, and Epsilon. These three firms are mostly known in the arena of credit scores and understanding credit worthiness of individuals. And today we have the third generation of data brokers that are focused on collecting information from on-line activities. Activities that include location data, browsing behavior, and purchasing.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says passive income can come from two sources: rental property or a business in which one does not actively participate, such as being paid book royalties or stock dividends,”[25] or a data dividend. Think about how nice that will be. Money for doing the things that you were going to do anyway and a stream of money that keeps coming each new week, month, or year.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says passive income can come from two sources: rental property or a business in which one does not actively participate, such as being paid book royalties or stock dividends,”[25] or a data dividend. Think about how nice that will be. Money for doing the things that you were going to do anyway and a stream of money that keeps coming each new week, month, or year. (Location 1217)\n- Data monetization stems from the concept of ownership of data held by the individuals that have created and are creating the data.

[Through the Data] Act, users will have more control over the data they generate via their smart objects and EU businesses more possibilities to compete and innovate and easily transfer data between service providers. The Data Act will aim at clarifying for EU consumers and businesses who can use and access what data for which purposes. (Location 1861)\n- One portion of the Data Governance Act (DGA) that is noteworthy are the clauses which outline the creation of Data Intermediaries (DI) also known as data cooperatives or data unions.[30] These are the institutions, organizations and frameworks that will enable citizens, EU citizens in the beginning, to take control of their data to move, aggregate, share and monetize the data as they wish.

Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters, and forests. She showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.”[9] (Location 2830)\n- Her work created a new understanding of the actual delineation between common resources and private property. She and her colleagues clarified and codified how organically organized groups optimized the management of common resources for long term sustainability in opposition to the previously held theory that all common pool resources would be exploited, depleted, and most likely destroyed.

What are the reasons that make knowledge workers lose their familiarity with it? What is the consequence of spending too much time on shallow work?\n\nDeep work is a professional activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that pushes cognitive capabilities to their limit. It creates new value, improves skills, and is hard to replicate. Knowledge workers are losing their familiarity with deep work due to network tools. These tools, combined with easy access to them through smartphones and networked office computers, have fragmented most knowledge workers' attention. This state of fragmented attention cannot accommodate deep work, which requires long periods of uninterrupted thinking. Spending enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness can permanently reduce one's capacity to perform deep work.\n\nIndeed, the concept of deep work and its relationship to satisfaction and meaning in one's work and life is a recurring theme  in the book. The idea that cultivating focus and immersion in challenging tasks can lead to a state of flow and deep satisfaction is supported by the research of Fredrickson and Csikszentmihalyi, among others.\n\nMoreover, there is a connection between craftsmanship and this sense of sacredness and meaning in one's work. The idea that any pursuit that supports high levels of skill can generate a sense of sacredness is a powerful one, and it reminds us that the specifics of the job we choose are not necessarily what matter most for our career satisfaction.\n\nIn short, a deep life, one in which we engage in meaningful and challenging work that requires our full attention and skill, is a good life, regardless of the specifics of the work itself.\n\nThe author describes four different philosophies for incorporating deep work into one's life: the monastic philosophy, the bimodal philosophy, the rhythmic philosophy, and the journalistic philosophy. Each approach has different ways of scheduling time for deep work and achieving a state of unbroken concentration. Additionally, the author suggests creating rituals to support deep work sessions, including specific locations, time frames, and rules for working. Finally, the author emphasizes the importance of minimizing decision-making during deep work sessions to conserve willpower.\n\nThe first discipline of the Four Disciplines of Execution is to focus on the wildly important, which means identifying a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours. The second discipline is to act on lead measures, which measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures. For an individual focused on deep work, the relevant lead measure would be time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward their wildly important goal. The third discipline is to keep a compelling scoreboard to create a sense of competition and drive focus on lead measures. The fourth discipline is to create a cadence of accountability with regular and frequent meetings where team members confront their scoreboard, commit to specific actions, and describe what happened with their commitments from the last meeting.\n\nThe 4DX framework focuses on execution over strategizing and isolates a few basic disciplines that work well. Idleness is necessary for the brain like vitamin D is for the body, and it is required for deep work. To get deep work done, individuals should regularly include idleness into their day. It is important to shut down work thinking completely at the end of the workday to allow the unconscious mind to sort through the most complex professional challenges. Attention restoration theory (ART) suggests that spending time in nature can improve concentration, and individuals should avoid interrupting their evening with work-related tasks to restore their directed attention centers. \n\nDeliberate practice is the activity required to get better at something, and it overlaps substantially with deep work. To succeed with deep work, individuals should hit their daily deep work capacity during their workday and implement a strict shutdown ritual at the end of the day. Regularly resting the brain improves the quality of deep work, and the ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained. Finally, individuals must wean their minds from a dependence on distraction to deepen their focus.\n\nIn summary, to succeed in deep work and increase concentration, one should schedule time for distraction-free work, practice resistance to distractions, and use artificial deadlines to increase productivity. Additionally, productive meditation can help focus on a specific professional problem during physical activities, but one should be aware of the mind's tendency to loop over known information and distract from the task at hand.\n\nIn order to structure your deep thinking process, start by identifying the relevant variables and defining the specific next-step question. Once the next-step question is identified, focus your attention on solving it and consolidate your gains by reviewing the answer.\n\nThere are two approaches to selecting network tools: the Any-Benefit Approach and the Craftsman Approach. The Craftsman Approach requires that the positive impacts of a tool outweigh the negative impacts on factors that are important to you.\n\nThe Law of the Vital Few states that in many cases, 80% of an effect is due to just 20% of the possible causes.\n\nA strategy for limiting social media and to improve your leisure time, dedicate some advance thinking to how you want to spend it and plan out what you will do with your evenings and weekends in advance. Another strategy involves banning yourself from using all social media services for thirty days and then asking whether the last thirty days would have been better if you had used them and whether people cared that you weren't using them.\n\nThe typical person needs to learn that their mental faculties do not tire like an arm or a leg, but rather want change, not rest, except during sleep. Working a few good hours in a typical workday is lucky due to interruptions, meetings, web surfing, and personal business. \nFewer official working hours can help people spend their time more wisely. 37signals gave employees the entire month of June off for deep work, resulting in new ideas. Shallow work can be dangerous if it begins to crowd out deep efforts. Scheduling every minute of the day can increase productivity and ensure significant blocks of time for deep work or brainstorming. If an important insight arises, it's okay to abandon the schedule for the day. With structure, innovation is more likely to occur, and being willing to abandon the plan allows for creative follow-up.\n\nThis text provides several strategies to prioritize deep work over shallow work, which can be detrimental to productivity. One of the strategies is to quantify the depth of every activity and bias time towards the deeper ones. Another suggestion is to ask your boss for a shallow work budget, which is the amount of time allowed for shallow tasks. The text also suggests implementing a fixed-schedule productivity strategy, where you set a goal to finish work by a certain time and work backwards to find productivity strategies to achieve that goal. Additionally, the author recommends being cautious with saying \"yes\" to shallow work obligations and being clear in refusal but ambiguous in explanation. These strategies can help individuals focus on deep work and increase productivity.\n\nIn this section, the author discusses the problem of being constantly accessible through email and offers tips for becoming harder to reach. One strategy is to make people who email you do more work by setting up a sender filter, which requires them to answer specific questions or meet certain criteria before you'll respond. The author also suggests adopting a process-centric approach to email, which involves taking time to think through the project represented by a message and identifying the most efficient process for bringing it to a successful conclusion. Additionally, the author notes that many successful academics have a default behavior of not responding to emails unless the sender makes a convincing case and minimizes the effort required to respond. Ultimately, the author argues that a commitment to deep work requires letting go of the artificial busyness of rapid email messaging and social media posturing.\n\n## Highlights\n- Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate. (Location 32)\n- The reason knowledge workers are losing their familiarity with deep work is well established: network tools. (Location 64)\n- the rise of these tools, combined with ubiquitous access to them through smartphones and networked office computers, has fragmented most knowledge workers’ attention into slivers. (Location 66)\n- This state of fragmented attention cannot accommodate deep work, which requires long periods of uninterrupted thinking. (Location 69)\n- Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate. (Location 72)\n- In an age of network tools, in other words, knowledge workers increasingly replace deep work with the shallow alternative— constantly sending and receiving e-mail messages like human network routers, with frequent breaks for quick hits of distraction. (Location 74)\n- Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work. (Location 78)\n- Our work culture’s shift toward the shallow (whether you think it’s philosophically good or bad) is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing depth— (Location 92)\n- To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don’t cultivate this ability, you’re likely to fall behind as technology advances. (Location 148)\n- To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you’re capable of producing— a task that requires depth. (Location 154)\n- The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive. (Location 166)\n- I build my days around a core of carefully chosen deep work, with the shallow activities I absolutely cannot avoid batched into smaller bursts (Location 188)\n- Tyler Cowen summarizes this reality more bluntly: “The key question will be: are you good at working with intelligent machines or not?” (Location 252)\n- Once the talent market is made universally accessible, those at the peak of the market thrive while the rest suffer. (Location 264)\n- As digital technology reduces the need for labor in many industries, the proportion of the rewards returned to those who own the intelligent machines is growing. (Location 285)\n- In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital. (Location 293)\n- I just identified two groups that are poised to thrive and that I claim are accessible: those who can work creatively with intelligent machines and those who are stars in their field. (Location 302)\n- Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy 1. The ability to quickly master hard things. 2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed. (Location 305)\n- The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work. If you haven’t mastered this foundational skill, you’ll struggle to learn hard things or produce at an elite level. (Location 343)\n- we argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.” (Location 363)\n- deliberate practice actually requires. Its core components are usually identified as follows: (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive. (Location 371)\n- science of performance argues that you get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around the relevant neurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and effectively. To be great at something is to be well myelinated. (Location 381)\n- The reason, therefore, why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination. (Location 386)\n- If you’re comfortable going deep, you’ll be comfortable mastering the increasingly complex systems and skills needed to thrive in our economy. (Location 393)\n- High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus) (Location 426)\n- when you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn’t immediately follow— a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task. (Location 442)\n- By working on a single hard task for a long time without switching, Grant minimizes the negative impact of attention residue from his other obligations, allowing him to maximize performance on this one task. (Location 452)\n- the common habit of working in a state of semi-distraction is potentially devastating to your performance. (Location 456)\n- To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. (Location 462)\n- other ideas are being prioritized as more important than deep work in the business world, including, as we just encountered, serendipitous collaboration, rapid communication, and an active presence on social media. It’s bad enough that so many trends are prioritized ahead of deep work, but to add insult to injury, many of these trends actively decrease one’s ability to go deep. (Location 542)\n- big trends in business today actively decrease people’s ability to perform deep work, even though the benefits promised by these trends (e.g., increased serendipity, faster responses to requests, and more exposure) are arguably dwarfed by the benefits that flow from a commitment to deep work (Location 560)\n- as knowledge work makes more complex demands of the labor force, it becomes harder to measure the value of an individual’s efforts. (Location 587)\n- The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment. (Location 620)\n- a culture of connectivity makes life easier is that it creates an environment where it becomes acceptable to run your day out of your inbox— responding to the latest missive with alacrity while others pile up behind it, all the while feeling satisfyingly productive (Location 629)\n- consider the common practice of setting up regularly occurring meetings for projects. These meetings tend to pile up and fracture schedules to the point where sustained focus during the day becomes impossible. Why do they persist? They’re easier. (Location 638)\n- Instead of trying to manage their time and obligations themselves, they let the impending meeting each week force them to take some action on a given project and more generally provide a highly visible simulacrum of progress. (Location 640)\n- The Principle of Least Resistance, protected from scrutiny by the metric black hole, supports work cultures that save us from the short-term discomfort of concentration and planning, at the expense of long-term satisfaction and the production of real value. (Location 647)\n- Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not. (Location 668)\n- Busyness as Proxy for Productivity: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner. (Location 686)\n- Knowledge work is not an assembly line, and extracting value from information is an activity that’s often at odds with busyness, not supported by it. (Location 697)\n- This potent mixture of job ambiguity and lack of metrics to measure the effectiveness of different strategies allows behavior that can seem ridiculous when viewed objectively to thrive in the increasingly bewildering psychic landscape of our daily work. (Location 703)\n- Postman argued that our society was sliding into a troubling relationship with technology. We were, he noted, no longer discussing the trade-offs surrounding new technologies, balancing the new efficiencies against the new problems introduced. If it’s high-tech, we began to instead assume, then it’s good. Case closed. (Location 721)\n- In his 2013 book, To Save Everything, Click Here, Morozov attempts to pull back the curtains on our technopolic obsession with “the Internet” (Location 728)\n- the uproar, mentioned earlier, that arose when Jonathan Franzen dared suggest that novelists shouldn’t tweet. It riled people not because they’re well versed in book marketing and disagreed with Franzen’s conclusion, but because it surprised them that anyone serious would suggest the irrelevance of social media. In an Internet-centric technopoly such a statement is the equivalent of a flag burning— desecration, not debate. (Location 740)\n- Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on values like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned and nontechnological. (Location 749)\n- The myopia of your peers and employers uncovers a great personal advantage. Assuming the trends outlined here continue, depth will become increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable. (Location 763)\n- Gallagher set out to better understand the role that attention— that is, what we choose to focus on and what we choose to ignore— plays in defining the quality of our life. (Location 820)\n- the skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience. (Location 824)\n- Our brains instead construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to. If you focus on a cancer diagnosis, you and your life become unhappy and dark, but if you focus instead on an evening martini, you and your life become more pleasant— even though the circumstances in both scenarios are the same. (Location 829)\n- “Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love— is the sum of what you focus on.” (Location 831)\n- After a bad or disrupting occurrence in your life, Fredrickson’s research shows, what you choose to focus on exerts significant leverage on your attitude going forward. (Location 833)\n- a hidden but equally important benefit to cultivating rapt attention in your workday: Such concentration hijacks your attention apparatus, preventing you from noticing the many smaller and less pleasant things that unavoidably and persistently populate our lives. (Location 851)\n- ‘the idle mind is the devil’s workshop’... when you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what’s right.” A workday driven by the shallow, from a neurological perspective, is likely to be a draining and upsetting day, even if most of the shallow things that capture your attention seem harmless or fun. (Location 879)\n- In work (and especially knowledge work), to increase the time you spend in a state of depth is to leverage the complex machinery of the human brain in a way that for several different neurological reasons maximizes the meaning and satisfaction you’ll associate with your working life. (Location 882)\n- “The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.” Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state flow (a term he popularized with a 1990 book of the same title). (Location 901)\n- Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed. (Location 905)\n- Human beings, it seems, are at their best when immersed deeply in something challenging. (Location 910)\n- Gallagher’s writing emphasizes that the content of what we focus on matters. If we give rapt attention to important things, and therefore also ignore shallow negative things, we’ll experience our working life as more important and positive. (Location 912)\n- Csikszentmihalyi’s theory of flow, by contrast, is mostly agnostic to the content of our attention. Though he would likely agree with the research cited by Gallagher, his theory notes that the feeling of going deep is in itself very rewarding. Our minds like this challenge, regardless of the subject. (Location 914)\n- Deep work is an activity well suited to generate a flow state (the phrases used by Csikszentmihalyi to describe what generates flow include notions of stretching your mind to its limits, concentrating, and losing yourself in an activity— all of which also describe deep work). And as we just learned, flow generates happiness. (Location 917)\n- modern companies should embrace this reality, suggesting that “jobs should be redesigned so that they resemble as closely as possible flow activities.” Noting, however, that such a redesign would be difficult and disruptive (Location 921)\n- To build your working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction. (Location 925)\n- In 2011, Dreyfus and Kelly published a book, All Things Shining, which explores how notions of sacredness and meaning have evolved throughout the history of human culture. (Location 930)\n- Craftsmanship, Dreyfus and Kelly argue in their book’s conclusion, provides a key to reopening a sense (Location 942)\n- There’s nothing intrinsic about the manual trades when it comes to generating this particular source of meaning. Any pursuit— be it physical or cognitive— that supports high levels of skill can also generate a sense of sacredness. (Location 959)\n- The Pragmatic Programmer, a well-regarded book in the computer programming field, makes this connection between code and old-style craftsmanship more directly by quoting the medieval quarry worker’s creed in its preface: “We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.” (Location 965)\n- Our obsession with the advice to “follow your passion” (the subject of my last book), for example, is motivated by the (flawed) idea that what matters most for your career satisfaction is the specifics of the job you choose. (Location 977)\n- Throughout most of human history, to be a blacksmith or a wheelwright wasn’t glamorous. But this doesn’t matter, as the specifics of the work are irrelevant. (Location 980)\n- A deep life is a good life, any way you look at it. (Location 1000)\n- examples of deep work produced in the building. It’s meant to inspire users of the machine, creating a “culture of healthy stress and peer pressure.” (Location 1016)\n- You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. (Location 1062)\n- The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration. (Location 1066)\n- The goal is to convince you that there are many different ways to integrate deep work into your schedule, and it’s therefore worth taking the time to find an approach that makes sense for you. (Location 1092)\n- the monastic philosophy of deep work scheduling. This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations. (Location 1105)\n- the bimodal philosophy of deep work. This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically— seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. This division of time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales. (Location 1151)\n- The bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can produce extreme productivity, but only if the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavors to reach maximum cognitive intensity— the state in which real breakthroughs occur. This is why the minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day. To put aside a few hours in the morning, for example, is too short to count as a deep work stretch for an adherent of this approach. (Location 1156)\n- the rhythmic philosophy. This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit. The goal, in other words, is to generate a rhythm for this work that removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you’re going to go deep. The chain method is a good example of the rhythmic philosophy of deep work scheduling because it combines a simple scheduling heuristic (do the work every day), with an easy way to remind yourself to do the work: the big red Xs on the calendar. (Location 1188)\n- Another common way to implement the rhythmic philosophy is to replace the visual aid of the chain method with a set starting time that you use every day for deep work. In much the same way that maintaining visual indicators of your work progress can reduce the barrier to entry for going deep, eliminating even the simplest scheduling decisions, such as when during the day to do the work, also reduces this barrier. (Location 1192)\n- The rhythmic philosophy provides an interesting contrast to the bimodal philosophy. It perhaps fails to achieve the most intense levels of deep thinking sought in the daylong concentration sessions favored by the bimodalist. The trade-off, however, is that this approach works better with the reality of human nature. By supporting deep work with rock-solid routines that make sure a little bit gets done on a regular basis, the rhythmic scheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours per year. (Location 1210)\n- I call this approach, in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule, the journalist philosophy. This name is a nod to the fact that journalists, like Walter Isaacson, are trained to shift into a writing mode on a moment’s notice, as is required by the deadline-driven nature of their profession. (Location 1240)\n- This approach is not for the deep work novice. As I established in the opening to this rule, the ability to rapidly switch your mind from shallow to deep mode doesn’t come naturally. Without practice, such switches can seriously deplete your finite willpower reserves. This habit also requires a sense of confidence in your abilities— a conviction that what you’re doing is important and will succeed. (Location 1243)\n- In the final accounting, the journalistic philosophy of deep work scheduling remains difficult to pull off. But if you’re confident in the value of what you’re trying to produce, and practiced in the skill of going deep (a skill we will continue to develop in the strategies that follow), it can be a surprisingly robust way to squeeze out large amounts of depth from an otherwise demanding schedule. (Location 1260)\n- An often-overlooked observation about those who use their minds to create valuable things is that they’re rarely haphazard in their work habits. (Location 1264)\n- “[ Great creative minds] think like artists but work like accountants.” (Location 1278)\n- To make the most out of your deep work sessions, build rituals of the same level of strictness and idiosyncrasy as the important thinkers mentioned previously. (Location 1280)\n- Where you’ll work and for how long. Your ritual needs to specify a location for your deep work efforts. This location can be as simple as your normal office with the door shut and desk cleaned off (a colleague of mine likes to put a hotel-style “do not disturb” sign on his office door when he’s tackling something difficult). If it’s possible to identify a location used only for depth— for instance, a conference room or quiet library— the positive effect can be even greater. (Location 1287)\n- Regardless of where you work, be sure to also give yourself a specific time frame to keep the session a discrete challenge and not an open-ended slog. (Location 1291)\n- How you’ll work once you start to work. Your ritual needs rules and processes to keep your efforts structured. For example, you might institute a ban on any Internet use, or maintain a metric such as words produced per twenty-minute interval to keep your concentration honed. Without this structure, you’ll have to mentally litigate again and again what you should and should not be doing during these sessions and keep trying to assess whether you’re working sufficiently hard. These are unnecessary drains on your willpower reserves. (Location 1292)\n- the ritual might specify that you start with a cup of good coffee, or make sure you have access to enough food of the right type to maintain energy, or integrate light exercise such as walking to help keep the mind clear. (Location 1297)\n- a curious but effective strategy in the world of deep work: the grand gesture. The concept is simple: By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task. (Location 1319)\n- The relationship between deep work and collaboration is tricky. It’s worth taking the time to untangle, however, because properly leveraging collaboration can increase the quality of deep work in your professional life. (Location 1358)\n- This combination of soundproofed offices connected to large common areas yields a hub-and-spoke architecture of innovation in which both serendipitous encounter and isolated deep thinking are supported. It’s a setup that straddles a spectrum where on one extreme we find the solo thinker, isolated from inspiration but free from distraction, and on the other extreme, we find the fully collaborative thinker in an open office, flush with inspiration but struggling to support the deep thinking needed to build on it.* (Location 1417)\n- Expose yourself to ideas in hubs on a regular basis, but maintain a spoke in which to work deeply on what you encounter. (Location 1427)\n- the whiteboard effect. For some types of problems, working with someone else at the proverbial shared whiteboard can push you deeper than if you were working alone. The presence of the other party waiting for your next insight— be it someone physically in the same room or collaborating with you virtually— can short-circuit the natural instinct to avoid depth. (Location 1440)\n- when pursuing innovation— collaborative deep work can yield better results. This strategy, therefore, asks that you consider this option in contemplating how best to integrate depth into your professional life. (Location 1445)\n- First, distraction remains a destroyer of depth. Therefore, the hub-and-spoke model provides a crucial template. Separate your pursuit of serendipitous encounters from your efforts to think deeply and build on these inspirations. You should try to optimize each effort separately, as opposed to mixing them together into a sludge that impedes both goals. (Location 1447)\n- Second, even when you retreat to a spoke to think deeply, when it’s reasonable to leverage the whiteboard effect, do so. By working side by side with someone on a problem, you can push each other toward deeper levels of depth, and therefore toward the generation of more and more valuable output as compared to working alone. (Location 1449)\n- this division between what and how is crucial but is overlooked in the professional world. It’s often straightforward to identify a strategy needed to achieve a goal, but what trips up companies is figuring out how to execute the strategy once identified. (Location 1465)\n- Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important (Location 1477)\n- “The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish.” (Location 1478)\n- execution should be aimed at a small number of “wildly important goals.” (Location 1478)\n- For an individual focused on deep work, the implication is that you should identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours. (Location 1480)\n- “If you want to win the war for attention, don’t try to say ‘no’ to the trivial distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say ‘yes’ to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else.” (Location 1483)\n- Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures (Location 1488)\n- Once you’ve identified a wildly important goal, you need to measure your success. In 4DX, there are two types of metrics for this purpose: lag measures and lead measures. Lag measures describe the thing you’re ultimately trying to improve. (Location 1489)\n- the problem with lag measures is that they come too late to change your behavior: “When you receive them, the performance that drove them is already in the past.” (Location 1492)\n- Lead measures, on the other hand, “measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.” (Location 1493)\n- In other words, lead measures turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control in the near future that will then have a positive impact on your long-term goals. (Location 1496)\n- For an individual focused on deep work, it’s easy to identify the relevant lead measure: time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal. (Location 1497)\n- When I shifted to tracking deep work hours, suddenly these measures became relevant to my day-to-day: Every hour extra of deep work was immediately reflected in my tally. (Location 1501)\n- Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard (Location 1502)\n- when attempting to drive your team’s engagement toward your organization’s wildly important goal, it’s important that they have a public place to record and track their lead measures. This scoreboard creates a sense of competition that drives them to focus on these measures, even when other demands vie for their attention. (Location 1504)\n- Discipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability (Location 1517)\n- the final step to help maintain a focus on lead measures is to put in place “a rhythm of regular and frequent meetings of any team that owns a wildly important goal.” (Location 1518)\n- During these meetings, the team members must confront their scoreboard, commit to specific actions to help improve the score before the next meeting, and describe what happened with the commitments they made at the last meeting. (Location 1519)\n- The 4DX framework is based on the fundamental premise that execution is more difficult than strategizing. After hundreds and hundreds of case studies, its inventors managed to isolate a few basic disciplines that seem to work particularly (Location 1528)\n- Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets... it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done. (Location 1550)\n- you should follow Kreider’s lead by injecting regular and substantial freedom from professional concerns into your day, providing you with the idleness paradoxically required to get (deep) work done. (Location 1555)\n- At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues until the next morning— no after-dinner e-mail check, no mental replays of conversations, and no scheming about how you’ll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely. (Location 1558)\n- unconscious thought theory (UTT)— an attempt to understand the different roles conscious and unconscious deliberation play in decision making. At a high level, this theory proposes that for decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind must be involved. (Location 1575)\n- UTT hypothesizes that this is due to the fact that these regions of your brain have more neuronal bandwidth available, allowing them to move around more information and sift through more potential solutions than your conscious centers of thinking. Your conscious mind, according to this theory, is like a home computer on which you can run carefully written programs that return correct answers to limited problems, whereas your unconscious mind is like Google’s vast data centers, in which statistical algorithms sift through terabytes of unstructured information, teasing out surprising useful solutions to difficult questions. (Location 1579)\n- providing your conscious brain time to rest enables your unconscious mind to take a shift sorting through your most complex professional challenges. A shutdown habit, therefore, is not necessarily reducing the amount of time you’re engaged in productive work, but is instead diversifying the type of work you deploy. (Location 1584)\n- attention restoration theory (ART), which claims that spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate. (Location 1593)\n- To concentrate requires what ART calls directed attention. This resource is finite: If you exhaust it, you’ll struggle to concentrate. (Location 1596)\n- Put another way, when walking through nature, you’re freed from having to direct your attention, as there are few challenges to navigate (like crowded street crossings), and experience enough interesting stimuli to keep your mind sufficiently occupied to avoid the need to actively aim your attention. (Location 1603)\n- the implications of ART expand beyond the benefits of nature. The core mechanism of this theory is the idea that you can restore your ability to direct your attention if you give this activity a rest. (Location 1610)\n- if you keep interrupting your evening to check and respond to e-mail, or put aside a few hours after dinner to catch up on an approaching deadline, you’re robbing your directed attention centers of the uninterrupted rest they need for restoration. Even if these work dashes consume only a small amount of time, they prevent you from reaching the levels of deeper relaxation in which attention restoration can occur. (Location 1615)\n- trying to squeeze a little more work out of your evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that you end up getting less done than if you had instead respected a shutdown. (Location 1619)\n- deliberate practice is the systematic stretching of your ability for a given skill. It is the activity required to get better at something. Deep work and deliberate practice, as I’ve argued, overlap substantially. (Location 1623)\n- The implication of these results is that your capacity for deep work in a given day is limited. If you’re careful about your schedule (using, for example, the type of productivity strategies described in Rule #4), you should hit your daily deep work capacity during your workday. (Location 1631)\n- To succeed with this strategy, you must first accept the commitment that once your workday shuts down, you cannot allow even the smallest incursion of professional concerns into your field of attention. This includes, crucially, checking e-mail, as well as browsing work-related websites. (Location 1638)\n- to support your commitment to shutting down with a strict shutdown ritual that you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed. In more detail, this ritual should ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed that either (1) you have a plan you trust for its completion, or (2) it’s captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right. (Location 1643)\n- the Zeigarnik effect. This effect, which is named for the experimental work of the early-twentieth-century psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, describes the ability of incomplete tasks to dominate our attention. (Location 1657)\n- “Committing to a specific plan for a goal may therefore not only facilitate attainment of the goal but may also free cognitive resources for other pursuits.” (Location 1668)\n- Shutdown rituals can become annoying, as they add an extra ten to fifteen minutes to the end of your workday (and sometimes even more), but they’re necessary for reaping the rewards of systematic idleness summarized previously. (Location 1673)\n- regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work. When you work, work hard. When you’re done, be done. (Location 1678)\n- The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained. (Location 1706)\n- it’s common to treat undistracted concentration as a habit like flossing— something that you know how to do and know is good for you, but that you’ve (Location 1707)\n- Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don’t simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction. (Location 1713)\n- People who multitask all the time can’t filter out irrelevancy. They can’t manage a working memory. They’re chronically distracted. They initiate much larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand... they’re pretty much mental wrecks. (Location 1719)\n- If every moment of potential boredom in your life— say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives— is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research, it’s not ready for deep work— even (Location 1727)\n- Don’t Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus. (Location 1737)\n- Internet Sabbath cannot by itself cure a distracted brain. If you eat healthy just one day a week, you’re unlikely to lose weight, as the majority of your time is still spent gorging. Similarly, if you spend just one day a week resisting distraction, you’re unlikely to diminish your brain’s craving for these stimuli, as most of your time is still spent giving in to it. (Location 1750)\n- Instead of scheduling the occasional break from distraction so you can focus, you should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction. (Location 1753)\n- Schedule in advance when you’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times. I suggest that you keep a notepad near your computer at work. On this pad, record the next time you’re allowed to use the Internet. Until you arrive at that time, absolutely no network connectivity is allowed— no matter how tempting. (Location 1758)\n- It’s instead the constant switching from low-stimuli/ high-value activities to high-stimuli/ low-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty. (Location 1761)\n- if you’ve scheduled your next Internet block thirty minutes from the current moment, and you’re beginning to feel bored and crave distraction, the next thirty minutes of resistance become a session of concentration calisthenics. A full day of scheduled distraction therefore becomes a full day of similar mental training. (Location 1766)\n- To simply wait and be bored has become a novel experience in modern life, but from the perspective of concentration training, it’s incredibly valuable. (Location 1805)\n- to succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli. This doesn’t mean that you have to eliminate distracting behaviors; it’s sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention. (Location 1807)\n- identify a deep task (that is, something that requires deep work to complete) that’s high on your priority list. Estimate how long you’d normally put aside for an obligation of this type, then give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces this time. If possible, commit publicly to the deadline— (Location 1831)\n- Deep work requires levels of concentration well beyond where most knowledge workers are comfortable. Roosevelt dashes leverage artificial deadlines to help you systematically increase the level you can regularly achieve— providing, in some sense, interval training for the attention centers of your brain. An additional benefit is that these dashes are incompatible with distraction (Location 1841)\n- The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you’re occupied physically but not mentally— walking, jogging, driving, showering— and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem. Depending on your profession, this problem might be outlining an article, writing a talk, making progress on a proof, or attempting to sharpen a business strategy. As in mindfulness meditation, you must continue to bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls. (Location 1859)\n- As a novice, when you begin a productive meditation session, your mind’s first act of rebellion will be to offer unrelated but seemingly more interesting thoughts. (Location 1879)\n- looping. When faced with a hard problem, your mind, as it was evolved to do, will attempt to avoid excess expenditure of energy when possible. One way it might attempt to sidestep this expenditure is by avoiding diving deeper into the problem by instead looping over and over again on what you already know about (Location 1884)\n- Structure Your Deep Thinking (Location 1890)\n- structure for this deep thinking process. I suggest starting with a careful review of the relevant variables for solving the problem and then storing these values in your working memory. (Location 1892)\n- Once the relevant variables are identified, define the specific next-step question you need to answer using these variables. (Location 1895)\n- With the relevant variables stored and the next-step question identified, you now have a specific target for your attention. Assuming you’re able to solve your next-step question, the final step of this structured approach to deep thinking is to consolidate your gains by reviewing clearly the answer you identified. (Location 1897)\n- A side effect of memory training, in other words, is an improvement in your general ability to concentrate. This ability can then be fruitfully applied to any task demanding deep work. (Location 1921)\n- The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection: You’re justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, or anything you might possibly miss out on if you don’t use it. (Location 2030)\n- The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts. (Location 2085)\n- Whereas the any-benefit mind-set identifies any potential positive impact as justification for using a tool, the craftsman variant requires that these positive impacts affect factors at the core of what’s important to you and that they outweigh the negatives. (Location 2087)\n- Of course Facebook offers benefits to your social life, but none are important enough to what really matters to you in this area to justify giving it access to your time and attention.* (Location 2180)\n- The Law of the Vital Few*: In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes. (Location 2195)\n- (an 80/ 20 split is roughly what you would expect when describing a power law distribution over impact— a type of distribution that shows up often when measuring quantities in the real world), but it’s probably most useful when applied heuristically as a reminder that, in many cases, contributions to an outcome are not evenly distributed. (Location 2199)\n- this strategy asks that you perform the equivalent of a packing party on the social media services that you currently use. Instead of “packing,” however, you’ll instead ban yourself from using them for thirty days. All of them: Facebook, Instagram, Google +, Twitter, Snapchat, Vine— or (Location 2238)\n- After thirty days of this self-imposed network isolation, ask yourself the following two questions about each of the services you temporarily quit: 1. Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service? 2. Did people care that I wasn’t using this service? (Location 2243)\n- For most people and most services, the news might be sobering— no one outside your closest friends and family will likely even notice you’ve signed off. (Location 2280)\n- The “great and profound mistake which my typical man makes in regard to his day,” he elaborates, is that even though he doesn’t particularly enjoy his work (seeing it as something to “get through”), “he persists in looking upon those hours from ten to six as ‘the day,’ to which the ten hours preceding them and the six hours following them are nothing but a prologue and epilogue.” This is an attitude that Bennett condemns as “utterly illogical and unhealthy.” (Location 2300)\n- with the rise of the Internet and the low-brow attention economy it supports, the average forty-hour-a-week employee— especially those in my tech-savvy Millennial generation— has seen the quality of his or her leisure time remain degraded, consisting primarily of a blur of distracted clicks on least-common-denominator digital entertainment. If Bennett were brought back to life today, he’d likely fall into despair at the lack of progress in this area of human development. (Location 2309)\n- you both should and can make deliberate use of your time outside work, remains relevant today— especially (Location 2314)\n- such behavior is dangerous, as it weakens your mind’s general ability to resist distraction, making deep work difficult later when you really want to concentrate. (Location 2327)\n- Arnold Bennett identified the solution to this problem a hundred years earlier: Put more thought into your leisure time. In other words, this strategy suggests that when it comes to your relaxation, don’t default to whatever catches your attention at the moment, but instead dedicate some advance thinking to the question of how you want to spend your “day within a day.” (Location 2330)\n- figure out in advance what you’re going to do with your evenings and weekends before they begin. (Location 2335)\n- One of the chief things which my typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change— not rest, except in sleep. (Location 2346)\n- If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughout all your waking hours, you’ll end the day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed, than if you instead allow your mind to bathe for hours in semiconscious and unstructured Web surfing. (Location 2348)\n- Drain the Shallows (Location 2355)\n- Very few people work even 8 hours a day. You’re lucky if you get a few good hours in between all the meetings, interruptions, web surfing, office politics, and personal business that permeate the typical workday. (Location 2369)\n- Fewer official working hours helps squeeze the fat out of the typical workweek. Once everyone has less time to get their stuff done, they respect that time even more. People become stingy with their time and that’s a good thing. They don’t waste it on things that just don’t matter. When you have fewer hours you usually spend them more wisely. (Location 2371)\n- 37signals implemented something radical: The company gave its employees the entire month of June off to work deeply on their own projects. This month would be a period free of any shallow work obligations— no status meetings, no memos, and, blessedly, no PowerPoint. At the end of the month, the company held a “pitch day” (Location 2383)\n- “How can we afford to put our business on hold for a month to ‘mess around’ with new ideas?” Fried asked rhetorically. “How can we afford not to?” (Location 2390)\n- Deep work is exhausting because it pushes you toward the limit of your abilities. (Location 2403)\n- The implication is that once you’ve hit your deep work limit in a given day, you’ll experience diminishing rewards if you try to cram in more. Shallow work, therefore, doesn’t become dangerous until after you add enough to begin to crowd out your bounded deep efforts for the day. At first, this caveat might seem optimistic. (Location 2407)\n- to treat shallow work with suspicion because its damage is often vastly underestimated and its importance vastly overestimated. (Location 2420)\n- Schedule Every Minute of Your Day (Location 2423)\n- Schedule every minute of your day. Here’s my suggestion: At the beginning of each workday, turn to a new page of lined paper in a notebook you dedicate to this purpose. Down the left-hand side of the page, mark every other line with an hour of the day, covering the full set of hours you typically work. Now comes the important part: Divide the hours of your workday into blocks and assign activities to the blocks. (Location 2440)\n- There might be time blocks for lunch or relaxation breaks. To keep things reasonably clean, the minimum length of a block should be thirty minutes (i.e., one line on your page). This means, for example, that instead of having a unique small box for each small task on your plate for the day— respond to boss’s e-mail, submit reimbursement form, ask Carl about report— you can batch similar things into more generic task blocks. You might find it useful, in this case, to draw a line from a task block to the open right-hand side of the page where you can list out the full set of small tasks you plan to accomplish in that block. (Location 2446)\n- Cross out the blocks for the remainder of the day and create new blocks to the right of the old ones on the page (I draw my blocks skinny so I have room for several revisions). On some days, you might rewrite your schedule half a dozen times. Don’t despair if this happens. (Location 2457)\n- In my own daily scheduling discipline, in addition to regularly scheduling significant blocks of time for speculative thinking and discussion, I maintain a rule that if I stumble onto an important insight, then this is a perfectly valid reason to ignore the rest of my schedule for the day (Location 2480)\n- With structure, on the other hand, you can ensure that you regularly schedule blocks to grapple with a new idea, or work deeply on something challenging, or brainstorm for a fixed period— the type of commitment more likely to instigate innovation. (Recall, for example, the discussion in Rule #1 about the rigid rituals followed by many great creative thinkers.) And because you’re willing to abandon your plan when an innovative idea arises, you’re just as well suited as the distracted creative to follow up when the muse strikes. (Location 2491)\n- Quantify the Depth of Every Activity (Location 2500)\n- An advantage of scheduling your day is that you can determine how much time you’re actually spending in shallow activities. (Location 2500)\n- planning meeting— probably not. Such meetings rarely dive into substantive content and tend to feature a lot of small talk and posturing in which participants try to make it seem like they’re committing to a lot without actually having to commit. (Location 2534)\n- Once you know where your activities fall on the deep-to-shallow scale, bias your time toward the former. (Location 2543)\n- Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget (Location 2548)\n- What percentage of my time should be spent on shallow work? This strategy suggests that you ask it. If you have a boss, in other words, have a conversation about this question. (Location 2549)\n- non-entry-level knowledge work jobs, the answer to the question will be somewhere in the 30 to 50 percent range (there’s a psychological distaste surrounding the idea of spending the majority of your time on unskilled tasks, so 50 percent is a natural upper limit, (Location 2553)\n- drop the need for a weekly status meeting in preference for results-driven reporting (“ let me know when you’ve made significant progress; then we’ll talk”). (Location 2559)\n- part of the reason shallow work persists in large quantities in knowledge work is that we rarely see the total impact of such efforts on our schedules. (Location 2568)\n- You can now confidently say to your boss, “This is the exact percentage of my time spent last week on shallow work,” and force him or her to give explicit approval for that ratio. (Location 2570)\n- (it’s incredibly wasteful, for example, to pay a highly trained professional to send e-mail messages and attend meetings for thirty hours a week), (Location 2572)\n- By instead picking and sticking with a shallow-to-deep ratio, you can replace this guilt-driven unconditional acceptance with the more healthy habit of trying to get the most out of the time you put aside for shallow work (therefore still exposing yourself to many opportunities), but keeping these efforts constrained to a small enough fraction of your time and attention to enable the deep work that ultimately drives your business forward. (Location 2580)\n- Finish Your Work by Five Thirty (Location 2590)\n- fixed-schedule productivity, as I fix the firm goal of not working past a certain time, then work backward to find productivity strategies that allow me to satisfy this declaration. (Location 2594)\n- Nagpal opens the article by claiming that much of the stress suffered by tenure-track professors is self-imposed. (Location 2611)\n- According to her article, one of the main techniques for respecting her hour limit was to set drastic quotas on the major sources of shallow endeavors in her academic life. (Location 2621)\n- she decided she would travel only five times per year for any purpose, as trips can generate a surprisingly large load of urgent shallow obligations (Location 2622)\n- The travel quota is just one of several tactics that Nagpal used to control her workday (she also, for example, placed limits on the number of papers she would review per year), but what all her tactics shared was a commitment to ruthlessly capping the shallow while protecting the deep efforts— that is, original research— that ultimately determined her professional fate. (Location 2626)\n- I, too, am incredibly cautious about my use of the most dangerous word in one’s productivity vocabulary: “yes.” It takes a lot to convince me to agree to something that yields shallow work. (Location 2630)\n- Another tactic that works well for me is to be clear in my refusal but ambiguous in my explanation for the refusal. The key is to avoid providing enough specificity about the excuse that the requester has the opportunity to defuse it. (Location 2632)\n- I don’t provide details— which might leave the requester the ability to suggest a way to fit his or her event into my existing obligations— but instead just say, “Sounds interesting, but I can’t make it due to schedule conflicts.” In turning down obligations, I also resist the urge to offer a consolation prize that ends up devouring almost as much of my schedule (Location 2635)\n- the reduction in shallow frees up more energy for the deep alternative, allowing us to produce more than if we had defaulted to a more typical crowded schedule.

(Location 2687)\n- The default social convention surrounding e-mail is that unless you’re famous, if someone sends you something, you owe him or her a response. For most, therefore, an inbox full of messages generates a major sense of obligation. (Location 2691)\n- By instead resetting your correspondents’ expectations to the reality that you’ll probably not respond, the experience is transformed. The inbox is now a collection of opportunities that you can glance at when you have the free time— seeking out those that make sense for you to engage. But the pile of unread messages no longer generates a sense of obligation.

For those who make it past this step, Herbert enforces a small fee you must pay before communicating with him. (Location 2711)\n- consider Antonio Centeno, who runs the popular Real Man Style blog. Centeno’s sender filter lays out a two-step process. If you have a question, he diverts you to a public location to post it. Centeno thinks it’s wasteful to answer the same questions again and again in private one-on-one conversations. If you make it past this step, he then makes you commit to, by clicking check boxes, the following three promises: I am not asking Antonio a style question I could find searching Google for 10 minutes. I am not SPAMMING Antonio with a cut-and-pasting generic request to promote my unrelated business. I will do a good deed for some random stranger if Antonio responds within 23 hours. (Location 2716)\n- To summarize, the technologies underlying e-mail are transformative, but the current social conventions guiding how we apply this technology are underdeveloped. (Location 2723)\n- The sender filter is a small but useful step toward a better state of affairs, and is an idea whose time has come— at least for the increasing number of entrepreneurs and freelancers who both receive a lot of incoming communication and have the ability to dictate their accessibility. (Location 2726)\n- interrogative e-mails like these generate an initial instinct to dash off the quickest possible response that will clear the message— temporarily— out of your inbox. A quick response will, in the short term, provide you with some minor relief because you’re bouncing the responsibility implied by the message off your court and back onto the sender’s. This relief, however, is short-lived, as this responsibility will continue to bounce back again and again, continually sapping your time and attention. (Location 2738)\n- the right strategy when faced with a question of this type is to pause a moment before replying and take the time to answer the following key prompt: What is the project represented by this message, and what is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this project to a successful conclusion? (Location 2742)\n- Process-Centric Response to E-mail (Location 2759)\n- Less mental clutter means more mental resources available for deep thinking. (Location 2777)\n- Process-centric e-mails might not seem natural at first. For one thing, they require that you spend more time thinking about your messages before you compose them. In the moment, this might seem like you’re spending more time on e-mail. But the important point to remember is that the extra two to three minutes you spend at this point will save you many more minutes reading and responding to unnecessary extra messages later. (Location 2778)\n- famous academics. In doing so, I noticed that many shared a fascinating and somewhat rare approach to e-mail: Their default behavior when receiving an e-mail message is to not respond. (Location 2788)\n- When it comes to e-mail, they believed, it’s the sender’s responsibility to convince the receiver that a reply is worthwhile. If you didn’t make a convincing case and sufficiently minimize the effort required by the professor to respond, you didn’t get a response. (Location 2790)\n- Professorial E-mail Sorting: Do not reply to an e-mail message if any of the following applies:• It’s ambiguous or otherwise makes it hard for you to generate a reasonable response.• It’s not a question or proposal that interests you.• Nothing really good would happen if you did respond and nothing really bad would happen if you didn’t. (Location 2802)\n- “Develop the habit of letting small bad things happen. If you don’t, you’ll never find time for the life-changing big things.” (Location 2812)\n- A commitment to deep work is not a moral stance and it’s not a philosophical statement— it is instead a pragmatic recognition that the ability to concentrate is a skill that gets valuable things done.

The core of strategic work is discovering critical factors in a situation and designing a way to coordinate actions to deal with those factors.\n\nA good strategy identifies the greatest challenges and includes a set of coherent actions to overcome them.\n\nStrategy is usually used a synonym of ambition, success or innovation. \n\nLogical structure of strategy (the kernel):\n- Diagnosis: Identifies obstacles\n- Guiding policy: Approach to deal with obstacles\n- Coherent action: Coordinated policies, resource commitments, and actions to carry out the guiding policy.\n\nGood strategy is not goal setting, but problem solving.\n\nGood strategy involves applying strengths (resources) to obtain advantages in the most promising opportunities. \nNatural sources of strength:\n- Coherent strategy: creates strength through the coherence of is design, the coordination of policies and actions.\n- Subtle shifts of viewpoint. A reframing of competitive situation can create advantage and weaknesses.\n\n# Part I Good and bad strategy \n# 1. Good strategy is unexpected\n\nMost companies don't have good strategy so having one is a source of natural advantage. The don't expect you to have a coherent strategy that involves resources, coordinated actions, policies and resources to overcome an important obstacle.\n\n## Apple\nTwo months away from bankruptcy, Jobs rejoined Apple. He cut Apple to the core, from 15 Desktop models to 1, killed printers and peripherals, emulated Dells supply chain in Asia and brought operating system from Next.\n\nHis next strategy was to wait for the next big thing (window of opportunity). This is not a recipe for success\n\n## Desert storm\nLeft hook maneuver to attack Irak. It was military strategy 101, butgood strategy is unexpected.\n\n`` Coordinating and focusing resources is important instead of dedicating them to unconnected targets ``\n\n# 2. Discovering power\nViewing things from fresh perspective uncovers strengths advantages threats and weaknesses.\n\nDavid and Goliath story shows that apparent weaknesses and apparent strength can be overcome.\n\n## Walmart \n\nCase study that helps uncover hidden power in situations. Conventional wisdom said that \"A full line discount store nerds a population vase of at least 100k\".\n\nIn a strategy exercise you should consider the competition even when it is not at the core of the exercise.\n\nIn this case the tipping point is that the operating unit is not the store but a network of stores.\n\n## Cold war strategy \n\nUs advantage was technology but the strategy was to to engage in developments  that imposed exorbitant costs in USSR, by focusing in areas that were expensive to counter.\n\n\u003e Use your relative advantages to impose out of proportion costs on the opposition and complicate his problem of competing with you \n\nThis is the discovery of the Hidden power in the situation.\n\n# Bad strategy \nIt is not the absence of good strategy it is the result of dysfunctional leadership and specific misconceptions\n- Fluff: inflated words to create the illusion of high level thinking\n- Failure to face the challenge fails to recognise the challenge\n- Mistaking goals for strategy. Statements of desire instead of plans to face the obstacles \n- bad strategic objectives: when fail to address critical issues or impracticable \n\n\u003e bad strategy is long on goals and short on policy and action\n\n## Fluff \nBuzzwords combined with superficial and obvious statements.\n\n## Failure to face the problem \n\nA strategy must define a challenge problem or obstacle and state a response or approach to overcome it.\n\n## Mistaking goals for strategy \n\nFind the most promising opportunities for the business looking at who your buyers are, who you compete with and what opportunities exist. Then build a strategy that channels your energy to one or two of the most attractive opportunities.\n\nPerformance goals or rolling budgets are not strategies \n\n## bad strategic objectives \n\nA general manager or CEO decides the general strategic objectives and subgoals for each part of the organisation.\n\nA leader uses strategy to bridge the path between overall goals and actionable specific objectives.\n\nA long list of objectives is not a strategy. A good strategy focuses energy and resources on very few pivotal objectives.\n\nAnother form of bad strategic objectives is to pursue unattainable objectives no one knows how to tackle with current resources and skills.\n\n`When a leader characterizes the challenge as underperformance, it set the stage for bad strategy. Underperformance is a result. The true challenges are the reasons of underperformance.`\n\n# Why so much bad strategy?\nBad strategy is the result of:\n- Unwillingness to choose: avoidance of taking decisions facing opportunity costs. Strategy requires focus and setting aside some goals. Universal buy-in might indicate the absence of choice. In organisations the older the inertia the larger resistance to change. See Arrow decision theory and Condorcet's paradox\n- Template style strategy. Max Weber's charismatic Vs formal leaders. Peter Drucker did not agree on the need of charisma to be an effective leader. Charismatic, transformational leadership has led to Template style strategic planning which usually involves things like vision, mission, values. This frees people to think on the true challenges they are trying to csolve.\n- Positive thinking displaces critical thinking and good strategy\n\n# The kernel of good strategy \nElements\n- Diagnosis: Describes the challenge. Answers the question \"What is it going on here?\". So diagnosis is a judgement of facts, a simplified model that allows us to tackle complexity and advance in problem solving. This model focuses in factor that can be addressed with policy. **It is the why.\n- Guiding policy: Overall approach to face the challenge. Provides direction without explicitly defining what to do. Many people call strategy to guiding policy, but stating a diagnosis you can find alternative guiding policies. A good guiding policy tackles the challenge in the diagnosis by leveraging sources of advantage. It can be in itself an advantage, for instance by reducing the uncertainty of what to do, how to compete how to organise. It also helps focusing resources on specific set of challenge. **It is the what.\n- A set of coherent actions that carry out the guiding policy in a coordinated way. Strategy must decide priorities, and a great way to sharpen strategy is the necessity to act. We always hope that with a great design we can accomplish several conflicting objectives but the truth is that we need strategy to choose what to do and what to abandon. The coordination and coherence of action acts as a prominent source of advantage.  Coherence imposed by a system by design, not adhoc, the kind of unnatural coordination that would not exists if it weren't without strategy. Centralization has many caveats (coordination interrupts and de specialized people, among others) but some benefits only appear if decisions are properly coordinated.  **It is the how.\n\n\n## Part II Sources of power \n\n# Using leverage \nConcentrate force, focus, energy and minds in pivotal objectives.\n\n- Anticipation of market demand and competitors behaviour and reactions.\n- Pivotal objectives magnify the effects of focused energy and resources.\n- Concentration means that sometime focusing on a limited number of objectives you reach a threshold level (a critical level of effort necessary to affect the system). It is also wise to increase perceived effectiveness by concentrating on targets that catch attention.\n\n# Proximate objectives \nCreate feasible objectives with the skills and resources at hand. Sending man to the moon Vs the war on drugs.\n\n- Solving  ambiguity. Proximate objectives does wonders to organizational energy and focus. Challenges usually appear impossible because of complexity and uncertainty. A good leader can pass the organisation a simpler and solvable problem.\n- Taking a strong position and creating options. The more dynamic the situation the poorer your forecast. In uncertain scenarios make moves that improve your position and create opportunity. \n- Hierarchies of objectives. Your goal when you know how to crawl, must be to learn to walk. Once you learn to walk you can aim at running. \n\n# Chain-link systems \nChain link systems are those limited by its weakest link. Once there exists a weak link ain't no point in strengthening the rest of the system. \n\n- Getting stuck. Higher quality in a link that is not matched with higher quality in other links may cause worse results. \n- Getting unstuck. Quality matching in chain link systems requires working without inmediate returns. \n- Excellence. A well designed chain linked system is really difficult to replicate. For instance many IKEA policies are different from the norm (traditional furniture retailers does no carry large inventories, normal retailers don't do own designs or use catalogs instead of sales people) and work coherently in a chain like logic.\n![[IMG_20220705_232755.jpg]]\n\n# Using design \nWe can learn from military strategy the importance of design:\n- Premeditation. Prior guidance with design and planning in advance.\n- Anticipation. Of the thoughts and behaviours by others.\n- Design of coordinated action. Choreography of a designed plan. Strategists are designers working to solve a problem not decision makers that choose among different options that are presented to them. \n\nDesign must find sweet spots which must balance with coordination among activities to make the whole strategy effective. Each part of the system must be reconsidered to the needs of the rest of the system. This means that design has to optimise performance while keeping in mind tradeoffs between capabilities and tight integration. The greater the challenge the greater need of resources or the greater the need for coherent, integrated, design-type strategy. Resources and integration are partial substitutes of each other. Integration costs are related to the difficulty to create tight integrations, narrower focus, more fragile and less responsiveness to change..\n\nPotent resource position can eventually lead to produce profit without great effort.\n\n\u003e Easy life breed laxity: success leads to laxity that leads to decline \n\nCurrent profit is usually thought to be the result of current actions but it may be the harvest of planting seasons long past.\n\nThe challenger usually faces the incumbent by leveraging a tight design -type strategy. \n\n\u003e Most incumbent will loosen their tight integration and begin to rely more on accumulated resources and less on clever design. They will lose the discipline of tight integration, allowing independent fiefdoms to flourish and adding so many products and projects that integration becomes impossible. Faced with the natural slowing of growth over time, they will try to create the appearance of youthful vigor with bolt-on acquisitions. Then, when their resource base eventually becomes obsolete, they, too, will become prey to another generation of upstarts. It is the cycle of life.\n\n# Focus\nIn order to identify a company's strategy byou have to do your own analysis you cannot fully buy what HBR is telling. \n\nTo begin you usually start by examining the competitive environment.\n\nThen look at each policy of the company and notice those that are different from the norm in the industry. We then try to distinguish the target they are trying to accomplish.\n\n![[IMG_20220708_091247.jpg]]\n\nFocus is the coordination of policies that produces extra power by interacting and overlapping effects. It denotes the application of that extra power to the right target.\n\nReal world has an inner logic that is no secret but usually is under the radar. To spot the real strategy you must work hard analysing qualitative information.\nTruth is that not all companies have a strategy. Strategy requires focus and many large companies pursue multiple goals at once without taking the max out of them.\n\n# Growth \nGrowth by acquisition to ramp up KPIs without thoughtful strategy eventually leads to worse performance. Moreover when you buy a company, specially a public one you pay way too much. \n\nHealthy growth it is the outcome of growing demand for special capabilities. It is the outcome of better products and services. The correct innovation processes usually leads to higher market share and a superior rate of profit.\n\n# Using advantage \nAdvantage results from asymmetries from competition. No company or organisation can have advantages at everything. You must exploit where you have advantages and avoid situations you are weak.\n\nYou might be great at running 1500 meters, and you can do a good job running 10k, but probably you cannot wrestle a gorilla.\n\nPorter's competitive advantage is either lower costs than your competitors, or greater perceived value for your customers or a combination of the two. \n\nSustainable competitive advantage requires that competitors cannot duplicate it. Isolating mechanisms are patents, reputation, network effects, huge economies of scale...\n\nCompetitive advantage is interesting when it can be updated, engineered and improved.\n\nWealth increases when competitive advantage increases and for that you need:\n- Deepening advantages. This could be achieved by cutting costs via improving processes a la Taylor or by increasing value by improving products via product development. \n- Broadening the extent of advantages by applying them to new markets. Extending a competitive advantage requires building on your strengths. Extensions based on proprietary know how might even enhance knowledge. Extensions based on brand reputation are risky because they can damage the core. For instance, pirates of Caribbean extend Disney brand to adventure movies. \n- Creating higher demand for advantaged products or services. That higher demand might be because we add more users or because each buyer demands more. The process of engineering higher demand \n- Block easy replication by competitors. The value of your business can be increased by reducing the risk of imitative competition. Patents, copyrights and brand recognition are entry barriers. Also creating a moving target, a product that is constantly evolving (not saying improving, just moving) makes it more difficult to be imitated.\n\n\n# Using dynamics\n\nDramatical technical inventions and business model innovations create competitive advantages.\n\nAnother way is to exploit exogenous changes such as technology shifts, competition, politics and buyer perceptions. These changes might erode old advantages weakening existing leaders or enabling new ones.\n\nThe role of a leader is to ride waves of change and ensure the resources and innovation are channeled toward positions that will become advantages.\n\nThe importance is not in forecasting but in understanding past and present and to be able to take advantage of a wave of change. For instance, the basis of success lately is related to software written by small teams.\n\nIn order to really challenge the experts you need to deep dive into the details and understand the fundamentals. \n\nIn order to ride the waves of change you do not need to understand them completely right, just to do it better than your competitors.\n\nWays to understand industry transitions:\n- Rising fixed costs: Growing fixed costs forces the industry to consolidate. \n- Deregulation: Changes in the rules that govern a market cause heavy modifications in the competitive landscape. Deregulated players and former monopolists are myopic of their actual costs so they might chase for years unprofitable market segments once the subsidies are gone.\n- Predictable biases: People usually do not see that surges in demand peak and the decline to normal levels. \n- Incumbent response: incumbents resist change and transition.\n- Attractor states: Potential efficient equilibrium that might be reach by the market.\n\n# Inertia and entropy\n\nInertia is the inability to adapt to changing circumstances. Understanding the inertia of rival can create windows of opportunity to win a market.\n\n- Inertia of routine. Standard routines define how an organisation process information and deal with change. You can overcome obsolete routines by hiring managers with better methods, or redesigning processes.a\n- Cultural inertia. Simplification helps breaking organizational culture inertia. \n- Inertia by proxy. Inertia created by old streams of profit when customers are too slow to replace products despite relative price or quality differences. \n\n\nEntropy affects weekly managed organizations that tends to become less organised and focused.\n\nOrganizational renewal helps reducing risks associated to inertia and entropy.\n\n\n# The science of strategy\n\nA new strategy is a hypothesis and it's implementation, an experiment.\n\nFunctional knowledge is created by experimenting with different strategies.\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.494115022Z","tags":null},"/literature-notes/Books/How-to-Fail-at-Almost-Everything-and-Still-Win-Big":{"title":"How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big","content":"\n```\nIn order to succeed manage your energy by eating and doing exercise, hack your brains by daydreaming and embrace failure. \n```\n\n***\n**Author**:  [Scott Adams]\n***\n\n# Introduction\n\nSuccess might be a combination of talent, hard work and luck. One might think that having a conscious strategy will do, but the truth is that we cannot disentangle the outcome and understand if it was this strategy or pure luck\n\nCalling bullshit requires a system. It is based on consistency, for instance in at least two dimensions of the following:\n- Personal experience\n- Experience of people you know\n- Experts\n- Scientific studies\n- Common sense\n- Pattern recognition\n\n# The tine I was crazy\nHe could talk to his cat,being a song or read a poem but he could not talk to other humans. This lead to doctors, psychiatry and loneliness.\n\nHe had to speak at an event in front of 1000 people and he was wondering if he would be able to do it \n\n# The day of the talk\n`when you stand in front of an audience your sensation of time is distorted. That's why inexperienced presenters speak too rapidly.`\n\nHe puts himself in that situation because he embraces failure as a path to learn \n\n# Passion is bullshit\nPassionate people show high energy and are persuasive about their passion but they are also less risk averse.\n\nPassion is a signal that you are good at something or that it is easy for you. Success causes passion more than passion causes success. \n\n# Goals versus systems\n\nCareer advice by a CEO: Every time you land a new job you should start looking for a better one. Job seeking as an ongoing process as better deals has their own schedule. Instead of setting a goal such as his boss' job, his system was to continually look for better options.\n\nGoals makes you feel miserable once you achieve them. Systems makes you feel energetic as they succeed every time you apply the system.\n\nWe can think of goals as situations in which once you succeed you are done, while systems are those that you do periodically with an expectation that they will get you to a better place.\n\nA system beats passion everytime. \n\n# My system\n\nBuild something easy to reproduce in unlimited quantities. This general strategy was narrow down with a focus on creativity. \n\n# Deciding versus wanting\n\n\u003e if you want success, figure out the price then pay it \n\nPrices: sacrifice personal life for grades, putting off having kids, taking business risks...\n\nSystems make the price lower so it may worth a go.\n\n# The selfishness illusion\n\nIn terms of generosity, three kinds of people:\n- Selfish\n- Stupid\n- Burden on others\n\nAdvocates for selfishness understood as a long run view of the right choices for you and others. For instance invest time on fitness, eating right, pursuing your career and spending quality time with your family and friends.\n\n# The energy metric\n\nIn order to make choices among different alternatives we can choose those that maximize ones energy. That leads to eating, dreamin, resting and also by having something in life that excites you. \n\nEnergy is something that gives you a positive lift, mentally or physically. It might be blogging, writing a book, exercising or building your own thing.\n\nA positive externality of good energy is that it gives a boost to the people around you.\n\nYou should manage energy as budgets in a company, seeking to maximize lo#ng term growth.\n\n## Matching mental state to activity\nYou should match your mood and energy levels to the activity, for instance creative tasks at the beginning of the day or exercise at noon. \n\n## Simplifiers va optimizers\nSimplifiers look for the easy Pareto solution although knowing that extra effor would lead to better outcomes.\n\nOptimizers aim for the best solution although it may increase the odds of failure.\n\n``Simplification is usually the right answer when you need communication with others. Optimizing might be worth when you so things on your own or with a closed partner ``\n\nHumans are bad at good at following simple systems and these are also less subject to unexpected failures.\n\nSimple systems are probably the best way to achieve success. Once you have success, optimizing begins to have more value. \n\n\u003e  Simplification frees up energy and time.\n\n\n\n## Tidyness\nIf your work space is a mess it distracts you and steals your energy. Tidy up for an energy boost.\n\n## Knowledge and the lack thereof\nA big energy killer Is the fear that you do not know how to do something your job would require.\n\nTo avoid this:\n- Ask questions and you usually find simple solution or cheap professionals that do it \n- Flash research in Google to check out are the stuff that worries you so much\n\n## Don't be an asshole\n\nBeing an asshole causes energy drains all around and it might involve spending energy cleaning up the mess you made.\n\n## Priorities\n\n1. You. Health\n2. Economics\n3. Family, friends, lovers\n4. Local community, country, world\n\nKeep your priorities straight by judging how options affect your personal energy\n\n# Managing your attitude\n\nYou can manipulate your thoughts to manage your attitude.\nButtons: Exercise, food, sleep. Avoid depressing news. \n\nFake smiles, daydreaming fake it till you make it. Acting confident makes you feel confident. Feeling energetic makes you feel like playing a sport Playing a sport makes you feel energetic. \n\nSuccess at anything has a spillover effect on other things. Once you become good at unimportant things such as hobbies or sports, you are more prepared to be successful in more important challenges.\n\nYou should manipulate your perceptions to whatever makes you happy, because you are probably wrong about the nature of reality anyway.\n\n\n# My speaking career\n\nAsked for a price for giving a speech that he did not want to give he asked for 5k. \n\nThe speaking requests flowed in as he entered the speaking circuit after overpricing himself.\n\n# Recognizing your talents and knowing when to quit\n\nYou can achieve something extraordinary by combining ordinary talents (vs gifted extraordinary innate world class talent)\n\nYou can recognise your talents by:\n- Checking what you did obsessively as a kid\n- Tolerance for risk. We accept high risk when we expect high returns.\n\nA system to achieve success involves trying lots of different things (sampling). This contradicts the general wisdom of sticking to it.\n\nHow you can tell when to quit? Things that work out started out well. \n\n\u003e small successes can grow into big ones, but failures rarely grow into successes\n\nSuccesses have X factor, meaning that you should focus if a segment of the audience is enthusiastic about it, instead of focusing in average responses. X factor can be detected by what users do with your product, instead of what they are saying.\n\n# Is practicing your thing?\n\nSome people enter in flow mode when they are practicing (endless repetition) while for others this is hell on earth. The latter usually prefer gaining experience on a variety of functions or knowledge.\n\n# Managing your odds for success\n\nSuccess formil: Every skill you acquire doubles your odds of success.\n\nGood + Good \u003e Excellent\n\nThe power of leveraging multiple mediocre skills and also because everytime you learn a new skill it makes learning new skills easier.\n\n\n`The more you know the more you can know.`\n\nReading newspapers to broaden you exposure to new topics which rewires your brains and provides with energy boosts. \n\n\n# The math of success\n\nYou can't control luck. But you can move from a game with low odds of success to a game with odds more favourable to you.\n\n\nList of skills that every adult should have working knowledge:\n\n### Public speaking\nTook a Dale Carnegie public speaking class.\n\n\u003e When I am on stage, it is a good day for me, I am the happiest person in the room. The audience only gets to listen, I get to speak, to feel, to be fully alive. I will absorb their energy and turn into something good. \n\nThe transformative power of praise versus the corrosive impact of criticism.\n\n### Psychology\nIt is important to understand how the brain perceives the world. \n\nSalespeople know that you can manipulate buyers by controlling what they compare.\n\n\u003e Quality is not an independent force of the universe, it depends on what you choose as your frame of reference.\n\nIt includes a large list of cognitive biases and mental models.\n\nIn order to succeed do more of what works and less of what doesn't.\n\nPeople do not usually use reason for their big decisions in life. Do not think of people as rational beings. \n\nHe suggests that we need to embrace psychology and try to be lifelong learners.\n\n### Business writing\nGet a course. Get rid of unnecessary words and passive voice.\n\n### Accounting\nCash flow projections, spreadsheet, time value of money.\n\n### Design\nYou can learn rules and tricks of design to be effective in designing PowerPoints, flyers or whatsoever.\n\n### Conversation\n\nReasons to have a conversation:\n- Exchange information\n- Plan\n- Complain\n- Entertain\n- Feel connected\n- Befriend\n- Seduce\n- Persuade\n- Be polite\n- Avoid awkward silence\n- Brag\n\nHow to make a conversation with strangers:\n\n- Ask questions till you find a mutual interest:\n\t- What's your name?\n\t- Where do you live?\n\t- Do you have a family?\n\t- What do you do for a living?\n\t- Do you have any hobbies/sports?\n\t- Do you have any travel plans?\n- Don't complain\n- Don't talk about boring experiences\n- Don't dominate the conversation\n- Don't get stuck on a topic. Keep moving\n- Planning is useful but it is not a conversation\n- Keep the sas stories short\n\nThe six questions might make you feel awkward but people love talking about themselves and it is very easy for everyone. You work as a conversationalist is to keep asking questions till you find what you have in common with the stranger. The point is to make the other person feel good.\n\n#### How to become a master of short but interesting stories?\nOr how to translate interesting experience into story form. Good storytelling needs preparation, and that means following a structure:\n- Setup: keep it brief, one sentence or two.\n- Pattern: establish a pattern your story will violate\n- Foreshadowing: you leave clues where the story is going\n- The characters: fill the story with personality traits\n- Relatability: pick story topics your listeners will relate to \n- The waist: no plot twist, no story. \n- Topics to avoid\n\t- Food\n\t- TV plots\n\t- Dreams\n\t- Medical stories\n\n### Overcoming shyness\nOne technique involves imagining you are acting instead of interacting. A shy person can act like someone else more easily than acting like himself. Fake it till you make it.\n\nAnother technique is acting interested in other people. \n\nAlso try to classify people in two classes: thing people (love talking about tech, politics, tools and possessions, processes and systems) and people people (love talking about people doing interesting things), they get easily bored about thing topics.\n\nLearn from outgoing people by observing them.\n\n### Second language\nLearn a second language.\n\n### Golf\nNot for business but for bonding with other males. It is also vacation for the mind.\n\n### Proper grammar\n\nYou don't want to sound like a moron/hillbilly.\n\n### Persuasion\nYou always have to try to convince people.\n\nReally enjoyed the take on this (p 135)\nUseful expressions:\n- Because\n- Would you mind...?\n- I'm not interested\n- I don't do that\n- I have a rule\nI just wanted to clarify\nIs there anything you can do for me?\nThank you\nThis is just between you and me\n\nWhen situations are uncertain and complicated they look for leadership and decisiveness sometimes looks like leadership. So if you deliver decisiveness some people will picture you as a leader.\n\nYou can also persuade others by sharing your enthusiasm.\n\n### Technology\nYou should have basic understanding of tech for working at startups, conversations and self preservation\n\n### Proper voice technique\nYou need breath control (from the belly button, not chest), tone (deep low tones) and mouth strategies. Posture is also important. \n\n# Pattern recognition\n\n### Successful people patterns\n\nThe seven habits of highly effective people by Stephen Covey:\n1. Be proactive\n2. Begin with the end in mind\n3. Put first things first\n4. Think win-win\n5. Seek first to understand then be understood\n6. Synergize \n7. Sharpen the saw\n\nAnd Adams add:\n- Lack of fear of embarrassment: Bravery\n- Education\n- Exercise: physical exercise brings energy, creativity, bravery...\n\n# Humor\nHumor makes you look more attractive and confident. It also helps you out life in perspective.\n\nIn-person humor requires effort but it does not demand too high quality.\n\nAvoid humor traps:\n- Overcomplaining\n- Don't overdo the selfdeprecaition\n- Don't mock people\n- Avoid puns and wordplay\n\n# Affirmations\nAffirmations consist of repeating what you want to achieve while you imagine it.\n\nI, Pelay Arbues, will become a...\n\nIt is not magical thinking, it is about increasing focus. \n\n# Timing is luck too\nTiming is the greatest form of luck. You have to synchronise with the universe. You can increase the odds by working hard, but it still works that way.\n\n# Experts\nThey are right 98% of the time on the easy stuff and 50% on complicated, rare or misterious stuff \n\n# Association programming\n\nKnew a guy that thought that he could became rich if he was surrounded by rich people. It might make sense because you learn by example, your energy might be boosted by seeing your goal live and direct.\n\nPeople surrounded by overweight people is more prone to gain weight.\n\n# Happiness\nGoal in life: maximize lifetime experience of happiness.\n\nScience of happiness: happiness isn't as dependent of your circumstances as you may think. \n\nYou can get 80% of happiness by manipulating your body chemistry. Tips:\n- Being able to do what you want, *when* you want. The timing can be more important than the things. A mediocre meal when you are starving \u003e delicious meal when you are not hungry. A flexible schedule might make you really happy, so work towards flexible schedule.\n- Happiness is more related to the direction of the vector than the position of the point. You feel happy when things move in the right direction and bad when they has a downward trend. Sports provide you a feeling of progress.\n- Imagining a brighter future also brings joy. Recall the daydreaming chapter.\n\nBad mood is usually the result of good food, sleeping, exercise, imagination , flexible schedule and routine.\n\n# Diet\nDiet that works: eat as much as you want, of anything you want, whenever you want.\n\nYour food preferences change thoroughout your life and you can deliberately change your preferences. Cravings can be manipulated. You can erase and gro cravings for unhealthy and healthy food. \n\n## Food is mood\nIn order to change perception of healthy food you need you need to look at things differently. \n\nThink of yourself as a programmable robot. Eating right makes you less vulnerable to the bumps of life. \n\n## look for the pattern\n\nTest the *food is mood* claim by testing it and observing your mood depending on your recent meals. Which meals make you feel energetic Vs sleepy? \n\n## The food-exercise connection\n\nFood is the fuel that makes exercise possible because it can turn your lazy mood to energetic.\n\n### Breaking the simple carb addiction\n\nIn order to reduce the willpower necessary to avoid simple carbs (white rice, bread, potatoes). The system is to break addiction to simple carbs and you can do it by eating as much as you want from other meals.\n\n### how to know what to eat\nNutrition science is full of bullshit and very incomplete. \n\n### know why you are eating\nWhen you don't get enough sleep you have a bold hunger sensation. This can be calmed with nuts and chease. \n\n### how to make healthy food taste good\nAvoid healthy but boring and awful food. Eating that requires too much willpower and it is unsustainable. \nExperiment with veggies and:\n- Butter\n- Salt\n- Cheese\n- Soy sauce\n\nProteins:\n- Edamame\n- Nuts\n- Pasta\n- Cheese\n- Veggies\n\n## Coffee\nCoffee makes you enjoy your daily routine. 2-4 cups a day can make you more eager to exercise.\n\n\n\n![[IMG_20220601_002744.jpg]]\n\n# Fitness\n\n## Be active everyday\n\nIf you are active everyday, all other physical exercise will require much less willpower. And no willpower requirements is essential for the system to work.\n\nThe system is being active everyday, and all forms of exercise will do: take a walk, play basketball, clean garage...\n\nPractical ways to schedule exercise:\n- Join an organised team\n- Always exercise at the same time everyday\n- Exercise with your partner\n\n## Motivation to exercise\nYou need a good diet for having the energy to work out. And you don't want to overexercise so much you don't want to be active the next day. Also soreness is a penalty for exercise.\n\nBe active everyday and avoid setting specific days for exercise. Rest days break the habit.\n\n## Rewards\nHealthy snack, read articles on the phone or a cup of coffee.\n\nCoffee can help you to get in the mood of exercise.\n\nPut on exercise clothes an sneakers and allow yourself to not exercise.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.494115022Z","tags":null},"/literature-notes/Books/How-to-lead-in-Data-Science":{"title":"How to lead in Data Science","content":"\n```\n\n```\n\n***\n**Author**: [Jike Chong], [Cathy Chang]\n**Source**: [How to Lead in Data Science](https://www.manning.com/books/how-to-lead-in-data-science)\n**Tags**:  #triage\n***\n\n# 1.

Assemble notes putting arguments and put them into order\n2. Write a draft\n3. Review it and correct it\n\nThe main work here is not taking notes but thinking, reading and coming up with new ideas.\n\n## Step by step\n\n1. Fleeting notes. Sketch ideas, reminders of what is in your head. Put them in the inbox and process them later. If idea is already mature, go directly to write a permanent note in the slip box.\n2. Literature notes. When reading, watching videos or podcast write down what catches your attention and might be reusable. **Write it with your own words**. Keep the notes in the reference system.\n3. Permanent notes. Go to the slip-box and process notes taken in step 1 and 2. Write a new idea that comes into your mind. **One idea, one note ** write in a clear concise way but it must be self contained disclosing references and sources. Discard fleeting notes and move literature notes to reference system.\n4. Add permanent notes to slip box. Add links to related notes, link the notes in a MoC or index.\n5. Develop your topics by exploring the slip box, search for clusters of ideas, contradictions and find arguments that need further research and exploration.\n6. At this point there should be enough ideas to decide the topic to write about. Look through connections and collect relevant notes. Look for missing and redundant information. Go back to reading and develop new ideas.\n7. Write a rough draft. Translate the notes into a coherent text. Detect holes in the argument, fill them or change the argument.\n8. Edit and submit the paper.\n\nIn the process you will find many accidental ideas that you were not expecting to find when you started. Don't waste this ideas because they do not fit the topic you are currently working on. Instead save them, process them and generate new ideas.\n\n# The 4 underlying principles\n\n## Writing is the only thing that matters\n\n``` Working as if nothing else counts than writing```\n\nTaking notes involves more focused reading, as you cannot write everything down and you always rephrase the contents in your own words (pushing you to understand the core ideas).\n\nBy doing everything with the purpose of writing means that you do it deliberately. \n\n## Simplicity is paramount\nThe slip box is not arranged by topics, but it is simoky linked so that instead of forcing you to remember where you store them you focus on finding forgotten ideas and creating new ones \n\nIn order to work we need a critical mass of notes and distinguish between 3 kind of notes:\n- Fleeting notes: remainders of information, it can be thrown away once processed. Capture ideas while you are doing something else \n- Permanent notes: self-explanatory and fully understandable without more context. They are not reminders of thoughts or ideas, but the actual thought. \n- Project notes: relevant only for one project, might be archived once the project is done.\n\n\n\n\nA typical mistake in note taking workflow is considering all notes as permanent. Good ideas are diluted among irrelevant information. \n\nOther problem is to only take project related notes. You can't restrict your thinking to a narrow project, instead new information and ideas on other topics will emerge while researching. It is tempting to try to open new projects to dump these new ideas, but in that case you end up with a lot of unfinished projects.\n\nIn the case of treating all notes as fleeting ones, what follows is chaos and the need to clean up and start all over again.\n\n## Nobody ever starts from scratch\nUsually scientific workflows follow this structure:\n- Choose a topic\n- plan research\n- do research\n- write\n\nTruth is that writing is not that linear.\n\nIn order to do the first step, choose a topic, you should have already read and thought about a bunch of topics.\n\nMost how to guides rely heavily on brainstorming, because it is the only thing left when you have not been taken proper notes.\n\nFinding a topic it is just follow the threads in the slip box, while it is a frustrating experience when you have not been writing while studying.\n\n## Let the work carry you be forward\n\nWhen you are working in flow mode, the own work generates momentum to keep on working. For that to happen, the workflow must be rewarding so that the dynamics of work and reward yield a feedback loop that motivates you to keep on working.\n\n[[Growth mindset]]: seek and welcome feedback. Means finding pleasure out of changing for the better instead of receiving praise. Being praised for what you are, instead of what you do might lead you to have a fixed mindset.\n\nTaking notes is a form of increasing the frequency of feedback. Instead of waiting for a paper review we obtain feedback on our notes as writing them test our understanding and our hability to explain them concisely. Reviewing our notes to take permanent notes, means realizing that we do not fully understand an idea and hence we can work on it. This leads to better writing, faster note taking and deeper reading. \n\n# The six steps to successful writing\n\n## 1. Separate and interlocking tasks\n\nAttention deficit caused by multitasking and information overload lowers productivity. You can not get better at multitasking as no one is able to focus on more than one thing at a time. Instead what we do is to switch focus really fast what in the end drains our attention.\n\nHere we are talking about sustained attention, no Mt about focus attention or flow ( a state of highly focused and effortless attention)\n\nAn organised workflow might improve our sustained attention by separating tasks and pushing us to focus on one thing for longer.\n\nWriting also involves very different tasks such as proof reading, acting as a external reviewer and writing itself. Other tasks are developing thoughts, outlining. The same happens with reading, some texts need our full attention while others might be skimmed.\n\nSuccessful problem solving, as it is done by eminent scholars, involves deep focus spans of time and flexible playful moments.\n\nBesides attention, we must also take into account the importance of writing on order to free up our short term memory. It has been demonstrated that we can only hold 7+-2 things at a time in our head, that's why it is so important to dump our thoughts to a system that takes removes the need to keep in mind what we were thinking or doing.\n\nZeigarnik effect: open tasks are a burden for our short term memory till they are done. Done or written down. We can trick our brains so that they no longer worry about that task. \n\nBesides attention, and short term memory there is a third scarce recourse: motivation or willpower. Ego depletion refers to a drain of willpower caused by prior use of volition. \n\nStandardised working environment reduces cognitive load (see [[pelayoarbues/02.Reference-System/_Notes/Team Cognitive Load]]) which reduces willpower to a lesser extent .\n\n## 2. Read for understanding\n\nReading with pen and paper is the way to translate other people's ideas into our own coherent thought. This is quite different than copying and pastin, since even using the same expression as the author they will be less meaningful than our own words.\n\nAfter finishing the book, go through the notes and see if you can relate them with any note at the slip box.\n\nConfirmation bias is one of the major flaws of human reasoning. Slip box allows us to gather facts and ideas that connect with other thoughts independently if they are addition or contradictions. The only thing that matters is that if it's relevant or irrelevant.\n\nRe-reading, cramming and re-reviewring are not effective for learning, just for passing the test. A much more successful learning method is elaboration (thinking about the meaning of what we read, how it can inform different topics and and linking to other topics). \n\n## 3. Take Smart notes\n\nEffective reading means being able to read a text linkinh it to other topics and find missing arguments. A common problem of inexperienced readers is that the stick to the frame where the tamezt lives.\n\nWriting can be thought as an external arena where the true process of thinking occurs. It allows us to see our thoughts in perspective which is exactly what we need to keep them as rational as possible and far from the reach of brains shortcuts. \n\nWe can measure memory capabilities in terms of:\n- Storage strength: ability to store memories\n- retrieval strength: ability to build connections between memories\n\n\n## 4.Develop ideas\n\nThe slip box is where our thinking occurs. It is then impossible to keep it constrained inside artificial boundaries. That is why there are no categories for the permanent notes, but connections with other thoughts.\n\nIn order to develop topics we might use an index that links to notes via tags, but what it is more important is the links between notes so that we enter into the realm of surprise and concrete thoughts.\n\nAnother way is to create a note that overviews a topic.\n\nIn order to choose a keyword we should think as writers instead of archivists, and look for in which circumstances we want to come across with this thought. Keywords should be chosen while keeping an eye on the topics we are interested to develop, not in isolation. \n\nTypes of cross references:\n- links in notes reviewing a topic. \n- note-to-note links\n\nThe process of linking notes is a core point of thinking. And leaning on the slip box, as an external source of ideas, we are less prone to imagine connections where there aren't any.\n\nWorking with the slip box is sometimes disillusioning as weay think that one idea we are excited about is ours and novel and when we check the slip box might be already there (we have forgot about it) and it may not be ours. This is not only bad news as we may usually confront ideas or find subtle but interesting differences between them, sparking new discussion.\n\n\n\u003e Build a lattice of mental models to get a grip on reality. Charlie Munger\n\n\nCreativity and generation of new ideas depends more on breaking old habits of thinking.\n\nStructure and restrictions, although it sounds counterintuitive, are a source of scientific progress and creativity.\n\n## Share your insight\n\nThe slip box allows us to easily find a topic to write about. This is because our own motivations are already there: in each note we take, in every literature note we write, we are saving those thoughts that are more important to us. ==It is evolution applied to ideas and thoughts.==\n\nTruly understanding something means that we can spot it's limitations. That is the reason why are more open to new ideas the more familiar we are with certain thoughts. You may just fall in love with a particular idea that you are somewhat familiar with. But once you go deeper, find new perspectives on the topic and think on its drawbacks you might be able to find something that becomes a breakthrough innovation.\n\nWork on different manuscripts at the same time. That prevents you from blockages and also takes advantage of by-products generated by each project which might generate new projects which generate more by-products and so on.\n\nZeigarnik effect. Our brains are occupied with a task till it is accomplished or written down. Every long work fills the time we set aside for it while short tasks are often speed up. It is important to get started and do it with feasible tasks (take a note is much better than working on vague and I'll defined task such as keep working an overdue paper)\n\nOne of the hardest parts of reviewing a draft is to get rid (cut) some parts. For this purpose it is a good practice to cut the sentences and paragraphs that don't fit in the manuscript to other document in order to reuse them. Although you may never use them, it helps you psychologically to \"kill your darlings\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.494115022Z","tags":null},"/literature-notes/Books/Las-Gafas-De-La-Felicidad":{"title":"Las Gafas De La Felicidad","content":"# Las Gafas De La Felicidad\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41zOEbDADSL._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Rafael Santandreu]]\n- Full Title: Las Gafas De La Felicidad\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- Epicteto, el filósofo griego, lo puso de otra forma: «No nos afecta lo que nos sucede, sino lo que nos decimos acerca de lo que nos sucede».

Le salieron 3 grupos:   ¡Debo! hacer las cosas siempre bien. La gente me ¡debe! tratar bien. El mundo ¡debe! funcionar de forma correcta.   Fijémonos que las creencias irracionales son siempre «deberías», exigencias absolutistas cargadas de presión y con la absurda lógica de la obligación. Y podemos perpetrarlas en relación con nosotros mismos, a los demás y al mundo.

No necesito que TODO el mundo me trate bien TODO el tiempo. El mundo nunca ha funcionado perfectamente y, pese a eso, mucha gente ha conseguido disfrutar de la vida. Yo también puedo hacerlo.   Las creencias racionales son mucho más lógicas, sosegadas y maduras; producen ilusión por mejorar las cosas, pero sin obsesionarse con determinado resultado, y son la elección de las personas más fuertes y sanas.

Me dicen: «Es cierto, Rafael, tenemos demasiadas cosas. Esta sociedad de consumo es una exageración». Pero frecuentemente no caemos en que la «bastantidad» también hace referencia a los bienes inmateriales. En Occidente somos insaciables también en referencia a las virtudes, los amigos, la salud, el amor sentimental, la cultura, la extroversión, la necesidad de respeto, la libertad, la pasión vital, el entretenimiento...

([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00IPPKBWY\u0026location=326))\n- Podríamos definir las creencias irracionales como:   ideas autopresionantes superexigencias ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00IPPKBWY\u0026location=330))\n- creencias racionales que son:   renuncias que simplifican la vida ideas que nos sacan presión ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00IPPKBWY\u0026location=333))\n- Albert Ellis, el padre de la psicología cognitiva, estableció una clasificación de todas las creencias irracionales que pueden existir —y puede haber infinitas—. Le salieron 3 grupos:   ¡Debo! hacer las cosas siempre bien. La gente me ¡debe! tratar bien. El mundo ¡debe! funcionar de forma correcta.   Fijémonos que las creencias irracionales son siempre «deberías», exigencias absolutistas cargadas de presión y con la absurda lógica de la obligación. Y podemos perpetrarlas en relación con nosotros mismos, a los demás y al mundo. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00IPPKBWY\u0026location=338))\n- Las creencias racionales, las que nos permiten disfrutar de la vida, se parecen a las siguientes aseveraciones:   Para ser feliz, no es necesario hacerlo TODO bien, sino con amor. No necesito que TODO el mundo me trate bien TODO el tiempo. El mundo nunca ha funcionado perfectamente y, pese a eso, mucha gente ha conseguido disfrutar de la vida. Yo también puedo hacerlo.   Las creencias racionales son mucho más lógicas, sosegadas y maduras; producen ilusión por mejorar las cosas, pero sin obsesionarse con determinado resultado, y son la elección de las personas más fuertes y sanas. Todos podemos aprender a manejarlas. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00IPPKBWY\u0026location=347))\n- Un famoso psicólogo cognitivo llamado Anthony de Mello empleaba la palabra «bastantidad» para definir el estilo de pensamiento de las personas emocionalmente fuertes. La «bastantidad» consiste en darse cuenta de que los seres humanos necesitamos muy poco para estar bien. La «bastantidad» es decirnos «ya tengo bastante» en cada momento de nuestra vida. En todos. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00IPPKBWY\u0026location=357))\n- la «bastantidad», virtud que se basa en el presupuesto de que todos los seres humanos necesitamos muy poco para estar bien. En concreto, sólo necesitamos la comida y el agua del día, y quizá un poco de cobijo para los días fríos, pero poco más. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00IPPKBWY\u0026location=394))\n- Siempre que hablo de «bastantidad», la gente suele darme la razón en cuanto a los bienes materiales. Me dicen: «Es cierto, Rafael, tenemos demasiadas cosas. Esta sociedad de consumo es una exageración». Pero frecuentemente no caemos en que la «bastantidad» también hace referencia a los bienes inmateriales. En Occidente somos insaciables también en referencia a las virtudes, los amigos, la salud, el amor sentimental, la cultura, la extroversión, la necesidad de respeto, la libertad, la pasión vital, el entretenimiento...

You can watch as they appear in your mind, seemingly from thin air, and watch again as they disappear, like a soap bubble bursting. You come to the profound understanding that thoughts and feelings (including negative ones) are transient. They come and they go, and ultimately, you have a choice about whether to act on them or not. ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=191))\n    - Tags: [[favorite]] \n- when you start to feel a little sad, anxious, or irritable it’s not the mood that does the damage but how you react to it. • the effort of trying to free yourself from a bad mood or bout of unhappiness – of working out why you’re unhappy and what you can do about it – often makes things worse. It’s like being trapped in quicksand – the more you struggle to be free, the deeper you sink. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=242))\n    - Tags: [[favorite]] \n- When you begin to feel a little unhappy, it’s natural to try and think your way out of the problem of being unhappy. You try to establish what is making you unhappy and then find a solution. In the process, you can easily dredge up past regrets and conjure up future worries. This further lowers your mood. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=247))\n- The mind is constantly trawling through memories to find those that echo our current emotional state. For example, if you feel threatened, the mind instantly digs up memories of when you felt endangered in the past, so that you can spot similarities and find a way of escaping. It happens in an instant, before you’re even aware of it. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=254))\n- The same is true with unhappiness, anxiety and stress. It is normal to feel a little unhappy from time to time, but sometimes a few sad thoughts can end up triggering a cascade of unhappy memories, negative emotions and harsh judgments. Before long, hours or even days can be coloured by negative self-critical thoughts such as, What’s wrong with me? My life is a mess. What will happen when they discover how useless I really am? Such self-attacking thoughts are incredibly powerful, and once they gather momentum they are almost impossible to stop. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=258))\n    - Tags: [[favorite]] \n- Similarly, our mood can act as an internal context that is every bit as powerful as a visit to an old holiday destination or the sound of a favourite tune. A flicker of sadness, frustration or anxiety can bring back unsettling memories, whether you want them or not. Soon you can be lost in gloomy thoughts and negative emotions. And often you don’t know where they came from – they just appeared, seemingly from thin air. You can become bad tempered, irritable or sad without really knowing why. You’re left wondering, Why am I in a bad mood? Or, Why do I feel so sad and tired today? ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=273))\n- The spirit in which you do something is often as important as the act itself. Think about the significance of this for a moment. If you do something in a negative or critical way, if you over-think or worry or carry out a task through gritted teeth, then you will activate your mind’s aversion system. This will narrow the focus of your life. You will become like a mouse with an owl complex: more anxious, less flexible, less creative. If, however, you do exactly the same thing in an open-hearted, welcoming manner, you thereby activate the mind’s ‘approach’ system: ([Location 1647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=1647))\n- And nothing activates the mind’s avoidance system (and depresses the approach system) quite like the feeling of being trapped. This sense of being trapped is also central to extreme feelings of exhaustion and helplessness. Many people who work too hard, or for too long, end up being trapped by their own perfectionism and sense of responsibility – they feel, deep down, that there is ‘no escape’. It might be that, some time in the past, they had to prove something to themselves or to others because they felt bullied into it at home or at school, but over the years this has turned into a script that keeps them locked into old habits. This bullying script may once have helped them get what they wanted in life, but now it simply exhausts them. In this way, it’s all too easy to cede all the power to the ‘self-attacking’ aspect of yourself, and over time, you can come to feel, deep down, that the only possible response is to submit to the pressure. Trapped, your world seems to present fewer and fewer alternatives for action, whatever the reality. The result is long-term ‘demobilisation’. Your playfulness becomes paved over with concrete. ([Location 1653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=1653))\n- Although these negative spirals are incredibly powerful, you can begin to dissipate them just by becoming aware of them. The simple act of turning towards and observing them, helps to dissolve such patterns because they are maintained by the mind’s Doing mode (which has volunteered to help, even though it’s precisely the wrong tool for the job). The Doing mode entangles you even more in your own ideas of freedom, adding a sense of deep aversion and the demand that things should be different from how they are. So you become caught in a fantasy of freedom and miss the actuality of freedom available to you. ([Location 1666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=1666))\n- John was on his way to school. He was worried about the maths lesson. He was not sure he could control the class again today. It was not part of a janitor’s duty.1 ([Location 1938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=1938))\n- The way we interpret the world makes a huge difference to how we react. This is sometimes called the ABC model of emotions. The ‘A’ represents the situation itself – what a video camera would record. The ‘B’ is the interpretation given to the scene; the running story we create out of the situation, which often flows just beneath the surface of awareness but is taken as fact. The ‘C’ is our reactions: our emotions, body sensations and our impulses to act in various ways. Often, we see the ‘A’ and ‘C’ quite clearly, but we are not aware of the ‘B’. We think that the situation itself aroused our feelings and emotions when, in fact, it was our interpretation of the scene that did this. It’s as if the world were a silent film on which we write our own commentary. But the commentary, with its explanations of what is going on, happens so fast that we take it to be part of the film. It can become progressively more difficult to separate the ‘real’ facts of a situation from its interpretation. ([Location 1954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=1954))\n- Take self-criticism as an example: when we are feeling stressed or vulnerable, we only hear the inner critic and not the quieter voice of compassion. If we do hear an alternative to the unsettling thoughts, we probably won’t believe the answers because the emotional punch behind the thoughts is so powerful that it overwhelms all of our logic. If we dismiss our thoughts as ‘nonsense’ or tell ourselves to ‘get a grip’ or to ‘pull yourself together’ then this further lowers our morale, leaving us wide open to further feelings of weakness and inadequacy. To make matters even worse, every time the tape of self-criticism begins to roll, we immediately start embellishing the story. We begin trawling our minds for supporting evidence and ignore everything to the contrary. Is it any wonder then, that the rumour mill in our minds can cause us so much unnecessary suffering?

Think about the significance of this for a moment. If you do something in a negative or critical way, if you over-think or worry or carry out a task through gritted teeth, then you will activate your mind’s aversion system. This will narrow the focus of your life. You will become like a mouse with an owl complex: more anxious, less flexible, less creative. If, however, you do exactly the same thing in an open-hearted, welcoming manner, you thereby activate the mind’s ‘approach’ system: ([Location 1647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=1647))\n- And nothing activates the mind’s avoidance system (and depresses the approach system) quite like the feeling of being trapped. This sense of being trapped is also central to extreme feelings of exhaustion and helplessness. Many people who work too hard, or for too long, end up being trapped by their own perfectionism and sense of responsibility – they feel, deep down, that there is ‘no escape’. It might be that, some time in the past, they had to prove something to themselves or to others because they felt bullied into it at home or at school, but over the years this has turned into a script that keeps them locked into old habits. This bullying script may once have helped them get what they wanted in life, but now it simply exhausts them. In this way, it’s all too easy to cede all the power to the ‘self-attacking’ aspect of yourself, and over time, you can come to feel, deep down, that the only possible response is to submit to the pressure. Trapped, your world seems to present fewer and fewer alternatives for action, whatever the reality. The result is long-term ‘demobilisation’. Your playfulness becomes paved over with concrete.

The simple act of turning towards and observing them, helps to dissolve such patterns because they are maintained by the mind’s Doing mode (which has volunteered to help, even though it’s precisely the wrong tool for the job). The Doing mode entangles you even more in your own ideas of freedom, adding a sense of deep aversion and the demand that things should be different from how they are. So you become caught in a fantasy of freedom and miss the actuality of freedom available to you.

This is sometimes called the ABC model of emotions. The ‘A’ represents the situation itself – what a video camera would record. The ‘B’ is the interpretation given to the scene; the running story we create out of the situation, which often flows just beneath the surface of awareness but is taken as fact. The ‘C’ is our reactions: our emotions, body sensations and our impulses to act in various ways. Often, we see the ‘A’ and ‘C’ quite clearly, but we are not aware of the ‘B’. We think that the situation itself aroused our feelings and emotions when, in fact, it was our interpretation of the scene that did this. It’s as if the world were a silent film on which we write our own commentary. But the commentary, with its explanations of what is going on, happens so fast that we take it to be part of the film. It can become progressively more difficult to separate the ‘real’ facts of a situation from its interpretation.

If we do hear an alternative to the unsettling thoughts, we probably won’t believe the answers because the emotional punch behind the thoughts is so powerful that it overwhelms all of our logic. If we dismiss our thoughts as ‘nonsense’ or tell ourselves to ‘get a grip’ or to ‘pull yourself together’ then this further lowers our morale, leaving us wide open to further feelings of weakness and inadequacy. To make matters even worse, every time the tape of self-criticism begins to roll, we immediately start embellishing the story. We begin trawling our minds for supporting evidence and ignore everything to the contrary. Is it any wonder then, that the rumour mill in our minds can cause us so much unnecessary suffering?

New rules\n\nMost potent negotiating tool: open questions. Calibrated questions buy you time, make the counterpart feel they are in control.\n\nAsk the same open questions over and over until they give you everything you want.  \n\nWe humans are irrational and that is the reason why fixed process based on logic are not the best techniques for negotiating.\n\nSeminal negotiating scholar works focused on problem solving and agreeing in a mutual game. \n\nKahneman brought the irrationality of man, that we are not completely selfish and that feeling is a form of thinking. Tastes are not stable. And he differentiated two systems. System 1 is our fast animal mind. System 2 is slow and logical. System 1 is more influential because it guides our rational thoughts.\n\nIf you are able to affect system 1 in your counterpart then you can guide his system 2 and modify his responses. Emotional intelligence needs to be central to effective negotiation.\n\nPeople want empathy. They want to be listened. ==Tactical empathy== is active listening aims to balance emotional intelligence and assertive skills of influence.\n\n### Life is negotiation\n\nThe majority of interactions in our daily life are related to an animalistic urge: I want. \n\nNegotiation serves 2 function:\n- Information gathering \n- Behaviour influence \n\n# 2. Be a mirror\n\nBe open minded, question assumptions and be ready to update your beliefs for each new piece of information you get.\n\nGoal is to identify what they actually need and get them feel safe to talk about they want. ==Wants represent the aspiration, needs the minimum to survive, and they make us vulnerable. ==\n\nThe best effective mode of influence is how we enact. Radiate warmth and acceptance. Voice is the most powerful tool for verbal communication. Voice tones for negotiators: positive/playful, \nLate night FM DJ voice (deep, soft, slow), and assertive voice.\n\nMost of the time positive/playful, talking relaxed and smiling. Positive frame of mind make people collaborate instead of fight and resist. \n\nThe late-night FM DJ voice conveys the idea \"I'm in control\".\n\nMirroring, aka isopraxism, is imitation of speech patterns, body language, vocabulary, tempo and tone of voice. S very effective mirror is to repeat last three words. \n\n\n## How to confront\n\n1. Use the late-night FM DJ voice\n2. Start with \"I'm sorry...\"\n3. Mirror\n4. Silence for 4 seconds\n5. Repeat\n\n\n# Key lessons\n\nLanguage of negotiation is a language of conversation and rapport to establish relationships and get people to talk and think together.\n\nKey lessons:\n- A great negotiators aims to use skills to reveal the surprises is certain to find\n- Don't commit to assumptions. View as hypothesis and use negotiation to test them\n- Negotiation is not a battle of arguments, it's a process of discovery  The goal is to uncover as much information as possible \n- To quiet voices in your head focus the other person and what they have to say\n- Slow it down. Hurry makes people think they are not heard \n- Put a smile in your face.\n\nVoices available:\n- The late night FM DJ voice. Use selectively to make a point. You create an aura of authority without triggering defensiveness.\n- The positive/playful voice. Default voice  Easygoing person. Attitude is light and encouraging. Key is relax and smile \n- Direct or assertive voice. Will cause problems and create pushback \n\nMirrors work magic. Repeat last three words. Facilitates bonding. \n\n# 3. Don't feel their pain, label it\n\nEmotions aren't obstacles and the means. If you can perceive other people emotions you can turn them to your advantage. \n\n## Tactical empathy\nEmpathy is \" the ability to recognise the perspective of a counterpart, and the vocalisation of that recognition.\" Try to understand a situation from others perspective.\n\n==Tactical empathy is understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings so you increase your influence in the moments that follow.==\n\nYou can mold your audience by how you approach and talk to them. \n\nNeural resonance is when our brains start to allign. \n\n```\nExercise. When some talks imagine that you are that person  Visualise yourself in the position they describe with as much detail as you can \n```\n\n## Labeling\n\nUse tactical empathy to recognise and understand emotions, turn them into words and respectfully repest back at them.\n\nLabeling builds intimacy. It is a way to validate emotions by acknowledging them. \n\nSteps:\n1. Spot feelings by noticing words, tone and body language. Pay close attention to changes to your words.\n2. Once spotted say it out loud. Labels can be statements or questions. They begin with words such as: \"It seems like...\", \"It sounds like...\", \"It looks like...\".\n3. Silence and listen. Invite the other person to reveal.\n\nNeutralise the negative, reinforce the positive. Peoples emotions has two levels: the surface or presenting behaviour and the underlying feeling that motivates the behaviour.\n\nThe best way to deal with negativity is to observyit without reaction and judgement  Then consciously label each negative feeling and replace it with positive, compassionate and solution based thoughts. \n\nLabeling fears show our counterpart that we understand \n\n## Accusation audit\nList every bad thing your counterpart could say about you.\n\n## Key lessons\n\nThese tools foster human connection and create more meaningful and warm relationships.\n- Imagine yourself in your counterpart situation. By acknowledging the other person's situation they know you are listening and they may disclose useful information.\n- Be open about negatives \n- Silence. After you label a barrier or mirror a statement let it sink in \n- Label tour counterparts fear to diffuse their power.\n- List the worst thinks that the other party could say about you before the other person can. \n- Use labels that reinforce positive perception and dynamics \n\n# 4. Beware yes, master no\nPushing hard for yes does not get you closer to win\n\"No\" is pure goal. It provides a great opportunity to clarify what you really want by eliminating what you don't want.\n\nNo is the starting point of the negotiation. It allows you to be in control, maintain status quo. ==Give people the power of say no, the power of veto==. Great negotiators seek No because they know it is when negotiation begins.\n\n3 kinds of yes: counterfeit, confirmation and commitment. The last one is the one that you want because is the one that lesds to a promise of action.\n\nYou are the voice to make them reach your goal as it was theirs. For that you need to fully grasp what they want. And you get there not with fake smiles but by asking for no.\n\nSaying no makes the speaker feel they are in control and creates security.\n\n```\nInstead of asking do you have a few minutes to talk, ask Is now a bad time to talk?\n\nIn email it couk be a: have you given you on this project?\n```\n\nYou can get a no by mislabeling emotions or desires or ask them what they don't want.\n\n## Key lessons\n\nDisagreeing makes the other part to feel safety and in control. Triggering no gets you to what's really at stake.\n\n- Break the habit of chasing the yes. Pushing people to yes makes people defensive.\n- No usually means wait or that is not what I want. Learn how to hear it calmly\n- Saying no makes the speaker feel safe, secure and in control.\n- Sometimes the only way to make the people engange and devote some time to you is by forcing a no. \"It seems like you want this project to fail\"\n- Negotiate in their world. Let them convince themselves that the solution you want is their own idea.\n- If a potential business partner is ignoring you contar then with s no oriented question.\n\n# That's right.\n\nBehavioural Change Stairway Model: active listening, empathy, rapport, influence and behavioural change. You can start exerting influence is when the counterpart says \"That's right\". It is a subtle epiphany.\n\nA good summary can trigger a \"That's right moment.\". It can be a combination of rearticulating the meaning of what is said plus the acknowledgement of the emotions underlying that meaning. Paraphrasing+ labeling =  Summary.\n\n\"You are right\" is not a good sign because that might agree but they don't own the ppconclusion.\n\n## Key lessons\n\nThat's right moment indicates there is a real understanding between the parties. And when you convince someone that you understand their dreams and feelings, it w\nI'll be possible to influence them \n\n- The more s person feels understood, the more likely they are to be open to constructive behaviour\n- That's right is better than yes, it can create breakthroughs\n- Use summary to trigger that's right.\n\n\n# Bend their reality \n\nNegotiation is never a linear formula. There are leverages in unspoken needs and thoughts.\n\nDon't compromise. Splitting the difference is usually ineffective and disastrous. No deal is better than a bad deal. Mismatched black and brown shoes.\n\n## Deadlines: make time your ally\nTime is a crucial variable in negotiations. Deadlines make people take irrational decisions. Negotiation deadlines are usually imaginary, arbitrary and almost always flexible.  \n\nPatience is a formidable weapon if you believe you got all the time you need to make the negotiation right.\n\nDeadlines cut both ways and when s negotiation is over for one side is over for the other too.\n\n## The fair word\nThree ways to use it:\n- I just want what is fair. Triggers feelings of defensiveness and discomfort. The best response is \"I apologize and go back where I started treating you unfairly and let's fix it\".\n- We have given you a fair offer. It attempts to distract your attention and make you give up. Best response: Fair? 3 secs pause. Use a label: it seems like you are ready to provide the evidence to support this\".\n- I want you to feel you are treating fairly at all times. So please stop at any time if you feel I'm being unfair, and we will address it \n\n## Discover emotional drivers behind what the other party values\n\nYou have to try to get what the counterpart problems, pains and unmet objectives are. If you can get at what petare really buying you can tell them a vision of their problem that leaves the proposal as the perfect solution.\n\nWhat does a babysitter sell? Not child care, but a relaxed evening.\n\n## Bend their reality\n\nProspect theory by Kahneman. People prefer sure things over probabilities.It is ==certainty effect==.\nAnd people will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains. ==Loss aversion==\n\n**Prospect theory tactics**\n\n1. Anchor their emotions\nInflame the other party loss aversion by acknowledging all their fears. Once they have low expectations, play on their loss aversion.\n\n2. Let the other guy go first, most of the time. Let the other side anchor monetary negotiations. Beware that the other side might go for an extreme anchor to bend your reality. If you are dealing with a rookie or someone who does not know the value you can open the negotiation and offer an extreme anchor. Or with an equally informed probyou can move first to make the negotiation go faster.\n3. Establish a range. Instead of I am worth 110k$, say at top places like X,bpeoplr in this job get between 130k and 170k. It does not move the counterpart in defensive position but thinking at higher levels. If you offer a range expect them to come in at the low end. \n4. Pivot to non monetary terms you can bend the other reality by talking nonmonetary terms. For instance, for a talk you may get a low offer, but maybe they don't mind doing some promotion of you helping you with your brand. \n5. Use odd numbers and less rounded. Say 37263 sounds like the result of s thoughtful calculation. They se serious, permanent and immovable.\n6. Surprise with a gift. You can get the counterparty with a mood of generosity by staking an extreme anchor, and after their rejection offering an unrelated gift. \n\n## How to negotiate a better salary\n\n### Be pleasantly persistent on nonsalary terms\nCreate empathy on your boss by talking non salary terms. \n\n### Salary terms without success terms is russian roulette\n\nDefine success KPI to keep the conversation going for next year salary review\n\n### Spark their interest in your success\n\nYour success is your boss success. Make yourself their embassador so they have high stakes in your success.\n\n```\nWhat does it take to be successful here?\n```\n\n## Key lessons\n\n![[IMG_20221221_200736.jpg]]\n\n\n# Create the illusion of control\n\nNegotiation is not a wrestling match in which you need to exhaust your opponent into submission.\n\nClosed questions create tit-for-tat mentality. Our work as persuaders is not to get others believe what we say it is to stop them unbelieving. \n\nCalibrated open questions remove lets you rule the conversation without sounding pushy. Asking for questions is a powerful tool to suspend unbelief. \n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.494115022Z","tags":null},"/literature-notes/Books/Peace-Is-Every-Step":{"title":"Peace Is Every Step","content":"# Peace Is Every Step\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qSdpqKKaL._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Thich Nhat Hanh]]\n- Full Title: Peace Is Every Step\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- We are very good at preparing to live, but not very good at living. We know how to sacrifice ten years for a diploma, and we are willing to work very hard to get a job, a car, a house, and so on. But we have difficulty remembering that we are alive in the present moment, the only moment there is for us to be alive. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=187))\n- Yet even a smile like that is enough to relax all the muscles in our face, to banish all worries and fatigue. A tiny bud of a smile on our lips nourishes awareness and calms us miraculously. It returns to us the peace we thought we had lost. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=206))\n- Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile.

If we keep breathing in and out this way for a few minutes, we become quite refreshed. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=257))\n- Watching a bad TV program, we become the TV program. We are what we feel and perceive. If we are angry, we are the anger. If we are in love, we are love. If we look at a snow-covered mountain peak, we are the mountain. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=275))\n- You can use any sound to remind you to pause, breathe in and out, and enjoy the present moment. The buzzer that goes off when you forget to fasten the seat belt in your car is a bell of mindfulness. Even non-sounds, such as the rays of sunlight coming through the window, are bells of mindfulness that can remind us to return to ourselves, breathe, smile, and live fully in the present moment. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=342))\n- When I was four years old, my mother used to bring me a cookie every time she came home from the market. I always went to the front yard and took my time eating it, sometimes half an hour or forty-five minutes for one cookie. I would take a small bite and look up at the sky. Then I would touch the dog with my feet and take another small bite. I just enjoyed being there, with the sky, the earth, the bamboo thickets, the cat, the dog, the flowers. I was able to do that because I did not have much to worry about. I did not think of the future, I did not regret the past. I was entirely in the present moment, with my cookie, the dog, the bamboo thickets, the cat, and everything. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=347))\n- Eating mindfully is a most important practice of meditation. We can eat in a way that we restore the cookie of our childhood. The present moment is filled with joy and happiness. If you are attentive, you will see it. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=354))\n- We each looked at our tangerine, and the children were invited to meditate on its origins. They saw not only their tangerine, but also its mother, the tangerine tree. With some guidance, they began to visualize the blossoms in the sunshine and in the rain. Then they saw petals falling down and the tiny green fruit appear. The sunshine and the rain continued, and the tiny tangerine grew. Now someone has picked it, and the tangerine is here. After seeing this, each child was invited to peel the tangerine slowly, noticing the mist and the fragrance of the tangerine, and then bring it up to his or her mouth and have a mindful bite, in full awareness of the texture and taste of the fruit and the juice coming out. We ate slowly like that. Each time you look at a tangerine, you can see deeply into it. You can see everything in the universe in one tangerine. When you peel it and smell it, it’s wonderful. You can take your time eating a tangerine and be very happy.

Practicing mindfulness enables us to become a real person. When we are a real person, we see real people around us, and life is present in all its richness. The practice of eating bread, a tangerine, or a cookie is the same.

We turn off the TV, put down our newspaper, and work together for five or ten minutes, setting the table and finishing whatever needs to be done. During these few minutes, we can be very happy. When the food is on the table and everyone is seated, we practice breathing: “Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile,” three times. We can recover ourselves completely after three breaths like this. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=380))\n- we look at each person as we breathe in and out in order to be in touch with ourselves and everyone at the table. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=383))\n- After breathing, we smile. Sitting at the table with other people, we have a chance to offer an authentic smile of friendship and understanding. It is very easy, but not many people do it. To me, this is the most important practice. We look at each person and smile at him or her. Breathing and smiling together is a very important practice. If the people in a household cannot smile at each other, the situation is very dangerous. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=386))\n- After breathing and smiling, we look down at the food in a way that allows the food to become real. This food reveals our connection with the earth. Each bite contains the life of the sun and the earth. The extent to which our food reveals itself depends on us. We can see and taste the whole universe in a piece of bread! Contemplating our food for a few seconds before eating, and eating in mindfulness, can bring us much happiness.

Once you are standing in front of the sink with your sleeves rolled up and your hands in the warm water, it is really quite pleasant. I enjoy taking my time with each dish, being fully aware of the dish, the water, and each movement of my hands. I know that if I hurry in order to eat dessert sooner, the time of washing dishes will be unpleasant and not worth living. That would be a pity, for each minute, each second of life is a miracle. The dishes themselves and the fact that I am here washing them are miracles! ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=414))\n- Washing the dishes is at the same time a means and an end—that is, not only do we do the dishes in order to have clean dishes, we also do the dishes just to do the dishes, to live fully in each moment while washing them. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=423))\n- We feel that there is a vacuum in us and we don’t want to confront it. We don’t like being so busy, but every time we have a spare moment, we are afraid of being alone with ourselves. We want to escape. Either we turn on the television, pick up the telephone, read a novel, go out with a friend, or take the car and go somewhere. Our civilization teaches us to act this way and provides us with many things we can use to lose touch with ourselves.

One smile, one breath, should be for the benefit of the whole day, not just for that moment. We must practice in a way that removes the barrier between practice and non-practice. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=510))\n- We should be able to bring the practice from the meditation hall into our daily lives. We need to discuss among ourselves how to do it. Do you practice breathing between phone calls? Do you practice smiling while cutting carrots? Do you practice relaxation after hours of hard work? These are practical questions. If you know how to apply meditation to dinner time, leisure time, sleeping time, it will penetrate your daily life, and it will also have a tremendous effect on social concerns. Mindfulness can penetrate the activities of everyday life, each minute, each hour of our daily life, and not just be a description of something far away.

The basic condition for being happy is our consciousness of being happy. If we are not aware that we are happy, we are not really happy.

([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=579))\n- Western civilization places so much emphasis on the idea of hope that we sacrifice the present moment. Hope is for the future. It cannot help us discover joy, peace, or enlightenment in the present moment. Many religions are based on the notion of hope, and this teaching about refraining from hope may create a strong reaction.

He did not say anything for quite a long time. The audience was perfectly silent. Everyone seemed to be thinking hard, trying to see the meaning behind the Buddha’s gesture. Then, suddenly, the Buddha smiled. He smiled because someone in the audience smiled at him and at the flower.

But it is more effective to return to our conscious breathing and just observe it, identifying it silently to ourselves: “Breathing in, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me. Breathing out, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me.” Calling a feeling by its name, such as “anger,” “sorrow,” “joy,” or “happiness,” helps us identify it clearly and recognize it more deeply.

Breathing out, I know that I must put all my energy into caring for my anger.” So we avoid thinking about the other person, and we refrain from doing or saying anything as long as our anger persists. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=734))\n- When we are angry, our anger is our very self. To suppress or chase it away is to suppress or chase away our self. When we are joyful, we are the joy. When we are angry, we are the anger. When anger is born in us, we can be aware that anger is an energy in us, and we can accept that energy in order to transform it into another kind of energy. When we have a compost bin filled with organic material which is decomposing and smelly, we know that we can transform the waste into beautiful flowers. At first, we may see the compost and the flowers as opposite, but when we look deeply, we see that the flowers already exist in the compost, and the compost already exists in the flowers. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=737))\n- Breathing in, I know that anger is here. Breathing out, I know that the anger is me. Breathing in, I know that anger is unpleasant. Breathing out, I know this feeling will pass. Breathing in, I am calm. Breathing out, I am strong enough to take care of this anger. ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=767))\n- If we look into our anger, we can see its roots, such as misunderstanding, clumsiness, injustice, resentment, or conditioning. ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=778))\n- If we do not untie our knots when they form, they will grow tighter and stronger. Our conscious, reasoning mind knows that negative feelings such as anger, fear, and regret are not wholly acceptable to ourselves or society, so it finds ways to repress them, to push them into remote areas of our consciousness in order to forget them. Because we want to avoid suffering, we create defense mechanisms that deny the existence of these negative feelings and give us the impression we have peace within ourselves. But our internal formations are always looking for ways to manifest as destructive images, feelings, thoughts, words, or behavior. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=812))\n- When we live with another person, to protect each other’s happiness, we should help one another transform the internal formations that we produce together. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=837))\n- Happiness is no longer an individual matter. If the other person is not happy, we will not be happy either. To transform the other person’s knots will help bring about our own happiness as well. A wife can create internal formations in her husband, and a husband can do so in his wife, and if they continue to create knots in each other, one day there will be no happiness left. Therefore, as soon as a knot is created, the wife, for example, should know that a knot has just been tied in her. She should not overlook it. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=839))\n- In Buddhism, the word “suchness” is used to mean “the essence or particular characteristics of a thing or a person, its true nature.” Each person has his or her suchness. If we want to live in peace and happiness with a person, we have to see the suchness of that person. Once we see it, we understand him or her, and there will be no trouble. We can live peacefully and happily together. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=848))\n- When we bring natural gas into our homes for heating and cooking, we know the suchness of gas. We know that gas is dangerous—it can kill us if we are not mindful. But we also know that we need the gas in order to cook, so we do not hesitate to bring it into our homes. The same is true of electricity. We could get electrocuted by it, but when we are mindful, it can help us, and there is no problem, because we know something about the suchness of electricity. A person is the same. If we do not know enough about the suchness of that person, we may get ourselves into trouble. But if we know, then we can enjoy each other very much and benefit a lot from one another. The key is knowing a person’s suchness. We do not expect a person always to be a flower. We have to understand his or her garbage as well.

They did not intend to make their children suffer. Maybe they received the same kind of seeds from their parents. There is a continuation in the transmission of seeds, and their father and mother might have gotten those seeds from their grandfather and grandmother. Most of us are victims of a kind of living that is not mindful, and the practice of mindful living, of meditation, can stop these kinds of suffering and end the transmission of such sorrow to our children and grandchildren. We can break the cycle by not allowing these kinds of seeds of suffering to be transmitted to our children, our friends, or anyone else. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=871))\n- When we look at our parents with compassion, often we see that our parents are only victims who never had the chance to practice mindfulness. They could not transform the suffering in themselves. But if we see them with compassionate eyes, we can offer them joy, peace, and forgiveness. In fact, when we look deeply, we discover that it is impossible to drop all identity with our parents. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=889))\n- Every time a seed has an occasion to manifest itself, it produces new seeds of the same kind. If we are angry for five minutes, new seeds of anger are produced and deposited in the soil of our unconscious mind during those five minutes. That is why we have to be careful in selecting the kind of life we lead and the emotions we express. When I smile, the seeds of smiling and joy have come up. ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=903))\n- We often ask, “What’s wrong?” Doing so, we invite painful seeds of sorrow to come up and manifest. We feel suffering, anger, and depression, and produce more such seeds. We would be much happier if we tried to stay in touch with the healthy, joyful seeds inside of us and around us. We should learn to ask, “What’s not wrong?” and be in touch with that. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=943))\n- Life is filled with many wonders, like the blue sky, the sunshine, the eyes of a baby. Our breathing, for example, can be very enjoyable. I enjoy breathing every day. But many people appreciate the joy of breathing only when they have asthma or a stuffed-up nose. We don’t need to wait until we have asthma to enjoy our breathing. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=947))\n- Awareness of the precious elements of happiness is itself the practice of right mindfulness. Elements like these are within us and all around us. In each second of our lives we can enjoy them. If we do so, seeds of peace, joy, and happiness will be planted in us, and they will become strong. The secret to happiness is happiness itself.

You look into the reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or our family, we blame the other person. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=955))\n- Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and arguments. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change. ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=958))\n- When you understand, you cannot help but love. You cannot get angry. To develop understanding, you have to practice looking at all living beings with the eyes of compassion. When you understand, you cannot help but love. And when you love, you naturally act in a way that can relieve the suffering of people. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=971))\n- When we are in contact with another’s suffering, a feeling of compassion is born in us. Compassion means, literally, “to suffer with.” ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=992))\n- We can also meditate on the suffering of those who cause us to suffer. Anyone who has made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need to follow our breathing and look deeply, and naturally we will see his suffering. A part of his difficulties and sorrows may have been brought about by his parents’ lack of skill when he was still young. But his parents themselves may have been victims of their parents; the suffering has been transmitted from generation to generation and been reborn in him. If we see that, we will no longer blame him for making us suffer, because we know that he is also a victim. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=1007))\n- So when you hug your child, your friend, your spouse, I recommend that you first breathe in and out consciously and return to the present moment. Then, while you hold him or her in your arms, breathe three times consciously, and you will enjoy your hugging more than ever before.

Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot be here either.

Doing so will help us maintain mindfulness of our good fortune, and perhaps one day we will find ways to do something to help change the system of injustice that exists in the world. ([Location 1259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=1259))\n- If we cannot smile, we cannot help other people smile.

([Location 1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=1273))\n- Meditation is to look deeply into things and to see how we can change ourselves and how we can transform our situation. To transform our situation is also to transform our minds. To transform our minds is also to transform our situation, because the situation is mind, and mind is situation. ([Location 1287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=1287))\n- During any conflict, we need people who can understand the suffering of all sides. For example, if a number of people in South Africa could go to each side and understand their suffering, and communicate that to the other sides, that would be very helpful. We need links. We need communication. Practicing nonviolence is first of all to become nonviolence. Then when a difficult situation presents itself, we will react in a way that will help the situation. This applies to problems of the family as well as to problems of society. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=1322))\n- “I am sorry, I hurt you out of my ignorance, out of my lack of mindfulness, out of my lack of skillfulness. I will try my best to change myself. I don’t dare to say anything more to you.” Sometimes, we do not have the intention to hurt, but because we are not mindful or skillful enough, we hurt someone. ([Location 1368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=1368))\n- The second thing to do is to try to bring out the best part in ourselves, the part of the flower, to transform ourselves. That is the only way to demonstrate what you have just said. When you have become fresh and pleasant, the other person will notice very soon. Then when there is a chance to approach that person, you can come to her as a flower and she will notice immediately that you are quite different. You may not have to say anything. Just seeing you like that, she will accept you and forgive you. That is called “speaking with your life and not just with words.” ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=1371))\n---\nauthor: [[Thich Nhat Hanh]]\ntitle: \"Peace Is Every Step\"\ntags: \n- books\n- literature-note\n---\n# Peace Is Every Step\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qSdpqKKaL._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Thich Nhat Hanh]]\n- Full Title: Peace Is Every Step\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- We are very good at preparing to live, but not very good at living. We know how to sacrifice ten years for a diploma, and we are willing to work very hard to get a job, a car, a house, and so on. But we have difficulty remembering that we are alive in the present moment, the only moment there is for us to be alive.

A tiny bud of a smile on our lips nourishes awareness and calms us miraculously. It returns to us the peace we thought we had lost. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=206))\n- Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile.

If we keep breathing in and out this way for a few minutes, we become quite refreshed. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=257))\n- Watching a bad TV program, we become the TV program. We are what we feel and perceive. If we are angry, we are the anger. If we are in love, we are love. If we look at a snow-covered mountain peak, we are the mountain.

The buzzer that goes off when you forget to fasten the seat belt in your car is a bell of mindfulness. Even non-sounds, such as the rays of sunlight coming through the window, are bells of mindfulness that can remind us to return to ourselves, breathe, smile, and live fully in the present moment.

I always went to the front yard and took my time eating it, sometimes half an hour or forty-five minutes for one cookie. I would take a small bite and look up at the sky. Then I would touch the dog with my feet and take another small bite. I just enjoyed being there, with the sky, the earth, the bamboo thickets, the cat, the dog, the flowers. I was able to do that because I did not have much to worry about. I did not think of the future, I did not regret the past. I was entirely in the present moment, with my cookie, the dog, the bamboo thickets, the cat, and everything. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=347))\n- Eating mindfully is a most important practice of meditation. We can eat in a way that we restore the cookie of our childhood. The present moment is filled with joy and happiness. If you are attentive, you will see it.

They saw not only their tangerine, but also its mother, the tangerine tree. With some guidance, they began to visualize the blossoms in the sunshine and in the rain. Then they saw petals falling down and the tiny green fruit appear. The sunshine and the rain continued, and the tiny tangerine grew. Now someone has picked it, and the tangerine is here. After seeing this, each child was invited to peel the tangerine slowly, noticing the mist and the fragrance of the tangerine, and then bring it up to his or her mouth and have a mindful bite, in full awareness of the texture and taste of the fruit and the juice coming out. We ate slowly like that. Each time you look at a tangerine, you can see deeply into it. You can see everything in the universe in one tangerine. When you peel it and smell it, it’s wonderful. You can take your time eating a tangerine and be very happy. ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=360))\n- In our daily lives, we may see the people around us, but if we lack mindfulness, they are just phantoms, not real people, and we ourselves are also ghosts. Practicing mindfulness enables us to become a real person. When we are a real person, we see real people around us, and life is present in all its richness. The practice of eating bread, a tangerine, or a cookie is the same.

We turn off the TV, put down our newspaper, and work together for five or ten minutes, setting the table and finishing whatever needs to be done. During these few minutes, we can be very happy. When the food is on the table and everyone is seated, we practice breathing: “Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile,” three times. We can recover ourselves completely after three breaths like this. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=380))\n- we look at each person as we breathe in and out in order to be in touch with ourselves and everyone at the table. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=383))\n- After breathing, we smile. Sitting at the table with other people, we have a chance to offer an authentic smile of friendship and understanding. It is very easy, but not many people do it. To me, this is the most important practice. We look at each person and smile at him or her. Breathing and smiling together is a very important practice. If the people in a household cannot smile at each other, the situation is very dangerous. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=386))\n- After breathing and smiling, we look down at the food in a way that allows the food to become real. This food reveals our connection with the earth. Each bite contains the life of the sun and the earth. The extent to which our food reveals itself depends on us. We can see and taste the whole universe in a piece of bread! Contemplating our food for a few seconds before eating, and eating in mindfulness, can bring us much happiness. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=389))\n- Having the opportunity to sit with our family and friends and enjoy wonderful food is something precious, something not everyone has.

Once you are standing in front of the sink with your sleeves rolled up and your hands in the warm water, it is really quite pleasant. I enjoy taking my time with each dish, being fully aware of the dish, the water, and each movement of my hands. I know that if I hurry in order to eat dessert sooner, the time of washing dishes will be unpleasant and not worth living. That would be a pity, for each minute, each second of life is a miracle.

We don’t like being so busy, but every time we have a spare moment, we are afraid of being alone with ourselves. We want to escape. Either we turn on the television, pick up the telephone, read a novel, go out with a friend, or take the car and go somewhere. Our civilization teaches us to act this way and provides us with many things we can use to lose touch with ourselves.

One smile, one breath, should be for the benefit of the whole day, not just for that moment. We must practice in a way that removes the barrier between practice and non-practice. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=510))\n- We should be able to bring the practice from the meditation hall into our daily lives. We need to discuss among ourselves how to do it. Do you practice breathing between phone calls? Do you practice smiling while cutting carrots? Do you practice relaxation after hours of hard work? These are practical questions. If you know how to apply meditation to dinner time, leisure time, sleeping time, it will penetrate your daily life, and it will also have a tremendous effect on social concerns. Mindfulness can penetrate the activities of everyday life, each minute, each hour of our daily life, and not just be a description of something far away. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=516))\n- The foundation of happiness is mindfulness.

([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=579))\n- Western civilization places so much emphasis on the idea of hope that we sacrifice the present moment. Hope is for the future. It cannot help us discover joy, peace, or enlightenment in the present moment. Many religions are based on the notion of hope, and this teaching about refraining from hope may create a strong reaction.

He did not say anything for quite a long time. The audience was perfectly silent. Everyone seemed to be thinking hard, trying to see the meaning behind the Buddha’s gesture. Then, suddenly, the Buddha smiled. He smiled because someone in the audience smiled at him and at the flower.

But it is more effective to return to our conscious breathing and just observe it, identifying it silently to ourselves: “Breathing in, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me. Breathing out, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me.” Calling a feeling by its name, such as “anger,” “sorrow,” “joy,” or “happiness,” helps us identify it clearly and recognize it more deeply.

([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=667))\n- Our attitude of not clinging to or rejecting our feelings is the attitude of letting go, an important part of meditation practice.

As soon as we understand the causes and nature of our feelings, they begin to transform themselves.

Breathing out, I know that I am my anger.” If we follow our breathing closely while we identify and mindfully observe our anger, it can no longer monopolize our consciousness.

Breathing out, I know that I must put all my energy into caring for my anger.” So we avoid thinking about the other person, and we refrain from doing or saying anything as long as our anger persists. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=734))\n- When we are angry, our anger is our very self. To suppress or chase it away is to suppress or chase away our self. When we are joyful, we are the joy. When we are angry, we are the anger. When anger is born in us, we can be aware that anger is an energy in us, and we can accept that energy in order to transform it into another kind of energy. When we have a compost bin filled with organic material which is decomposing and smelly, we know that we can transform the waste into beautiful flowers. At first, we may see the compost and the flowers as opposite, but when we look deeply, we see that the flowers already exist in the compost, and the compost already exists in the flowers.

Our conscious, reasoning mind knows that negative feelings such as anger, fear, and regret are not wholly acceptable to ourselves or society, so it finds ways to repress them, to push them into remote areas of our consciousness in order to forget them. Because we want to avoid suffering, we create defense mechanisms that deny the existence of these negative feelings and give us the impression we have peace within ourselves. But our internal formations are always looking for ways to manifest as destructive images, feelings, thoughts, words, or behavior. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=812))\n- When we live with another person, to protect each other’s happiness, we should help one another transform the internal formations that we produce together. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=837))\n- Happiness is no longer an individual matter. If the other person is not happy, we will not be happy either. To transform the other person’s knots will help bring about our own happiness as well. A wife can create internal formations in her husband, and a husband can do so in his wife, and if they continue to create knots in each other, one day there will be no happiness left. Therefore, as soon as a knot is created, the wife, for example, should know that a knot has just been tied in her. She should not overlook it.

If we want to live in peace and happiness with a person, we have to see the suchness of that person. Once we see it, we understand him or her, and there will be no trouble. We can live peacefully and happily together. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=848))\n- When we bring natural gas into our homes for heating and cooking, we know the suchness of gas. We know that gas is dangerous—it can kill us if we are not mindful. But we also know that we need the gas in order to cook, so we do not hesitate to bring it into our homes. The same is true of electricity. We could get electrocuted by it, but when we are mindful, it can help us, and there is no problem, because we know something about the suchness of electricity. A person is the same. If we do not know enough about the suchness of that person, we may get ourselves into trouble. But if we know, then we can enjoy each other very much and benefit a lot from one another. The key is knowing a person’s suchness. We do not expect a person always to be a flower. We have to understand his or her garbage as well.

They did not intend to make their children suffer. Maybe they received the same kind of seeds from their parents. There is a continuation in the transmission of seeds, and their father and mother might have gotten those seeds from their grandfather and grandmother. Most of us are victims of a kind of living that is not mindful, and the practice of mindful living, of meditation, can stop these kinds of suffering and end the transmission of such sorrow to our children and grandchildren. We can break the cycle by not allowing these kinds of seeds of suffering to be transmitted to our children, our friends, or anyone else.

They could not transform the suffering in themselves. But if we see them with compassionate eyes, we can offer them joy, peace, and forgiveness. In fact, when we look deeply, we discover that it is impossible to drop all identity with our parents.

If we are angry for five minutes, new seeds of anger are produced and deposited in the soil of our unconscious mind during those five minutes. That is why we have to be careful in selecting the kind of life we lead and the emotions we express. When I smile, the seeds of smiling and joy have come up. ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=903))\n- We often ask, “What’s wrong?” Doing so, we invite painful seeds of sorrow to come up and manifest. We feel suffering, anger, and depression, and produce more such seeds. We would be much happier if we tried to stay in touch with the healthy, joyful seeds inside of us and around us. We should learn to ask, “What’s not wrong?” and be in touch with that.

Our breathing, for example, can be very enjoyable. I enjoy breathing every day. But many people appreciate the joy of breathing only when they have asthma or a stuffed-up nose. We don’t need to wait until we have asthma to enjoy our breathing.

Elements like these are within us and all around us. In each second of our lives we can enjoy them. If we do so, seeds of peace, joy, and happiness will be planted in us, and they will become strong. The secret to happiness is happiness itself.

You look into the reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce.

To develop understanding, you have to practice looking at all living beings with the eyes of compassion. When you understand, you cannot help but love. And when you love, you naturally act in a way that can relieve the suffering of people.

Compassion means, literally, “to suffer with.” ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=992))\n- We can also meditate on the suffering of those who cause us to suffer. Anyone who has made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need to follow our breathing and look deeply, and naturally we will see his suffering. A part of his difficulties and sorrows may have been brought about by his parents’ lack of skill when he was still young. But his parents themselves may have been victims of their parents; the suffering has been transmitted from generation to generation and been reborn in him. If we see that, we will no longer blame him for making us suffer, because we know that he is also a victim.

To transform our situation is also to transform our minds. To transform our minds is also to transform our situation, because the situation is mind, and mind is situation.

For example, if a number of people in South Africa could go to each side and understand their suffering, and communicate that to the other sides, that would be very helpful. We need links. We need communication. Practicing nonviolence is first of all to become nonviolence. Then when a difficult situation presents itself, we will react in a way that will help the situation.

That is the only way to demonstrate what you have just said. When you have become fresh and pleasant, the other person will notice very soon. Then when there is a chance to approach that person, you can come to her as a flower and she will notice immediately that you are quite different. You may not have to say anything.

If we keep breathing in and out this way for a few minutes, we become quite refreshed.

The buzzer that goes off when you forget to fasten the seat belt in your car is a bell of mindfulness. Even non-sounds, such as the rays of sunlight coming through the window, are bells of mindfulness that can remind us to return to ourselves, breathe, smile, and live fully in the present moment.

I always went to the front yard and took my time eating it, sometimes half an hour or forty-five minutes for one cookie. I would take a small bite and look up at the sky. Then I would touch the dog with my feet and take another small bite. I just enjoyed being there, with the sky, the earth, the bamboo thickets, the cat, the dog, the flowers. I was able to do that because I did not have much to worry about. I did not think of the future, I did not regret the past. I was entirely in the present moment, with my cookie, the dog, the bamboo thickets, the cat, and everything. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=347))\n- Eating mindfully is a most important practice of meditation.

They saw not only their tangerine, but also its mother, the tangerine tree. With some guidance, they began to visualize the blossoms in the sunshine and in the rain. Then they saw petals falling down and the tiny green fruit appear. The sunshine and the rain continued, and the tiny tangerine grew. Now someone has picked it, and the tangerine is here. After seeing this, each child was invited to peel the tangerine slowly, noticing the mist and the fragrance of the tangerine, and then bring it up to his or her mouth and have a mindful bite, in full awareness of the texture and taste of the fruit and the juice coming out. We ate slowly like that. Each time you look at a tangerine, you can see deeply into it. You can see everything in the universe in one tangerine. When you peel it and smell it, it’s wonderful. You can take your time eating a tangerine and be very happy.

Practicing mindfulness enables us to become a real person. When we are a real person, we see real people around us, and life is present in all its richness. The practice of eating bread, a tangerine, or a cookie is the same.

We turn off the TV, put down our newspaper, and work together for five or ten minutes, setting the table and finishing whatever needs to be done. During these few minutes, we can be very happy. When the food is on the table and everyone is seated, we practice breathing: “Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile,” three times.

Sitting at the table with other people, we have a chance to offer an authentic smile of friendship and understanding. It is very easy, but not many people do it. To me, this is the most important practice. We look at each person and smile at him or her. Breathing and smiling together is a very important practice. If the people in a household cannot smile at each other, the situation is very dangerous. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=386))\n- After breathing and smiling, we look down at the food in a way that allows the food to become real. This food reveals our connection with the earth. Each bite contains the life of the sun and the earth. The extent to which our food reveals itself depends on us. We can see and taste the whole universe in a piece of bread! Contemplating our food for a few seconds before eating, and eating in mindfulness, can bring us much happiness.

Once you are standing in front of the sink with your sleeves rolled up and your hands in the warm water, it is really quite pleasant. I enjoy taking my time with each dish, being fully aware of the dish, the water, and each movement of my hands. I know that if I hurry in order to eat dessert sooner, the time of washing dishes will be unpleasant and not worth living. That would be a pity, for each minute, each second of life is a miracle.

We don’t like being so busy, but every time we have a spare moment, we are afraid of being alone with ourselves. We want to escape.

We need to discuss among ourselves how to do it. Do you practice breathing between phone calls? Do you practice smiling while cutting carrots? Do you practice relaxation after hours of hard work? These are practical questions. If you know how to apply meditation to dinner time, leisure time, sleeping time, it will penetrate your daily life, and it will also have a tremendous effect on social concerns. Mindfulness can penetrate the activities of everyday life, each minute, each hour of our daily life, and not just be a description of something far away.

Hope is for the future. It cannot help us discover joy, peace, or enlightenment in the present moment. Many religions are based on the notion of hope, and this teaching about refraining from hope may create a strong reaction.

He did not say anything for quite a long time. The audience was perfectly silent. Everyone seemed to be thinking hard, trying to see the meaning behind the Buddha’s gesture. Then, suddenly, the Buddha smiled. He smiled because someone in the audience smiled at him and at the flower.

But it is more effective to return to our conscious breathing and just observe it, identifying it silently to ourselves: “Breathing in, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me. Breathing out, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me.” Calling a feeling by its name, such as “anger,” “sorrow,” “joy,” or “happiness,” helps us identify it clearly and recognize it more deeply. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=662))\n- Mindful observation is based on the principle of “non-duality”: our feeling is not separate from us or caused merely by something outside us; our feeling is us, and for the moment we are that feeling. ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=667))\n- Our attitude of not clinging to or rejecting our feelings is the attitude of letting go, an important part of meditation practice. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=669))\n- A teacher has to give birth to the teacher within his student, and a psychotherapist has to give birth to the psychotherapist within his patient. The patient’s “internal psychotherapist” can then work full-time in a very effective way.

As soon as we understand the causes and nature of our feelings, they begin to transform themselves.

Breathing out, I know that I am my anger.” If we follow our breathing closely while we identify and mindfully observe our anger, it can no longer monopolize our consciousness. ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=725))\n- Like a fireman, we have to pour water on the blaze first and not waste time looking for the one who set the house on fire. “Breathing in, I know that I am angry. Breathing out, I know that I must put all my energy into caring for my anger.” So we avoid thinking about the other person, and we refrain from doing or saying anything as long as our anger persists. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=734))\n- When we are angry, our anger is our very self. To suppress or chase it away is to suppress or chase away our self. When we are joyful, we are the joy. When we are angry, we are the anger. When anger is born in us, we can be aware that anger is an energy in us, and we can accept that energy in order to transform it into another kind of energy. When we have a compost bin filled with organic material which is decomposing and smelly, we know that we can transform the waste into beautiful flowers. At first, we may see the compost and the flowers as opposite, but when we look deeply, we see that the flowers already exist in the compost, and the compost already exists in the flowers.

([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=767))\n- If we look into our anger, we can see its roots, such as misunderstanding, clumsiness, injustice, resentment, or conditioning.

Our conscious, reasoning mind knows that negative feelings such as anger, fear, and regret are not wholly acceptable to ourselves or society, so it finds ways to repress them, to push them into remote areas of our consciousness in order to forget them. Because we want to avoid suffering, we create defense mechanisms that deny the existence of these negative feelings and give us the impression we have peace within ourselves. But our internal formations are always looking for ways to manifest as destructive images, feelings, thoughts, words, or behavior. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=812))\n- When we live with another person, to protect each other’s happiness, we should help one another transform the internal formations that we produce together. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=837))\n- Happiness is no longer an individual matter. If the other person is not happy, we will not be happy either. To transform the other person’s knots will help bring about our own happiness as well. A wife can create internal formations in her husband, and a husband can do so in his wife, and if they continue to create knots in each other, one day there will be no happiness left. Therefore, as soon as a knot is created, the wife, for example, should know that a knot has just been tied in her. She should not overlook it. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=839))\n- In Buddhism, the word “suchness” is used to mean “the essence or particular characteristics of a thing or a person, its true nature.” Each person has his or her suchness. If we want to live in peace and happiness with a person, we have to see the suchness of that person. Once we see it, we understand him or her, and there will be no trouble. We can live peacefully and happily together. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=848))\n- When we bring natural gas into our homes for heating and cooking, we know the suchness of gas. We know that gas is dangerous—it can kill us if we are not mindful. But we also know that we need the gas in order to cook, so we do not hesitate to bring it into our homes. The same is true of electricity. We could get electrocuted by it, but when we are mindful, it can help us, and there is no problem, because we know something about the suchness of electricity. A person is the same. If we do not know enough about the suchness of that person, we may get ourselves into trouble. But if we know, then we can enjoy each other very much and benefit a lot from one another. The key is knowing a person’s suchness. We do not expect a person always to be a flower. We have to understand his or her garbage as well.

They did not intend to make their children suffer. Maybe they received the same kind of seeds from their parents. There is a continuation in the transmission of seeds, and their father and mother might have gotten those seeds from their grandfather and grandmother. Most of us are victims of a kind of living that is not mindful, and the practice of mindful living, of meditation, can stop these kinds of suffering and end the transmission of such sorrow to our children and grandchildren. We can break the cycle by not allowing these kinds of seeds of suffering to be transmitted to our children, our friends, or anyone else. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=871))\n- When we look at our parents with compassion, often we see that our parents are only victims who never had the chance to practice mindfulness. They could not transform the suffering in themselves. But if we see them with compassionate eyes, we can offer them joy, peace, and forgiveness. In fact, when we look deeply, we discover that it is impossible to drop all identity with our parents.

If we are angry for five minutes, new seeds of anger are produced and deposited in the soil of our unconscious mind during those five minutes. That is why we have to be careful in selecting the kind of life we lead and the emotions we express. When I smile, the seeds of smiling and joy have come up. ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=903))\n- We often ask, “What’s wrong?” Doing so, we invite painful seeds of sorrow to come up and manifest. We feel suffering, anger, and depression, and produce more such seeds. We would be much happier if we tried to stay in touch with the healthy, joyful seeds inside of us and around us. We should learn to ask, “What’s not wrong?” and be in touch with that.

Our breathing, for example, can be very enjoyable. I enjoy breathing every day. But many people appreciate the joy of breathing only when they have asthma or a stuffed-up nose. We don’t need to wait until we have asthma to enjoy our breathing. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=947))\n- Awareness of the precious elements of happiness is itself the practice of right mindfulness. Elements like these are within us and all around us. In each second of our lives we can enjoy them. If we do so, seeds of peace, joy, and happiness will be planted in us, and they will become strong. The secret to happiness is happiness itself.

You look into the reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or our family, we blame the other person. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=955))\n- Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and arguments. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change. ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=958))\n- When you understand, you cannot help but love. You cannot get angry. To develop understanding, you have to practice looking at all living beings with the eyes of compassion. When you understand, you cannot help but love. And when you love, you naturally act in a way that can relieve the suffering of people. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=971))\n- When we are in contact with another’s suffering, a feeling of compassion is born in us. Compassion means, literally, “to suffer with.” ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=992))\n- We can also meditate on the suffering of those who cause us to suffer. Anyone who has made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need to follow our breathing and look deeply, and naturally we will see his suffering. A part of his difficulties and sorrows may have been brought about by his parents’ lack of skill when he was still young. But his parents themselves may have been victims of their parents; the suffering has been transmitted from generation to generation and been reborn in him. If we see that, we will no longer blame him for making us suffer, because we know that he is also a victim.

To transform our situation is also to transform our minds. To transform our minds is also to transform our situation, because the situation is mind, and mind is situation.

For example, if a number of people in South Africa could go to each side and understand their suffering, and communicate that to the other sides, that would be very helpful. We need links. We need communication. Practicing nonviolence is first of all to become nonviolence. Then when a difficult situation presents itself, we will react in a way that will help the situation. This applies to problems of the family as well as to problems of society.

That is the only way to demonstrate what you have just said. When you have become fresh and pleasant, the other person will notice very soon. Then when there is a chance to approach that person, you can come to her as a flower and she will notice immediately that you are quite different. You may not have to say anything. Just seeing you like that, she will accept you and forgive you.

If we keep breathing in and out this way for a few minutes, we become quite refreshed.

The buzzer that goes off when you forget to fasten the seat belt in your car is a bell of mindfulness. Even non-sounds, such as the rays of sunlight coming through the window, are bells of mindfulness that can remind us to return to ourselves, breathe, smile, and live fully in the present moment.

I always went to the front yard and took my time eating it, sometimes half an hour or forty-five minutes for one cookie. I would take a small bite and look up at the sky. Then I would touch the dog with my feet and take another small bite. I just enjoyed being there, with the sky, the earth, the bamboo thickets, the cat, the dog, the flowers. I was able to do that because I did not have much to worry about. I did not think of the future, I did not regret the past. I was entirely in the present moment, with my cookie, the dog, the bamboo thickets, the cat, and everything. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=347))\n- Eating mindfully is a most important practice of meditation.

They saw not only their tangerine, but also its mother, the tangerine tree. With some guidance, they began to visualize the blossoms in the sunshine and in the rain. Then they saw petals falling down and the tiny green fruit appear. The sunshine and the rain continued, and the tiny tangerine grew. Now someone has picked it, and the tangerine is here. After seeing this, each child was invited to peel the tangerine slowly, noticing the mist and the fragrance of the tangerine, and then bring it up to his or her mouth and have a mindful bite, in full awareness of the texture and taste of the fruit and the juice coming out. We ate slowly like that. Each time you look at a tangerine, you can see deeply into it. You can see everything in the universe in one tangerine. When you peel it and smell it, it’s wonderful. You can take your time eating a tangerine and be very happy.

Practicing mindfulness enables us to become a real person. When we are a real person, we see real people around us, and life is present in all its richness. The practice of eating bread, a tangerine, or a cookie is the same.

We turn off the TV, put down our newspaper, and work together for five or ten minutes, setting the table and finishing whatever needs to be done. During these few minutes, we can be very happy. When the food is on the table and everyone is seated, we practice breathing: “Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile,” three times.

Sitting at the table with other people, we have a chance to offer an authentic smile of friendship and understanding. It is very easy, but not many people do it. To me, this is the most important practice. We look at each person and smile at him or her. Breathing and smiling together is a very important practice. If the people in a household cannot smile at each other, the situation is very dangerous. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=386))\n- After breathing and smiling, we look down at the food in a way that allows the food to become real. This food reveals our connection with the earth. Each bite contains the life of the sun and the earth. The extent to which our food reveals itself depends on us. We can see and taste the whole universe in a piece of bread! Contemplating our food for a few seconds before eating, and eating in mindfulness, can bring us much happiness.

Once you are standing in front of the sink with your sleeves rolled up and your hands in the warm water, it is really quite pleasant. I enjoy taking my time with each dish, being fully aware of the dish, the water, and each movement of my hands. I know that if I hurry in order to eat dessert sooner, the time of washing dishes will be unpleasant and not worth living. That would be a pity, for each minute, each second of life is a miracle.

We don’t like being so busy, but every time we have a spare moment, we are afraid of being alone with ourselves. We want to escape. Either we turn on the television, pick up the telephone, read a novel, go out with a friend, or take the car and go somewhere.

We need to discuss among ourselves how to do it. Do you practice breathing between phone calls? Do you practice smiling while cutting carrots? Do you practice relaxation after hours of hard work? These are practical questions. If you know how to apply meditation to dinner time, leisure time, sleeping time, it will penetrate your daily life, and it will also have a tremendous effect on social concerns. Mindfulness can penetrate the activities of everyday life, each minute, each hour of our daily life, and not just be a description of something far away.

But when we do not have a toothache, we are still not happy. A non-toothache is very pleasant. There are so many things that are enjoyable, but when we don’t practice mindfulness, we don’t appreciate them.

([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=579))\n- Western civilization places so much emphasis on the idea of hope that we sacrifice the present moment. Hope is for the future. It cannot help us discover joy, peace, or enlightenment in the present moment. Many religions are based on the notion of hope, and this teaching about refraining from hope may create a strong reaction.

He did not say anything for quite a long time. The audience was perfectly silent. Everyone seemed to be thinking hard, trying to see the meaning behind the Buddha’s gesture. Then, suddenly, the Buddha smiled. He smiled because someone in the audience smiled at him and at the flower.

But it is more effective to return to our conscious breathing and just observe it, identifying it silently to ourselves: “Breathing in, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me. Breathing out, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me.” Calling a feeling by its name, such as “anger,” “sorrow,” “joy,” or “happiness,” helps us identify it clearly and recognize it more deeply. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=662))\n- Mindful observation is based on the principle of “non-duality”: our feeling is not separate from us or caused merely by something outside us; our feeling is us, and for the moment we are that feeling. ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=667))\n- Our attitude of not clinging to or rejecting our feelings is the attitude of letting go, an important part of meditation practice.

As soon as we understand the causes and nature of our feelings, they begin to transform themselves.

Breathing out, I know that I am my anger.” If we follow our breathing closely while we identify and mindfully observe our anger, it can no longer monopolize our consciousness. ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=725))\n- Like a fireman, we have to pour water on the blaze first and not waste time looking for the one who set the house on fire. “Breathing in, I know that I am angry. Breathing out, I know that I must put all my energy into caring for my anger.” So we avoid thinking about the other person, and we refrain from doing or saying anything as long as our anger persists.

To suppress or chase it away is to suppress or chase away our self. When we are joyful, we are the joy. When we are angry, we are the anger. When anger is born in us, we can be aware that anger is an energy in us, and we can accept that energy in order to transform it into another kind of energy. When we have a compost bin filled with organic material which is decomposing and smelly, we know that we can transform the waste into beautiful flowers. At first, we may see the compost and the flowers as opposite, but when we look deeply, we see that the flowers already exist in the compost, and the compost already exists in the flowers.

Our conscious, reasoning mind knows that negative feelings such as anger, fear, and regret are not wholly acceptable to ourselves or society, so it finds ways to repress them, to push them into remote areas of our consciousness in order to forget them. Because we want to avoid suffering, we create defense mechanisms that deny the existence of these negative feelings and give us the impression we have peace within ourselves. But our internal formations are always looking for ways to manifest as destructive images, feelings, thoughts, words, or behavior.

([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=837))\n- Happiness is no longer an individual matter. If the other person is not happy, we will not be happy either. To transform the other person’s knots will help bring about our own happiness as well. A wife can create internal formations in her husband, and a husband can do so in his wife, and if they continue to create knots in each other, one day there will be no happiness left. Therefore, as soon as a knot is created, the wife, for example, should know that a knot has just been tied in her. She should not overlook it.

If we want to live in peace and happiness with a person, we have to see the suchness of that person. Once we see it, we understand him or her, and there will be no trouble. We can live peacefully and happily together.

We know that gas is dangerous—it can kill us if we are not mindful. But we also know that we need the gas in order to cook, so we do not hesitate to bring it into our homes. The same is true of electricity. We could get electrocuted by it, but when we are mindful, it can help us, and there is no problem, because we know something about the suchness of electricity. A person is the same. If we do not know enough about the suchness of that person, we may get ourselves into trouble. But if we know, then we can enjoy each other very much and benefit a lot from one another. The key is knowing a person’s suchness. We do not expect a person always to be a flower. We have to understand his or her garbage as well.

They did not intend to make their children suffer. Maybe they received the same kind of seeds from their parents. There is a continuation in the transmission of seeds, and their father and mother might have gotten those seeds from their grandfather and grandmother. Most of us are victims of a kind of living that is not mindful, and the practice of mindful living, of meditation, can stop these kinds of suffering and end the transmission of such sorrow to our children and grandchildren. We can break the cycle by not allowing these kinds of seeds of suffering to be transmitted to our children, our friends, or anyone else.

If we are angry for five minutes, new seeds of anger are produced and deposited in the soil of our unconscious mind during those five minutes. That is why we have to be careful in selecting the kind of life we lead and the emotions we express. When I smile, the seeds of smiling and joy have come up.

We feel suffering, anger, and depression, and produce more such seeds. We would be much happier if we tried to stay in touch with the healthy, joyful seeds inside of us and around us. We should learn to ask, “What’s not wrong?” and be in touch with that.

Anyone who has made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need to follow our breathing and look deeply, and naturally we will see his suffering. A part of his difficulties and sorrows may have been brought about by his parents’ lack of skill when he was still young. But his parents themselves may have been victims of their parents; the suffering has been transmitted from generation to generation and been reborn in him.

Si hay un problema también hay una solución\n\nEl libro comienza con la historia de Alejandro Magno enfrentándose a cómo tomar una fortaleza enclavada entre dos altos picos totalmente inexpugnable.\n\nLa historia cuenta que se reúne al equipo de sabios de distintos perfiles (team problem solving) y reformulan el problema. Lo reenfocan diciendo que el problema es cómo ganar una posición ventajosa en altura en los picos más elevados. Lo resuelven inventando la escalada en cordada y haciendo que suban arqueros que matan a los guardas y el gobernador rinde la fortaleza.\n\nPasos que toman:\n- Definen el contexto de la situación\n- Identificar soluciones fallidas\n- Imaginar escenario ideal de éxito \u003e Redefinen el problema. De conquistar la fortaleza a conquistar la cima\n- Definido el problema de llegar a la cima inventan solución\n- Para ello parten de la solución ideal y fraccionan el problema en subclases que van resolviendo hasta crear solución total.\n\nLa lógica estratégica desarrolla modelos de intervención basados en el objetivo a alcanzar de manera sistemática, no son destellos de un genio.\n\n# 2. Qué es el problem solving\n\nKarl Popper y el proceso de investigación científica:\n1. Surge un problema\n2. Se estudian intentos de solución que se han llevado a cabo\n3. Se buscan soluciones alternativas\n4. Se aplican\n5. Se evalúan efectos\n6. Se ajusta estrategia hasta hacerla eficaz\n\nEl problema solving es la tecnología para encontrar soluciones mientras que la ciencia busca dar explicaciones a los fenómenos que estudia. Es por tanto un saber operativo (como el conocimiento lógico o el tecnologíco) vs el saber especulativo (filosófico o el científico).\n\nEl problem solver debe usar el conocimiento lógico tecnología operativo para sus intervenciones aunque obviamente éstos se retroalimentan con el filosófico/científico.\n\n\u003e Ante un problema tendemos a buscar la explicación más que la solución.\n\nLa solución no tiene necesidad de la explicación previa del problema. Necesario orientarse a la solución problema presente en lugar de buscar la explicación en el pasado.\n\nEl estudio de las causas pasadas es contraproducente para la búsqueda de soluciones presentes. Se refiere a no perderse en los porqué y entender cómo funciona.\n\n# Cómo funciona el problem solving estratégico?\n\n## Definir el problema.\n\nMediante el uso de las 5 preguntas. En qué consiste, quién está implicado, dónde se produce, cuando y cómo funciona.\n\nBuscar distintas perspectivas para definirlo para evitar caer en los sesgos propios. \n\nPara descubrir la solución es necesaria la redefinición repetitiva de las carácteristicas del problema. Otra forma de entender esta fase es buscar un reductor de la complejidad, redefinir el problema como hizo Alejandro Magno.\n\n## Determinar y acordar el objetivo\n\nConcretar un objetivo con los clientes para que la intervención pueda evaluarse como exitosa.\n\nEn caso de hacerlo en equipo sirve para hacer copartícipes del proyecto y hacer team building.\n\n##  Evaluar las soluciones intentadas\n\nIdentificación y evaluación de los intentos fallidos nos libera de la tendencia de buscar soluciones sin haber investigado lo que no funciona. Este análisis nos puede mostrar que dinámicas perpetúan y mantienen el problema y cuáles lo pueden cambiar. Es decir permiten conocer el funcionamiento del problema.\n\nEvaluar las estrategias intentadas supone:\n- Identificar lo que no funciona\n- Identificar lo que funciona\n\n\nSi lo que funciona es reproducible ya tendremos una solución. Sin embargo es habitual que soluciones pasadas no funcionen en el presente. \n\n## La técnica del cómo empeorar\n\nResulta de responder: `si quisiera empeorar la situación cómo lo haría?` La mente al evaluar las soluciones fallidas busca, por contraste, soluciones alternativas. Es paradójico, pero esta estrategia desbloquea la creatividad al bloquear la atención racional en la generación de soluciones para fallar.\n\n## La técnica del escenario más allá del prroblema \nconsiste en identificar todas las características de cómo sería la situación si la estrategia de resolución hubiese funcionado. Nos permite ver cosas que desde el presente nos cuestan más.\n\n\n\n## La táctica de los pequeños pasos\n\nTodo gran viaje comienza por un primer paso. Empezar por un pequeño cambio inicia un movimiento que además evita la resistencia al cambio que existe en cualquier sistema que está en un equilibrio desde hace tiempo. \n\n## La técnica del escalador\nSe parte de la cima de la montaña y se establecen las rutas hasta la base. De esa forma te aseguras no desviarte del objetivo.\n\nSe parte del objetivo final y se pasa al estadio anterior y así hasta el punto de partida. Se fracciona el objetivo en microobjetivos. Se parte del cambio más pequeño y concreto posible.\n\n\n`la enseñanza como una forma velada de introducción al cambio, especialmente útil cuando se trabaja con un grupo de personas de una misma organización pero que tienen ideas diferentes.`\n\n## Corregir el tiro progresivamente\n\nHay problema complejos que requieren soluciones sucesivas. En estos casos hay que empezar por el problema más accesible, luego continuar por el siguiente, etc. \n\nEs importante mantener visión global y las interrelaciones. \n\n![[IMG_20220410_231549.jpg]]\n\n# Arte o tecnología\nTrata sobre la estratagema, ambivalencia o lógica no ordinaria.

Once we see clearly what’s going on in the moment, we can then choose whether and how to act on what we’re seeing. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=260))\n- whatever gets our attention flourishes, so if we lavish attention on the negative and inconsequential, they can overwhelm the positive and the meaningful. But if we do the opposite, refusing to deal with or acknowledge what’s difficult and painful, pretending it doesn’t exist, then our world is out of whack. Whatever doesn’t get our attention withers—or retreats below conscious awareness, where it may still affect our lives. In a perverse way, ignoring the painful and the difficult is just another way of feeding the wolf. Meditation teaches us to open our attention to all of human experience and all parts of ourselves.

Parts of that mental soundtrack may be old tapes that were instilled in childhood and have been playing so long we’ve nearly tuned them out of conscious awareness. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=287))\n- Meditation teaches us to focus and to pay clear attention to our experiences and responses as they arise, and to observe them without judging them. That allows us to detect harmful habits of mind that were previously invisible to us.

You then return to focusing on your breathing. In this way meditation trains us to stay in the moment before us instead of reliving the past or worrying about the future. And it teaches us how to be gentle with ourselves and others, to forgive our lapses and move ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=310))\n- But if we apply mindfulness to the experience of anger, we can safely draw close to the emotion instead of fleeing, and investigate it instead of stonewalling. We notice it without judging it. We can gather more information about what happens when we get mad—what sets off the anger, where it lodges in the body, and what else it also contains, like sadness, fear, or regret. This pause for nonjudgmental acknowledgment creates a bit of peaceful space within which we can make new, different choices about how to respond to something like anger.

It helps us to stop beating up on ourselves for having perfectly human emotions. It frees energy we expend on trying to control the uncontrollable.

Most of us have a mixed, often paradoxical attitude toward change. Some of us don’t think change is possible at all; we believe we’re stuck forever doing things the way we’ve always done them. Some of us simultaneously hope for change and fear it. We want to believe that change is possible, because that means that our lives can get better. But we also have trouble accepting change, because we want to hold on permanently to what’s pleasurable and positive. We’d like difficulties to be fleeting and comfort to stick around.

Meditation helps us comprehend this fact—perhaps the basic truth of human existence, and the one we humans are most likely to balk at or be oblivious to, especially when it comes to the biggest change of all: Mortality happens, whether we like it or not. We grow old and die.

Breathing, discovering you’ve been distracted, and starting over: simple and manageable. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=694))\n- Some of these thoughts and feelings may be fascinating and delightful; some may make you uncomfortable; some may be deadly dull. You’ll practice letting them all go, without taking the time to judge them. This is a crucial first step in learning how to be more centered and present. ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=696))\n- Everyone who meditates, beginners and longer-term practitioners alike, gets hijacked at times by thoughts and feelings; it’s impossible not to be. But once you see how doable it is to start over, you won’t judge your efforts so harshly. And you’ll learn that starting over and not fruitlessly berating yourself are skills you can bring into your everyday life when you’ve made a mistake or lost sight of your aspirations. You can begin again. ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=700))\n- This act of beginning again is the essential art of the meditation practice.

We move on to the next thing because we aren’t really taking in what we already have; inattention creates an escalating need for stimulation. When we’re keenly aware of what’s happening, we don’t need to grasp for the next great moment of sensation or taste or sound (all the while missing what’s actually here, right in front of us). Nor do we need to postpone our feeling of happiness until a more exciting or more pleasing object comes along, ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=907))\n- His life is a pursuit of a pursuit forever.

If you do so paying very little attention to the sight of it, the feel, the smell and the taste, then eating the apple isn’t likely to be a fulfilling experience. Becoming aware of a mild discontent, you’re likely to blame the apple for being boring and commonplace. It’s easy to miss the fact that the quality of your attention played a major role in your dissatisfaction. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=920))\n- Learning to deepen our concentration allows us to look at the world with quiet eyes. We don’t need to reach out and grab ever more exotic or forbidden fruit. We develop calm and tranquility—and the calmer we get, the more at home we feel with our body and mind, with life as it is. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=938))\n- The point of meditation is not to annihilate thoughts; obviously there are plenty of times in life when thinking is called for—vital, in fact, to our survival. What we hope to learn is the difference between thinking and being lost in thought. We don’t want to stop our thoughts but to change our relationship with them—to be more present and aware when we’re thinking. If we’re aware of what we’re thinking, if we see clearly what’s going on in our minds, then we can choose whether and how to act on our thoughts. ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=973))\n- Thoughts moving through your mind are like clouds moving across the sky. They are not the sky, and the sky remains unchanged by them. The way to be with them is just to watch them go by. That’s not generally how we experience our thoughts, but that’s what you’re working toward. ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=981))\n- Meditation is a microcosm, a model, and a mirror. The skills we practice when we sit are transferable to the rest of our lives. In Week One we used the tool of concentration to steady and focus the mind. Following the breath, we became aware of thoughts, feelings, and sensations. We noted them and let them go without getting swept away by them, without dodging them or ignoring them (as we might normally have done in our busy daily lives), and without berating ourselves for having them. ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1076))\n- DEVELOPING OUR CONCENTRATION helps us steady our attention. The next skill we’ll develop, mindfulness, helps us to free our attention from burdens we may not even know we’re hauling around. ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1122))\n- How many times has an attempt to dodge pain made us miss the sweet parts of bittersweet—the chance to grow in response to a challenge, to help others or accept help from others? How many pleasures escape our notice because we think we need big, dramatic sensations to feel alive? Mindfulness can allow us to experience fully the moment in front of us—what Thoreau calls “the bloom of the present”—and to wake up from neutral so we don’t miss the small, rich moments that add up to a dimensional life. ([Location 1401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1401))\n- Mindfulness isn’t difficult; we just need to remember to do it. ([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1466))\n- Often people think, I don’t have the right kind of mindfulness, the right level of concentration. Progress is not about levels; it’s about frequency. If we can remember to be mindful, if we can add more moments of mindfulness, that makes all the difference. Countless times a day we lose mindfulness and become lost in reaction or disconnected from what is happening. But the moment we recognize that we’ve lost mindfulness, we have already regained it; that recognition is its essence. We can begin again.

Sylvia Boorstein, a writer and teacher, calls it “awake attention to what is happening inside and outside so we can respond from a place of wisdom.” The Vietnamese Zen teacher and poet Thich Nhat Hanh says, “I like to define mindfulness as the energy that helps us to be there one hundred percent; the energy of our true presence.” ([Location 1479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1479))\n- core group of unhealthy human tendencies that are obstacles to happiness. They’re the states of mind that distract us in meditation practice, and trip us up in the rest of our lives. Broadly speaking, they are: desire, aversion, sloth, restlessness, and doubt. ([Location 1551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1551))\n- You may recognize that the thoughts and emotions that come up in this week’s meditations are part of recurring patterns—that you’re hearing a lot of what I call old tapes, the familiar, habitual mental soundtrack I mentioned in the introduction. It’s helpful to acknowledge these tapes of ours, perhaps even to good-naturedly name them: Oh, ([Location 1752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1752))\n- During the meditation about a difficult situation, as I pictured that day, I realized how familiar that ‘one false move and I’m doomed’ feeling is. I don’t know yet why I play that tape—but at least now I know it happens.” ([Location 1765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1765))\n- The fourth-century Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu told this story: There was a man so displeased by the sight of his own shadow and footsteps that he determined to get rid of both by running away from them. But every time he put down his foot, there was another step, and his shadow kept up with him without the slightest difficulty. He thought he must not be running fast enough. So he ran faster and faster and faster, without stopping, until he finally dropped dead of exhaustion. He failed to realize that if he merely stepped into the shade, his shadow would vanish, and if he sat down and stayed still, there would be no more footsteps. ([Location 1777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1777))\n- Practicing mindfulness meditation is making the choice to be still—to step into the quiet shade instead of running away from difficult thoughts and feelings. We sometimes call meditation non-doing. Instead of being swept away by our usual conditioned reactions, we’re quiet and watchful, fully present with what is, touching it deeply, being touched by it, and seeing what is happening in the simplest and most direct fashion possible. ([Location 1782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1782))\n- And being mindful of the moment doesn’t mean that we give up savoring memories or setting goals. I like to quote Thich Nhat Hanh: “To dwell in the here and now does not mean you never think about the past or responsibly plan for the future,” he says. “The idea is simply not to allow yourself to get lost in regrets about the past or worries about the future. If you are firmly grounded in the present moment, the past can be an object of inquiry, the object of your mindfulness and concentration. You can attain many insights by looking into the past. But you are still grounded in the present moment.” ([Location 1880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1880))\n- When we know our thoughts, we neither dodge them nor get lost in them. Instead, we can decide when and if we should act on them; we can better discern which actions will lead to happiness and which to suffering. Meditation allows us to see and accept ourselves as we are in the moment—sometimes hot-tempered and sometimes mellow, sometimes cowardly and sometimes strong, sometimes ashamed and sometimes proud, sometimes confused and sometimes clear. ([Location 1947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1947))\n- The customary phrases are usually variations on May I Be Safe (or May I Be Free from Danger), May I Be Happy, May I Be Healthy, May I Live with Ease—may daily life not be a struggle.

If we’re in the habit of ignoring the humanity of strangers or people we don’t know well, we can experiment with being open and aware, taking an interest, connecting. If we’re in the habit of not really listening while conversing, we can experiment with being more fully present with the next person we speak to. If we’re in the habit of classifying and dismissing people based on what we think we know about them, we can experiment with listening with fresh ears, giving our full attention. If we’re wholehearted, open, interested, we may find that people surprise us.

But if we do the opposite, refusing to deal with or acknowledge what’s difficult and painful, pretending it doesn’t exist, then our world is out of whack. Whatever doesn’t get our attention withers—or retreats below conscious awareness, where it may still affect our lives. In a perverse way, ignoring the painful and the difficult is just another way of feeding the wolf. Meditation teaches us to open our attention to all of human experience and all parts of ourselves.

Parts of that mental soundtrack may be old tapes that were instilled in childhood and have been playing so long we’ve nearly tuned them out of conscious awareness. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=287))\n- Meditation teaches us to focus and to pay clear attention to our experiences and responses as they arise, and to observe them without judging them.

([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=306))\n- The practice entails paying attention to each in-and-out breath, and when your mind wanders (it will, that’s natural), noticing whatever has captured your attention, then letting go of the thought or feeling without berating yourself for it. You then return to focusing on your breathing. In this way meditation trains us to stay in the moment before us instead of reliving the past or worrying about the future. And it teaches us how to be gentle with ourselves and others, to forgive our lapses and move ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=310))\n- But if we apply mindfulness to the experience of anger, we can safely draw close to the emotion instead of fleeing, and investigate it instead of stonewalling. We notice it without judging it. We can gather more information about what happens when we get mad—what sets off the anger, where it lodges in the body, and what else it also contains, like sadness, fear, or regret. This pause for nonjudgmental acknowledgment creates a bit of peaceful space within which we can make new, different choices about how to respond to something like anger. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=324))\n- Mindfulness helps us get better at seeing the difference between what’s happening and the stories we tell ourselves about what’s happening, stories that get in the way of direct experience.

Meditation helps us comprehend this fact—perhaps the basic truth of human existence, and the one we humans are most likely to balk at or be oblivious to, especially when it comes to the biggest change of all: Mortality happens, whether we like it or not. We grow old and die. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=458))\n- Following our breath while observing how thoughts continually ebb and flow can help us realize that all elements of our experience are in constant flux. During a meditation session, you’ll find it’s natural to go through many ups and downs, to encounter both new delights and newly awakened conflicts that have bubbled up from the unconscious mind. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=464))\n- We can’t control what thoughts and emotions arise within us, nor can we control the universal truth that everything changes. But we can learn to step back and rest in the awareness of what’s happening. That awareness can be our refuge.

([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=637))\n- Thoughts and feelings will inevitably arise and claim your attention, but you’ll practice repeatedly noticing and letting go of these distractions, then returning your awareness to the in and out of your breath. Breathing, discovering you’ve been distracted, and starting over: simple and manageable. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=694))\n- Some of these thoughts and feelings may be fascinating and delightful; some may make you uncomfortable; some may be deadly dull. You’ll practice letting them all go, without taking the time to judge them. This is a crucial first step in learning how to be more centered and present. ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=696))\n- Everyone who meditates, beginners and longer-term practitioners alike, gets hijacked at times by thoughts and feelings; it’s impossible not to be. But once you see how doable it is to start over, you won’t judge your efforts so harshly. And you’ll learn that starting over and not fruitlessly berating yourself are skills you can bring into your everyday life when you’ve made a mistake or lost sight of your aspirations. You can begin again. ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=700))\n- This act of beginning again is the essential art of the meditation practice.

([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=899))\n- Not paying attention keeps us in an endless cycle of wanting. We move on to the next thing because we aren’t really taking in what we already have; inattention creates an escalating need for stimulation. When we’re keenly aware of what’s happening, we don’t need to grasp for the next great moment of sensation or taste or sound (all the while missing what’s actually here, right in front of us). Nor do we need to postpone our feeling of happiness until a more exciting or more pleasing object comes along, ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=907))\n- His life is a pursuit of a pursuit forever.

If you do so paying very little attention to the sight of it, the feel, the smell and the taste, then eating the apple isn’t likely to be a fulfilling experience. Becoming aware of a mild discontent, you’re likely to blame the apple for being boring and commonplace. It’s easy to miss the fact that the quality of your attention played a major role in your dissatisfaction. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=920))\n- Learning to deepen our concentration allows us to look at the world with quiet eyes. We don’t need to reach out and grab ever more exotic or forbidden fruit. We develop calm and tranquility—and the calmer we get, the more at home we feel with our body and mind, with life as it is. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=938))\n- The point of meditation is not to annihilate thoughts; obviously there are plenty of times in life when thinking is called for—vital, in fact, to our survival. What we hope to learn is the difference between thinking and being lost in thought. We don’t want to stop our thoughts but to change our relationship with them—to be more present and aware when we’re thinking. If we’re aware of what we’re thinking, if we see clearly what’s going on in our minds, then we can choose whether and how to act on our thoughts. ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=973))\n- Thoughts moving through your mind are like clouds moving across the sky. They are not the sky, and the sky remains unchanged by them. The way to be with them is just to watch them go by. That’s not generally how we experience our thoughts, but that’s what you’re working toward. ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=981))\n- Meditation is a microcosm, a model, and a mirror. The skills we practice when we sit are transferable to the rest of our lives. In Week One we used the tool of concentration to steady and focus the mind. Following the breath, we became aware of thoughts, feelings, and sensations. We noted them and let them go without getting swept away by them, without dodging them or ignoring them (as we might normally have done in our busy daily lives), and without berating ourselves for having them. ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1076))\n- DEVELOPING OUR CONCENTRATION helps us steady our attention. The next skill we’ll develop, mindfulness, helps us to free our attention from burdens we may not even know we’re hauling around. ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1122))\n- How many times has an attempt to dodge pain made us miss the sweet parts of bittersweet—the chance to grow in response to a challenge, to help others or accept help from others? How many pleasures escape our notice because we think we need big, dramatic sensations to feel alive? Mindfulness can allow us to experience fully the moment in front of us—what Thoreau calls “the bloom of the present”—and to wake up from neutral so we don’t miss the small, rich moments that add up to a dimensional life. ([Location 1401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1401))\n- Mindfulness isn’t difficult; we just need to remember to do it. ([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1466))\n- Often people think, I don’t have the right kind of mindfulness, the right level of concentration. Progress is not about levels; it’s about frequency. If we can remember to be mindful, if we can add more moments of mindfulness, that makes all the difference. Countless times a day we lose mindfulness and become lost in reaction or disconnected from what is happening. But the moment we recognize that we’ve lost mindfulness, we have already regained it; that recognition is its essence. We can begin again. ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1472))\n- I’VE HEARD SOME WONDERFUL EXPLANATIONS of mindfulness. Sylvia Boorstein, a writer and teacher, calls it “awake attention to what is happening inside and outside so we can respond from a place of wisdom.” The Vietnamese Zen teacher and poet Thich Nhat Hanh says, “I like to define mindfulness as the energy that helps us to be there one hundred percent; the energy of our true presence.” ([Location 1479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1479))\n- core group of unhealthy human tendencies that are obstacles to happiness. They’re the states of mind that distract us in meditation practice, and trip us up in the rest of our lives. Broadly speaking, they are: desire, aversion, sloth, restlessness, and doubt. ([Location 1551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1551))\n- You may recognize that the thoughts and emotions that come up in this week’s meditations are part of recurring patterns—that you’re hearing a lot of what I call old tapes, the familiar, habitual mental soundtrack I mentioned in the introduction. It’s helpful to acknowledge these tapes of ours, perhaps even to good-naturedly name them: Oh, ([Location 1752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1752))\n- During the meditation about a difficult situation, as I pictured that day, I realized how familiar that ‘one false move and I’m doomed’ feeling is. I don’t know yet why I play that tape—but at least now I know it happens.” ([Location 1765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1765))\n- The fourth-century Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu told this story: There was a man so displeased by the sight of his own shadow and footsteps that he determined to get rid of both by running away from them. But every time he put down his foot, there was another step, and his shadow kept up with him without the slightest difficulty. He thought he must not be running fast enough. So he ran faster and faster and faster, without stopping, until he finally dropped dead of exhaustion. He failed to realize that if he merely stepped into the shade, his shadow would vanish, and if he sat down and stayed still, there would be no more footsteps. ([Location 1777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1777))\n- Practicing mindfulness meditation is making the choice to be still—to step into the quiet shade instead of running away from difficult thoughts and feelings. We sometimes call meditation non-doing. Instead of being swept away by our usual conditioned reactions, we’re quiet and watchful, fully present with what is, touching it deeply, being touched by it, and seeing what is happening in the simplest and most direct fashion possible. ([Location 1782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1782))\n- And being mindful of the moment doesn’t mean that we give up savoring memories or setting goals. I like to quote Thich Nhat Hanh: “To dwell in the here and now does not mean you never think about the past or responsibly plan for the future,” he says. “The idea is simply not to allow yourself to get lost in regrets about the past or worries about the future. If you are firmly grounded in the present moment, the past can be an object of inquiry, the object of your mindfulness and concentration. You can attain many insights by looking into the past. But you are still grounded in the present moment.” ([Location 1880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1880))\n- When we know our thoughts, we neither dodge them nor get lost in them. Instead, we can decide when and if we should act on them; we can better discern which actions will lead to happiness and which to suffering. Meditation allows us to see and accept ourselves as we are in the moment—sometimes hot-tempered and sometimes mellow, sometimes cowardly and sometimes strong, sometimes ashamed and sometimes proud, sometimes confused and sometimes clear. ([Location 1947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1947))\n- The customary phrases are usually variations on May I Be Safe (or May I Be Free from Danger), May I Be Happy, May I Be Healthy, May I Live with Ease—may daily life not be a struggle.

If we’re in the habit of ignoring the humanity of strangers or people we don’t know well, we can experiment with being open and aware, taking an interest, connecting. If we’re in the habit of not really listening while conversing, we can experiment with being more fully present with the next person we speak to. If we’re in the habit of classifying and dismissing people based on what we think we know about them, we can experiment with listening with fresh ears, giving our full attention. If we’re wholehearted, open, interested, we may find that people surprise us.

Once we see clearly what’s going on in the moment, we can then choose whether and how to act on what we’re seeing. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=260))\n- whatever gets our attention flourishes, so if we lavish attention on the negative and inconsequential, they can overwhelm the positive and the meaningful. But if we do the opposite, refusing to deal with or acknowledge what’s difficult and painful, pretending it doesn’t exist, then our world is out of whack. Whatever doesn’t get our attention withers—or retreats below conscious awareness, where it may still affect our lives. In a perverse way, ignoring the painful and the difficult is just another way of feeding the wolf. Meditation teaches us to open our attention to all of human experience and all parts of ourselves. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=282))\n- the feeling of having your attention fractured by job and family, the enticement of electronic diversions, or the chatter of your mind—that morning’s spat with your mate replaying in your head, a litany of worries about the future or regrets about the past, a nervous endless-loop recitation of the day’s to-do list. Parts of that mental soundtrack may be old tapes that were instilled in childhood and have been playing so long we’ve nearly tuned them out of conscious awareness. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=287))\n- Meditation teaches us to focus and to pay clear attention to our experiences and responses as they arise, and to observe them without judging them. That allows us to detect harmful habits of mind that were previously invisible to us. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=300))\n- All forms of meditation strengthen and direct our attention through the cultivation of three key skills—concentration, mindfulness, and compassion or lovingkindness. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=306))\n- The practice entails paying attention to each in-and-out breath, and when your mind wanders (it will, that’s natural), noticing whatever has captured your attention, then letting go of the thought or feeling without berating yourself for it. You then return to focusing on your breathing. In this way meditation trains us to stay in the moment before us instead of reliving the past or worrying about the future. And it teaches us how to be gentle with ourselves and others, to forgive our lapses and move ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=310))\n- But if we apply mindfulness to the experience of anger, we can safely draw close to the emotion instead of fleeing, and investigate it instead of stonewalling. We notice it without judging it. We can gather more information about what happens when we get mad—what sets off the anger, where it lodges in the body, and what else it also contains, like sadness, fear, or regret. This pause for nonjudgmental acknowledgment creates a bit of peaceful space within which we can make new, different choices about how to respond to something like anger. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=324))\n- Mindfulness helps us get better at seeing the difference between what’s happening and the stories we tell ourselves about what’s happening, stories that get in the way of direct experience.

These assumptions we make about who we are and the way the world works—what we deserve, how much we can handle, where happiness is to be found, whether or not positive change is possible—all greatly influence how and to what we pay attention. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=398))\n- Assumptions block direct experience and prevent us from gathering information that could bring us comfort and relief, or information that, though saddening and painful, will allow us to make better decisions.

When we practice meditation, we often begin to recognize a specific sort of conditioned response—previously undetected restrictions we’ve imposed on our lives. We spot the ways we sabotage our own growth and success because we’ve been conditioned to be content with meager results. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=414))\n- You’ll weather hard times better. Meditation teaches us safe ways to open ourselves to the full range of experience—painful, pleasurable, and neutral—so we can learn how to be a friend to ourselves in good times and bad. During meditation sessions we practice being with difficult emotions and thoughts, even frightening or intense ones, in an open and accepting way, without adding self-criticism to something that already hurts. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=421))\n- You’ll rediscover a deeper sense of what’s really important to you.

Meditation practice cultivates qualities such as kindness, trust, and wisdom that you may think are missing from your makeup but are actually just undeveloped or obscured by stress and distractions. You’ll have the chance to access these qualities more easily and frequently.

But we can learn through meditation to change our responses to them. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=447))\n- Recognizing what we can’t control (the feelings that arise within us; other people; the weather) helps us have healthier boundaries at work and at home—no more trying to reform everyone all the time. It helps us to stop beating up on ourselves for having perfectly human emotions. It frees energy we expend on trying to control the uncontrollable. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=449))\n- You’ll understand how to relate to change better—to accept that it’s inevitable and believe that it’s possible. Most of us have a mixed, often paradoxical attitude toward change. Some of us don’t think change is possible at all; we believe we’re stuck forever doing things the way we’ve always done them. Some of us simultaneously hope for change and fear it. We want to believe that change is possible, because that means that our lives can get better. But we also have trouble accepting change, because we want to hold on permanently to what’s pleasurable and positive. We’d like difficulties to be fleeting and comfort to stick around.

When we’re keenly aware of what’s happening, we don’t need to grasp for the next great moment of sensation or taste or sound (all the while missing what’s actually here, right in front of us). Nor do we need to postpone our feeling of happiness until a more exciting or more pleasing object comes along, ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=907))\n- His life is a pursuit of a pursuit forever.

If you do so paying very little attention to the sight of it, the feel, the smell and the taste, then eating the apple isn’t likely to be a fulfilling experience. Becoming aware of a mild discontent, you’re likely to blame the apple for being boring and commonplace. It’s easy to miss the fact that the quality of your attention played a major role in your dissatisfaction.

We don’t need to reach out and grab ever more exotic or forbidden fruit. We develop calm and tranquility—and the calmer we get, the more at home we feel with our body and mind, with life as it is.

What we hope to learn is the difference between thinking and being lost in thought. We don’t want to stop our thoughts but to change our relationship with them—to be more present and aware when we’re thinking. If we’re aware of what we’re thinking, if we see clearly what’s going on in our minds, then we can choose whether and how to act on our thoughts.

The skills we practice when we sit are transferable to the rest of our lives. In Week One we used the tool of concentration to steady and focus the mind. Following the breath, we became aware of thoughts, feelings, and sensations. We noted them and let them go without getting swept away by them, without dodging them or ignoring them (as we might normally have done in our busy daily lives), and without berating ourselves for having them.

How many pleasures escape our notice because we think we need big, dramatic sensations to feel alive? Mindfulness can allow us to experience fully the moment in front of us—what Thoreau calls “the bloom of the present”—and to wake up from neutral so we don’t miss the small, rich moments that add up to a dimensional life.

Progress is not about levels; it’s about frequency. If we can remember to be mindful, if we can add more moments of mindfulness, that makes all the difference. Countless times a day we lose mindfulness and become lost in reaction or disconnected from what is happening. But the moment we recognize that we’ve lost mindfulness, we have already regained it; that recognition is its essence. We can begin again.

Sylvia Boorstein, a writer and teacher, calls it “awake attention to what is happening inside and outside so we can respond from a place of wisdom.” The Vietnamese Zen teacher and poet Thich Nhat Hanh says, “I like to define mindfulness as the energy that helps us to be there one hundred percent; the energy of our true presence.” ([Location 1479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1479))\n- core group of unhealthy human tendencies that are obstacles to happiness. They’re the states of mind that distract us in meditation practice, and trip us up in the rest of our lives. Broadly speaking, they are: desire, aversion, sloth, restlessness, and doubt. ([Location 1551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1551))\n- You may recognize that the thoughts and emotions that come up in this week’s meditations are part of recurring patterns—that you’re hearing a lot of what I call old tapes, the familiar, habitual mental soundtrack I mentioned in the introduction. It’s helpful to acknowledge these tapes of ours, perhaps even to good-naturedly name them: Oh, ([Location 1752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1752))\n- During the meditation about a difficult situation, as I pictured that day, I realized how familiar that ‘one false move and I’m doomed’ feeling is. I don’t know yet why I play that tape—but at least now I know it happens.” ([Location 1765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1765))\n- The fourth-century Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu told this story: There was a man so displeased by the sight of his own shadow and footsteps that he determined to get rid of both by running away from them. But every time he put down his foot, there was another step, and his shadow kept up with him without the slightest difficulty. He thought he must not be running fast enough. So he ran faster and faster and faster, without stopping, until he finally dropped dead of exhaustion. He failed to realize that if he merely stepped into the shade, his shadow would vanish, and if he sat down and stayed still, there would be no more footsteps. ([Location 1777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1777))\n- Practicing mindfulness meditation is making the choice to be still—to step into the quiet shade instead of running away from difficult thoughts and feelings. We sometimes call meditation non-doing. Instead of being swept away by our usual conditioned reactions, we’re quiet and watchful, fully present with what is, touching it deeply, being touched by it, and seeing what is happening in the simplest and most direct fashion possible. ([Location 1782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1782))\n- And being mindful of the moment doesn’t mean that we give up savoring memories or setting goals. I like to quote Thich Nhat Hanh: “To dwell in the here and now does not mean you never think about the past or responsibly plan for the future,” he says. “The idea is simply not to allow yourself to get lost in regrets about the past or worries about the future. If you are firmly grounded in the present moment, the past can be an object of inquiry, the object of your mindfulness and concentration. You can attain many insights by looking into the past. But you are still grounded in the present moment.” ([Location 1880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1880))\n- When we know our thoughts, we neither dodge them nor get lost in them. Instead, we can decide when and if we should act on them; we can better discern which actions will lead to happiness and which to suffering. Meditation allows us to see and accept ourselves as we are in the moment—sometimes hot-tempered and sometimes mellow, sometimes cowardly and sometimes strong, sometimes ashamed and sometimes proud, sometimes confused and sometimes clear. ([Location 1947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1947))\n- The customary phrases are usually variations on May I Be Safe (or May I Be Free from Danger), May I Be Happy, May I Be Healthy, May I Live with Ease—may daily life not be a struggle.

If we’re in the habit of ignoring the humanity of strangers or people we don’t know well, we can experiment with being open and aware, taking an interest, connecting. If we’re in the habit of not really listening while conversing, we can experiment with being more fully present with the next person we speak to. If we’re in the habit of classifying and dismissing people based on what we think we know about them, we can experiment with listening with fresh ears, giving our full attention. If we’re wholehearted, open, interested, we may find that people surprise us.

Once we see clearly what’s going on in the moment, we can then choose whether and how to act on what we’re seeing. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=260))\n- whatever gets our attention flourishes, so if we lavish attention on the negative and inconsequential, they can overwhelm the positive and the meaningful. But if we do the opposite, refusing to deal with or acknowledge what’s difficult and painful, pretending it doesn’t exist, then our world is out of whack. Whatever doesn’t get our attention withers—or retreats below conscious awareness, where it may still affect our lives. In a perverse way, ignoring the painful and the difficult is just another way of feeding the wolf. Meditation teaches us to open our attention to all of human experience and all parts of ourselves. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=282))\n- the feeling of having your attention fractured by job and family, the enticement of electronic diversions, or the chatter of your mind—that morning’s spat with your mate replaying in your head, a litany of worries about the future or regrets about the past, a nervous endless-loop recitation of the day’s to-do list. Parts of that mental soundtrack may be old tapes that were instilled in childhood and have been playing so long we’ve nearly tuned them out of conscious awareness. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=287))\n- Meditation teaches us to focus and to pay clear attention to our experiences and responses as they arise, and to observe them without judging them. That allows us to detect harmful habits of mind that were previously invisible to us. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=300))\n- All forms of meditation strengthen and direct our attention through the cultivation of three key skills—concentration, mindfulness, and compassion or lovingkindness. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=306))\n- The practice entails paying attention to each in-and-out breath, and when your mind wanders (it will, that’s natural), noticing whatever has captured your attention, then letting go of the thought or feeling without berating yourself for it. You then return to focusing on your breathing. In this way meditation trains us to stay in the moment before us instead of reliving the past or worrying about the future. And it teaches us how to be gentle with ourselves and others, to forgive our lapses and move ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=310))\n- But if we apply mindfulness to the experience of anger, we can safely draw close to the emotion instead of fleeing, and investigate it instead of stonewalling. We notice it without judging it. We can gather more information about what happens when we get mad—what sets off the anger, where it lodges in the body, and what else it also contains, like sadness, fear, or regret. This pause for nonjudgmental acknowledgment creates a bit of peaceful space within which we can make new, different choices about how to respond to something like anger. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=324))\n- Mindfulness helps us get better at seeing the difference between what’s happening and the stories we tell ourselves about what’s happening, stories that get in the way of direct experience.

These assumptions we make about who we are and the way the world works—what we deserve, how much we can handle, where happiness is to be found, whether or not positive change is possible—all greatly influence how and to what we pay attention. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=398))\n- Assumptions block direct experience and prevent us from gathering information that could bring us comfort and relief, or information that, though saddening and painful, will allow us to make better decisions. ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=406))\n- You’ll stop limiting yourself. When we practice meditation, we often begin to recognize a specific sort of conditioned response—previously undetected restrictions we’ve imposed on our lives. We spot the ways we sabotage our own growth and success because we’ve been conditioned to be content with meager results. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=414))\n- You’ll weather hard times better. Meditation teaches us safe ways to open ourselves to the full range of experience—painful, pleasurable, and neutral—so we can learn how to be a friend to ourselves in good times and bad. During meditation sessions we practice being with difficult emotions and thoughts, even frightening or intense ones, in an open and accepting way, without adding self-criticism to something that already hurts. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=421))\n- You’ll rediscover a deeper sense of what’s really important to you. Once you look beneath distractions and conditioned reactions, you’ll have a clearer view of your deepest, most enduring dreams, goals, and values.

Meditation practice cultivates qualities such as kindness, trust, and wisdom that you may think are missing from your makeup but are actually just undeveloped or obscured by stress and distractions. You’ll have the chance to access these qualities more easily and frequently.

([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=438))\n- Though we can affect our physical and emotional experiences, we can’t ultimately determine them; we can’t decree what emotions will arise within us. But we can learn through meditation to change our responses to them. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=447))\n- Recognizing what we can’t control (the feelings that arise within us; other people; the weather) helps us have healthier boundaries at work and at home—no more trying to reform everyone all the time. It helps us to stop beating up on ourselves for having perfectly human emotions. It frees energy we expend on trying to control the uncontrollable. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=449))\n- You’ll understand how to relate to change better—to accept that it’s inevitable and believe that it’s possible. Most of us have a mixed, often paradoxical attitude toward change. Some of us don’t think change is possible at all; we believe we’re stuck forever doing things the way we’ve always done them. Some of us simultaneously hope for change and fear it. We want to believe that change is possible, because that means that our lives can get better. But we also have trouble accepting change, because we want to hold on permanently to what’s pleasurable and positive. We’d like difficulties to be fleeting and comfort to stick around. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=452))\n- Everything is impermanent: happiness, sorrow, a great meal, a powerful empire, what we’re feeling, the people around us, ourselves. Meditation helps us comprehend this fact—perhaps the basic truth of human existence, and the one we humans are most likely to balk at or be oblivious to, especially when it comes to the biggest change of all: Mortality happens, whether we like it or not. We grow old and die. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=458))\n- Following our breath while observing how thoughts continually ebb and flow can help us realize that all elements of our experience are in constant flux. During a meditation session, you’ll find it’s natural to go through many ups and downs, to encounter both new delights and newly awakened conflicts that have bubbled up from the unconscious mind. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=464))\n- We can’t control what thoughts and emotions arise within us, nor can we control the universal truth that everything changes. But we can learn to step back and rest in the awareness of what’s happening. That awareness can be our refuge.

([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=637))\n- Thoughts and feelings will inevitably arise and claim your attention, but you’ll practice repeatedly noticing and letting go of these distractions, then returning your awareness to the in and out of your breath. Breathing, discovering you’ve been distracted, and starting over: simple and manageable. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=694))\n- Some of these thoughts and feelings may be fascinating and delightful; some may make you uncomfortable; some may be deadly dull. You’ll practice letting them all go, without taking the time to judge them. This is a crucial first step in learning how to be more centered and present. ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=696))\n- Everyone who meditates, beginners and longer-term practitioners alike, gets hijacked at times by thoughts and feelings; it’s impossible not to be. But once you see how doable it is to start over, you won’t judge your efforts so harshly. And you’ll learn that starting over and not fruitlessly berating yourself are skills you can bring into your everyday life when you’ve made a mistake or lost sight of your aspirations. You can begin again. ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=700))\n- This act of beginning again is the essential art of the meditation practice.

([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=797))\n- success in meditation is measured not in terms of what is happening to us but by how we relate to what is happening. Do you calmly observe your sleepiness, anxiety, or distraction? Success. Do you try to stop punishing yourself for feeling these things? Success.

But the moment we recognize that we’ve lost mindfulness, we have already regained it; that recognition is its essence. We can begin again. ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1472))\n- I’VE HEARD SOME WONDERFUL EXPLANATIONS of mindfulness. Sylvia Boorstein, a writer and teacher, calls it “awake attention to what is happening inside and outside so we can respond from a place of wisdom.” The Vietnamese Zen teacher and poet Thich Nhat Hanh says, “I like to define mindfulness as the energy that helps us to be there one hundred percent; the energy of our true presence.” ([Location 1479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1479))\n- core group of unhealthy human tendencies that are obstacles to happiness. They’re the states of mind that distract us in meditation practice, and trip us up in the rest of our lives. Broadly speaking, they are: desire, aversion, sloth, restlessness, and doubt. ([Location 1551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1551))\n- You may recognize that the thoughts and emotions that come up in this week’s meditations are part of recurring patterns—that you’re hearing a lot of what I call old tapes, the familiar, habitual mental soundtrack I mentioned in the introduction. It’s helpful to acknowledge these tapes of ours, perhaps even to good-naturedly name them: Oh, ([Location 1752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1752))\n- During the meditation about a difficult situation, as I pictured that day, I realized how familiar that ‘one false move and I’m doomed’ feeling is. I don’t know yet why I play that tape—but at least now I know it happens.” ([Location 1765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1765))\n- The fourth-century Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu told this story: There was a man so displeased by the sight of his own shadow and footsteps that he determined to get rid of both by running away from them. But every time he put down his foot, there was another step, and his shadow kept up with him without the slightest difficulty. He thought he must not be running fast enough. So he ran faster and faster and faster, without stopping, until he finally dropped dead of exhaustion. He failed to realize that if he merely stepped into the shade, his shadow would vanish, and if he sat down and stayed still, there would be no more footsteps. ([Location 1777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1777))\n- Practicing mindfulness meditation is making the choice to be still—to step into the quiet shade instead of running away from difficult thoughts and feelings. We sometimes call meditation non-doing. Instead of being swept away by our usual conditioned reactions, we’re quiet and watchful, fully present with what is, touching it deeply, being touched by it, and seeing what is happening in the simplest and most direct fashion possible. ([Location 1782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1782))\n- And being mindful of the moment doesn’t mean that we give up savoring memories or setting goals. I like to quote Thich Nhat Hanh: “To dwell in the here and now does not mean you never think about the past or responsibly plan for the future,” he says. “The idea is simply not to allow yourself to get lost in regrets about the past or worries about the future. If you are firmly grounded in the present moment, the past can be an object of inquiry, the object of your mindfulness and concentration. You can attain many insights by looking into the past. But you are still grounded in the present moment.” ([Location 1880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1880))\n- When we know our thoughts, we neither dodge them nor get lost in them. Instead, we can decide when and if we should act on them; we can better discern which actions will lead to happiness and which to suffering. Meditation allows us to see and accept ourselves as we are in the moment—sometimes hot-tempered and sometimes mellow, sometimes cowardly and sometimes strong, sometimes ashamed and sometimes proud, sometimes confused and sometimes clear. ([Location 1947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1947))\n- The customary phrases are usually variations on May I Be Safe (or May I Be Free from Danger), May I Be Happy, May I Be Healthy, May I Live with Ease—may daily life not be a struggle. ([Location 2047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=2047))\n- If we’re in the habit of seeing only the negative in ourselves and missing the positive, we can experiment with turning our attention to the goodness within us. If we’re in the habit of ignoring the humanity of strangers or people we don’t know well, we can experiment with being open and aware, taking an interest, connecting. If we’re in the habit of not really listening while conversing, we can experiment with being more fully present with the next person we speak to. If we’re in the habit of classifying and dismissing people based on what we think we know about them, we can experiment with listening with fresh ears, giving our full attention. If we’re wholehearted, open, interested, we may find that people surprise us. ([Location 2360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=2360))\n- Remember that we don’t meditate to get better at meditating; we meditate to get better at life.

An optimal response in terms of adaptability to this context involves shared consciousness and decentralised empowered execution.\n```\n\n***\n**Author**: [Stanley McChrystal]  \n**Tags**:  #triage\n***\n\nIn order to adapt its strategy and processes in a complex changing environment they embraced:\n\n- shared consciousness: transparent information sharing\n- empowered execution: decentralised decision making authority.\n\nThis yielded a team of teams. Agility of small teams applied to thousands across countries switching from hierarchies and silos that fostered efficiency in the XX century.\n\nMaps replaced by whiteboards used to draw mutable relations between things. They found tangled networks instead of traditional hierarchical structures.\n\nThey saw this pack of clear structure as a design that should lead to chaos. Learned that an organisation can only be assessed within the surrounding environment. \n\nZeitgeist: interconnectedness, ability to transmit information instantly allow small groups to have global influence.\n\nAdmiral Nelson greatest victory is explained by his innovative managerial approach in which he provided space for initiative and trusted his strategy to his well trained captains. (page 30)\n\n==Limiting factor (limfac)== is an element in a situation that holds you back. In their case was traditional military management.\n\n# Standardization and taylorism\n\nTaylor was a gifted privileged kid, probe to optimise things since childhood and that later stated that 6 months working at a factory at age of 17 was the best education experience he ever had.\n\nHe realised that every worker has its own way to do things and soon realised that there must be \"one best way\". This is the seed oh his theory, scientific management.  In order to find it out he setup experiments aimed at not working harder but more productively.\n\nFor Taylor managers were research scientists and architects of efficiency.\n\nViews of management by Taylor's disciples. Management is:\n- Plan\n- organize\n- command staff\n- coordinate\n- report\n- budget\n\nAlthough his view of workers as lazy People in need of incentives and planners on top of the in order to be motivated, Taylorism Is still much alive in our quest of how to do things better.\n\n\u003e Appreciating the magnitude of what one does not know is one of the main topics of this book\n\n# From complicated to complex\n Technological development has flavoured our abilities to track, measure and communicate but it has also increased complexity making world less predictable.\n\nComplex  systems are those densely interconnected and that interact so frequently that they are really hard to untangle. In addition, those dense interactions cause nonlinear change in the system. An event is unpredictable because it is the result of many causes linked by direct and indirect paths.\n\nComplex systems are fickle and volatile. \nComplex systems: Weather (the butterfly effect by Lorenz), national economies...\n\nComplicated problems have many parts but they can be broken down in a series of deterministic relationships.\n\nWarren Beaver seminal paper \"Science and complexity\"\n\nHayek comments on impossibility to reduce National economies to mechanical systems as markets are the result of decisions of millions of people.\n\nOne strategy to solve complicated problems is breaking the process down into components.\n\nA key difference between complicated and complex is the possibility of predicting the outcome within a time span (ex. Weather in a day, in a year)\n\nBig data provides great insights to gain knowledge on the drivers of complex systems but it does not really improve the long term forecasts. For instance we may know how a Covid outbreak started but it is really difficult to where the next one is occurring.\n\n\n==Decentralisation with coherence==\n\nIn complex environments resilience is key factor for succes. Command and control strategies are usually counterproductive. Instead the strategy should be focus on building resilience. Anti fragile systems benefit from shocks Vs fragile systems that suffer great damage.\n\nIn an uncontrolled quest for optimization we can confront the ugly truth of reducing the resilience of the system. For instance, Zillow instant buyer disregard the trope \" know that we don't know\".\n\nRobustness is about strengthening components of the system. Resilience is about linking them in a way that allows them to reconfigure in response to change.\n\n\n\u003e Efficiency is doing things right, effectiveness is doing the right things. Peter Drucker\n\nRules and limitations that prevents accidents, limit creativity. And sometimes attachment to procedure makes you lose track of what matters (purpose).\n\nBreaking vertical silos was the first step to create a true network of teams that shared information.\n\nGreat teams bonds are built on the trust between members. This trust creates dense connectivity in the team, allowing them to quickly adayto changing environments.\n\nIn simple work environment, workers only need to know what the of their position is. In complex environments, it is important that the team is contextual aware of the overall picture and company strategy.\n\n\nMECE (Mutually Exclusive and Collectively exhaustive) covers all the scope without redundancy. Overlapping functions are inefficient but provides context and flexibility to the team.\n\nBreaking silos between teams by increasing its connectivity, specially in the fault lines (spaces between teams). \n\n# Command of teams\nHow to scale the adaptability of teams across entire organization? How to ensure coordination within the superstructure by increasing trust and purpose without creating chaos?\n\nRobin Dunbar: number of people we can trust, from 100 to 230. Malcolm Gladwell \"Rule of 150\" in his book Outliers. These figures might indicate why the goal of a team might not overlap to the goal of the superstructure it serves. \n\nAs a team grows the number of links to be managed increases exponentially. Team dynamics are delicate and adding new members puts them to test. See the book Leading Teams by Richard Hackman\n\n# Team of teams\n\nCreating meaningful connections in a large organisation as those existing among team members is not easy task.the key is representation. ==You need everyone to know someone on every team.==\n\nLack of information sharing between teams causes breakdowns. These breakdowns are not of not of components but of the integration between them  (==\"interface failures\"==)\n\nNASA Apollo program managerial foundation by George Mueller. Joint cognition like a nervous system. Forced managers and engineers to communicate daily with their functional counterparts in other teams. Daily analysis and quick data exchange via a central control group. \n\nContractors in house along with the resident engineers embraced and understood the Apollo project in its integrity. Systems thinking proposes that one cannot understand part of a system without a rudimentary understanding of the whole.\n\nNASAS managerial system showed that in a domain with great intercependence and uncertainty, contextual understanding is key. Silos provide efficiency gains but interface failures increase costs. \n\n# Systems thinking\nEducation Vs training. Education requires understanding, which allows us to face almost any problem. Training is focused on singular topics that might only be useful for particular issues.\n\nPeople cooperate if they can see the interdependent nature of the environment. That requires having insights on how other teams work and how all pieces fit together by incorporating a knowledge pool.\n\nEach team needs to have an overall understanding of the environment while keeping its own set of capabilities. \"Generalized awareness and specialized expertise\"\n\nThe role of physical arrangement of teams at offices is undeniable. Open plans foster spontaneous interaction and knowledge sharing.\n\nIn the quest of shared consciousness they increased information sharing and changed the briefing processes between juniors and seniors showing newbies how a problem is tackled in real time.\n\nCultural barriers and each team's own narrow perspective posed the main challenges for shared consciousness. This meant creating relationships instead of just seeing other teams as separate forces that get and give.\n\nEmbedding program, a team member spend sometime inside other team to learn how to see war from the other team perspective. \n\nLiaisons, or interfaces, were intermediate roles that connected teams. Liaison members needed to be provided by deep support by the central team in order to be of value for their hosts.\n\nGM was a mess in terms of management, chaotic and lacking coordination and transversal organizer. Alfred Sloan changed the situation by introducing \"decentralised operations and coordinated control\". What we call today as silos, hierarchical command and control structure. This led to great market share gains from 1920 to 1960 but in the 70s it's lac of flexibility to adapt cars to customers chanfi go tasted caused serios troubles. \n\nFord approach, \"working together\" brought by ex responsible of Boeing 777,Mullaly. Ensured systematic transparency and forced interaction (live update 3D model of boeing that could be consulted by any engineer). Integrated designers and engineers as japanese used to do.\n\n\u003e Working together always works. It always works. They have to be interdependent with one another. - Mullalya\n\n# Breaking silos \n\nEmbracing intercependence. Horizontal collaboration foster enterprise effectiveness. Collective intelligence depends on the connection among individuals and the 2 major drivers of idea flow are:\n- Engagement within a team\n- Exploration, frequent contact with other units.\n\nIn order to replace the old silo based system by shared consciousness system two things are needed:\n- Participatory transparency: holistic awareness\n- Internal connectivity across teams: embedding and liason programs.\n\n# Hands off\n\nAlthough managers love to take final decisions, sometimes they trust their teams so much that most of the time they just follow recommendations by team leaders. In that case, manager's approval only adds delay to the process.\n\nAlthough communication flowed freely among teams and many people knew how to \"do the right thing\", decision taking was slow. Avoid the team to ask for permission for routine task. In that case the leader must state clearly thoughts and philosophy on those situations so the team can make the call independently. `cost of delay \u003c cost of errors caused by removing supervisor`\n\nEmpowerment generates intrinsic task motivation. On the other hand micromanagement costs are higher than ever as the interdependence of issues makes lots of situations unpredictable, thus causing heavy deviation from plans. In those situations, empowered teams are the more agile response. \n\nEmpowerment is achieved by delegating decisions on the team and publicly rewarding their initiative. Even when failing. A necessary condition for empowerment to work is contextual understanding.\n\n\u003e In the old model, subordinates provide information and leaders disseminated commands. We reversed it: we had our leaders provide information so that subordinates armed with context, understanding and connectivity, could take initiative and make decisions. \n\n\n# From chess master to gardener\n\nThe chess player commands the different pieces following a strategy. The pieces don't have a general overview of the chessboard, only the master has the necessary context.\n\nA gardener creates the necessary environment to vegetables to grow, but it cannot directly command the growing. Itgst context the main responsibility involves maintaining the teamwork conditions needed. \n\nNothing is heard until is said several times. Only when you hear your own words echoed by subordinates you can be certain the message has been delivered.\n\n\u003e perhaps an organisation sells widgets and the leader finds thar she loves everything about widgets  -designing, building and marketing then; that's still not where the leader is most needed. The leader first responsible is to the whole.\n\nEmpowered execution requires shared consciousness. Empowering people without context leads to havoc.\n\n![[IMG_20220308_233052.jpg]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.498114982Z","tags":null},"/literature-notes/Books/The-Culture-Code":{"title":"The Culture Code","content":"\n```\n\n```\n\n***\n- **Author**:  [Daniel Coyle]\n- **Source**:  https://danielcoyle.com/the-culture-code/\n- **Tags**:  #triage\n***\n\n# Build safety \n\nSuccessful groups feel like family, not like friends, team or tribe.\n\nPatterns of interaction with chemistry:\n- Close physical proximity\n- Eye contac\n- Physical touch\n- Short energetic exchanges (no long speech)\n- Everybody talks to everyone\n- Few interruption\n- Lots of questions\n- Intensive active listening \n- Humor\n- Attentive courtesies\n\nBelonging cues: behaviours that create safe connection in groups.

We call this the constraint—or bottleneck. Either term works. Whatever you call it, until you create a trusted system to manage the flow of work to the constraint, the constraint is constantly wasted, which means that the constraint is likely being drastically underutilized.

It also likely means that you’re not paying down technical debt, so your problems and amount of unplanned work continues to increase over time,” he says.

Trust me, you’ll find that he constrains many other important flows of work, as well.” ([Location 2608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078Y98RG8\u0026location=2608))\n- “There are five focusing steps which Sensei Goldratt describes in The Goal: Step 1 is to identify the constraint.

In the Theory of Constraints, this is typically implemented by something called Drum-Buffer-Rope. In The Goal, the main character, Alex, learns about this when he discovers that Herbie, the slowest Boy Scout in the troop, actually dictates the entire group’s marching pace. Alex moved Herbie to the front of the line to prevent kids from going on too far ahead.

We call this the constraint—or bottleneck. Either term works. Whatever you call it, until you create a trusted system to manage the flow of work to the constraint, the constraint is constantly wasted, which means that the constraint is likely being drastically underutilized. ([Location 2605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078Y98RG8\u0026location=2605))\n- “That means you’re not delivering to the business the full capacity available to you. It also likely means that you’re not paying down technical debt, so your problems and amount of unplanned work continues to increase over time,” he says.

Ever. It should never be waiting on any other resource for anything, and it should always be working on the highest priority commitment the it Operations organization has made to the rest of the enterprise.

We call this the constraint—or bottleneck. Either term works. Whatever you call it, until you create a trusted system to manage the flow of work to the constraint, the constraint is constantly wasted, which means that the constraint is likely being drastically underutilized. ([Location 2605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078Y98RG8\u0026location=2605))\n- “That means you’re not delivering to the business the full capacity available to you. It also likely means that you’re not paying down technical debt, so your problems and amount of unplanned work continues to increase over time,” he says. He continues, “You’ve identified this Brent person as a constraint to restore service. Trust me, you’ll find that he constrains many other important flows of work, as well.” ([Location 2608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078Y98RG8\u0026location=2608))\n- “There are five focusing steps which Sensei Goldratt describes in The Goal: Step 1 is to identify the constraint. You’ve done that, so congratulations. Keep challenging yourself to really make sure that’s your organizational constraint, because if you’re wrong, nothing you do will matter. Remember, any improvement not made at the constraint is just an illusion, yes? ([Location 2612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078Y98RG8\u0026location=2612))\n- “Step 2 is to exploit the constraint,” he continues. “In other words, make sure that the constraint is not allowed to waste any time. Ever. It should never be waiting on any other resource for anything, and it should always be working on the highest priority commitment the it Operations organization has made to the rest of the enterprise. Always.” I hear him say encouragingly, “You’ve done a good job exploiting the constraint on several fronts.

In the Theory of Constraints, this is typically implemented by something called Drum-Buffer-Rope. In The Goal, the main character, Alex, learns about this when he discovers that Herbie, the slowest Boy Scout in the troop, actually dictates the entire group’s marching pace. Alex moved Herbie to the front of the line to prevent kids from going on too far ahead.

The book highlights the dangers of the first-instinct fallacy, where we cling onto old views instead of grappling with new ones, and emphasizes the importance of questioning our beliefs to prevent our ways of thinking from becoming habits that weigh us down. The author explains the concept of being in scientist mode, which involves leading with questions and puzzles, testing hypotheses, and discovering knowledge. Additionally, the book explores the cycles of rethinking, which involve intellectual humility, questioning, curiosity, and discovery.\n\nI really liked the concept of ==confident humility==. A sweet spot between armchair quarterback syndrome (cuñadismo) and impostor syndrome:\n\n\u003e You can be confident in your ability to achieve a goal in the future while maintaining the humility to question whether you have the right tools in the present.\n\nThe author also highlights the importance of being aware of cognitive biases, cultivating a growth mindset, and seeking out diverse perspectives. By being aware of our cognitive biases, we can overcome them and think more critically. Cultivating a growth mindset can help us approach challenges with a willingness to learn and grow, and seeking out diverse perspectives can broaden our understanding of the world and challenge our assumptions.\n\nThe book also emphasizes the value of task conflict, which can be beneficial when it brings diversity of thought, preventing us from getting trapped in overconfidence cycles. The author suggests forming a challenge network, a group of people who will help activate rethinking cycles by pushing us to be humble about our expertise, doubt our knowledge, and be curious about new perspectives.\n\nOverall, the book emphasizes the importance of staying curious, humble, and open-minded, and the benefits of being wrong. By updating our beliefs frequently, admitting when we're wrong, and seeking out diverse perspectives, we can become better thinkers and more effective problem-solvers.\n\n\n## Highlights\n- When a trio of psychologists conducted a comprehensive review of thirty-three studies, they found that in every one, the majority of answer revisions were from wrong to right. This phenomenon is known as the first-instinct fallacy. (Location 112)\n- we often prefer the ease of hanging on to old views over the difficulty of grappling with new ones. (Location 124)\n- Questioning ourselves makes the world more unpredictable. It requires us to admit that the facts may have changed, that what was once right may now be wrong. Reconsidering something we believe deeply can threaten our identities, making it feel as if we’re losing a part of ourselves. (Location 125)\n- Our ways of thinking become habits that can weigh us down, and we don’t bother to question them until it’s too late. (Location 182)\n- Progress is impossible without change; and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything. (Location 257)\n- Mike Lazaridis dreamed up the idea for the BlackBerry as a wireless communication device for sending and receiving emails. (Location 269)\n- Most of us take pride in our knowledge and expertise, and in staying true to our beliefs and opinions. That makes sense in a stable world, where we get rewarded for having conviction in our ideas. The problem is that we live in a rapidly changing world, where we need to spend as much time rethinking as we do thinking. (Location 276)\n- The accelerating pace of change means that we need to question our beliefs more readily than ever before. (Location 284)\n- This is not an easy task. As we sit with our beliefs, they tend to become more extreme and more entrenched. I’m (Location 285)\n- when it comes to our own knowledge and opinions, we often favor feeling right over being right. (Location 295)\n- As we think and talk, we often slip into the ==mindsets of three different professions: preachers, prosecutors, and politicians.== In each of these modes, we take on a particular identity and use a distinct set of tools. We go into preacher mode when our sacred beliefs are in jeopardy: we deliver sermons to protect and promote our ideals. We enter prosecutor mode when we recognize flaws in other people’s reasoning: we marshal arguments to prove them wrong and win our case. We shift into politician mode when we’re seeking to win over an audience: we campaign and lobby for the approval of our constituents. The risk is that we become so wrapped up in preaching that we’re right, prosecuting others who are wrong, and politicking for support that we don’t bother to rethink our own views. (Location 305)\n- If you’re a scientist by trade, rethinking is fundamental to your profession. You’re paid to be constantly aware of the limits of your understanding. You’re expected to doubt what you know, be curious about what you don’t know, and update your views based on new data. In (Location 322)\n- We move into scientist mode when we’re searching for the truth: we run experiments to test hypotheses and discover knowledge. Scientific tools aren’t reserved for people with white coats and beakers, and using (Location 327)\n- to view startups through a scientist’s goggles. From that perspective, their strategy is a theory, customer interviews help to develop hypotheses, and their minimum viable product and prototype are experiments to test those hypotheses. Their task is to rigorously measure the results and make decisions based on whether their hypotheses are supported or refuted. (Location 336)\n- the smarter you are, the more you might struggle to update your beliefs. (Location 382)\n- The better you are at crunching numbers, the more spectacularly you fail at analyzing patterns that contradict your views. (Location 386)\n- ==My favorite bias is the “I’m not biased” bias, in which people believe they’re more objective than others. It turns out that smart people are more likely to fall into this trap. The brighter you are, the harder it can be to see your own limitations==. Being good at thinking can make you worse at rethinking. (Location 393)\n- in scientist mode, we refuse to let our ideas become ideologies. We don’t start with answers or solutions; we lead with questions and puzzles. We don’t preach from intuition; we teach from evidence. We don’t just have healthy skepticism about other people’s arguments; we dare to disagree with our own arguments. (Location 395)\n- In preacher mode, changing our minds is a mark of moral weakness; in scientist mode, it’s a sign of intellectual integrity. In prosecutor mode, allowing ourselves to be persuaded is admitting defeat; in scientist mode, it’s a step toward the truth. In politician mode, we flip-flop in response to carrots and sticks; in scientist mode, we shift in the face of sharper logic and stronger data. (Location 400)\n- ==the purpose of learning isn’t to affirm our beliefs; it’s to evolve our beliefs==. (Location 408)\n- the process of rethinking, I’ve found that it often unfolds in a cycle. It starts with intellectual humility— knowing what we don’t know. (Location 423)\n- Recognizing our shortcomings opens the door to doubt. As we question our current understanding, we become curious about what information we’re missing. That search leads us to new discoveries, which in turn maintain our humility by reinforcing how much we still have to learn. (Location 426)\n- ==If knowledge is power, knowing what we don’t know is wisdom==. (Location 428)\n- ==when people are resistant to change, it helps to reinforce what will stay the same. Visions for change are more compelling when they include visions of continuity==. Although our strategy might evolve, our identity will endure. (Location 462)\n- Anton’s syndrome— a deficit of self-awareness in which a person is oblivious to a physical disability but otherwise doing fairly well cognitively. (Location 505)\n- The opposite of armchair quarterback syndrome is impostor syndrome, where competence exceeds confidence. (Location 544)\n- According to what’s now known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, it’s when we lack competence that we’re most likely to be brimming with overconfidence. (Location 559)\n- It’s when we progress from novice to amateur that we become overconfident. (Location 618)\n- As we gain experience, we lose some of our humility. (Location 627)\n- You can be confident in your ability to achieve a goal in the future while maintaining the humility to question whether you have the right tools in the present. That’s the sweet spot of confidence. (Location 646)\n- We become blinded by arrogance when we’re utterly convinced of our strengths and our strategies. We get paralyzed by doubt when we lack conviction in both. (Location 648)\n- What we want to attain is confident humility: having faith in our capability while appreciating that we may not have the right solution or even be addressing the right problem. That gives us enough doubt to reexamine our old knowledge and enough confidence to pursue new insights. (Location 650)\n- ==the most productive and innovative teams aren’t run by leaders who are confident or humble. The most effective leaders score high in both confidence and humility. Although they have faith in their strengths, they’re also keenly aware of their weaknesses.== (Location 668)\n- we still have a lot to learn about when impostor syndrome is beneficial versus when it’s detrimental. Still, it leaves me wondering if we’ve been misjudging impostor syndrome by seeing it solely as a disorder. (Location 695)\n- When our impostor fears crop up, the usual advice is to ignore them— give ourselves the benefit of the doubt. Instead, we might be better off embracing those fears, (Location 698)\n- impostor is that it can motivate us to work harder. (Location 700)\n- When we feel like impostors, we think we have something to prove. Impostors may be the last to jump in, but they may also be the last to bail out. (Location 705)\n- impostor thoughts can motivate us to work smarter. When we don’t believe we’re going to win, we have nothing to lose by rethinking our strategy. (Location 706)\n- ==feeling like an impostor can make us better learners. Having some doubts about our knowledge and skills takes us off a pedestal, encouraging us to seek out insights from others. ==(Location 708)\n- Plenty of evidence suggests that confidence is just as often the result of progress as the cause of it. (Location 720)\n- sociologist Murray Davis argued that when ideas survive, it’s not because they’re true— it’s because they’re interesting. What makes an idea interesting is that it challenges our weakly held opinions. (Location 797)\n- Neuroscientists find that when our core beliefs are challenged, it can trigger the amygdala, the primitive “lizard brain” that breezes right past cool rationality and activates a hot fight-or-flight response. The anger and fear are visceral: it feels as if we’ve been punched in the mind. The totalitarian ego comes to the rescue with mental armor. (Location 818)\n- Discovering I was wrong felt joyful because it meant I’d learned something. (Location 845)\n- Attachment. That’s what keeps us from recognizing when our opinions are off the mark and rethinking them. To unlock the joy of being wrong, we need to detach. (Location 849)\n- ==two kinds of detachment are especially useful: detaching your present from your past and detaching your opinions from your identity. ==(Location 850)\n- ==Most of us are accustomed to defining ourselves in terms of our beliefs, ideas, and ideologies. This can become a problem when it prevents us from changing our minds as the world changes and knowledge evolves.== (Location 864)\n- ==Who you are should be a question of what you value, not what you believe.== (Location 868)\n- The single most important driver of forecasters’ success was how often they updated their beliefs. (Location 909)\n- If being wrong repeatedly leads us to the right answer, the experience of being wrong itself can become joyful. (Location 932)\n- I consider all of my opinions tentative. When the facts change, I change my opinions.” (Location 948)\n- Research suggests that identifying even a single reason why we might be wrong can be enough to curb overconfidence. (Location 949)\n- “Accept the fact that you’re going to be wrong,” Jean-Pierre advises. “Try to disprove yourself. When you’re wrong, it’s not something to be depressed about. Say, ‘Hey, I discovered something!’” (Location 953)\n- If we’re insecure, we make fun of others. If we’re comfortable being wrong, we’re not afraid to poke fun at ourselves. L==aughing at ourselves reminds us that although we might take our decisions seriously, we don’t have to take ourselves too seriously. Research suggests that the more frequently we make fun of ourselves, the happier we tend to be.== (Location 965)\n- I’ve noticed a paradox in great scientists and superforecasters: the reason they’re so comfortable being wrong is that they’re terrified of being wrong. What sets them apart is the time horizon. They’re determined to reach the correct answer in the long run, and they know that means they have to be open to stumbling, backtracking, and rerouting in the short run. (Location 971)\n- When you form an opinion, ask yourself what would have to happen to prove it false. Then keep track of your views so you can see when you were right, when you were wrong, and how your thinking has evolved. (Location 980)\n- Psychologists find that admitting we were wrong doesn’t make us look less competent. It’s a display of honesty and a willingness to learn. (Location 990)\n- The teams that performed poorly started with more relationship conflict than task conflict. They entered into personal feuds early on and were so busy disliking one another that they didn’t feel comfortable challenging one another. It took months for many of the teams to make real headway on their relationship issues, and by the time they did manage to debate key decisions, it was often too late to rethink their directions. (Location 1047)\n- relationship conflict is generally bad for performance, but some task conflict can be beneficial: it’s been linked to higher creativity and smarter choices. (Location 1057)\n- Task conflict can be constructive when it brings diversity of thought, preventing us from getting trapped in overconfidence cycles. It can help us stay humble, surface doubts, and make us curious about what we might be missing. (Location 1063)\n- Kids whose parents clash constructively feel more emotionally safe in elementary school, and over the next few years they actually demonstrate more helpfulness and compassion toward their classmates. (Location 1068)\n- ==a challenge network, a group of people we trust to point out our blind spots and help us overcome our weaknesses. Their role is to activate rethinking cycles by pushing us to be humble about our expertise, doubt our knowledge, and be curious about new perspectives.== (Location 1107)\n- ==The ideal members of a challenge network are disagreeable, because they’re fearless about questioning the way things have always been done and holding us accountable for thinking again. ==(Location 1109)\n- I’ve watched too many leaders shield themselves from task conflict. As they gain power, they tune out boat-rockers and listen to bootlickers. (Location 1134)\n- We learn more from people who challenge our thought process than those who affirm our conclusions. Strong leaders engage their critics and make themselves stronger. (Location 1139)\n- In science, a challenge network is often a cornerstone of the peer-review process. We submit articles anonymously, and they’re reviewed blindly by independent experts. (Location 1148)\n- looking for disagreeable people who are givers, not takers. ==Disagreeable givers often make the best critics: their intent is to elevate the work, not feed their own egos. They don’t criticize because they’re insecure; they challenge because they care. They dish out tough love.== (Location 1152)\n- ==a good fight club. The first rule: avoiding an argument is bad manners.== Silence disrespects the value of your views and our ability to have a civil disagreement. (Location 1157)\n- They don’t disagree just for the sake of it; they disagree because they care. “Whether you disagree loudly, or quietly yet persistently put forward a different perspective,” Nicole explains, “we come together to support the common goal of excellence— of making great films.” (Location 1181)\n- Agreeableness is about seeking social harmony, not cognitive consensus. (Location 1185)\n- when I argue with someone, it’s not a display of disrespect— it’s a sign of respect. It means I value their views enough to contest them. If their opinions didn’t matter to me, I wouldn’t bother. (Location 1187)\n- John’s natural tendency is to avoid conflict: at restaurants, if the waiter brings him the wrong dish, he just goes ahead and eats it anyway. “But when I’m involved in something bigger than myself,” he observes, “I feel like I have an opportunity, a responsibility really, to speak up, speak out, debate. (Location 1193)\n- Disagreeable people don’t just challenge us to think again. They also make agreeable people comfortable arguing, too. (Location 1202)\n- A major problem with task conflict is that it often spills over into relationship conflict. (Location 1207)\n- Experiments show that simply framing a dispute as a debate rather than as a disagreement signals that you’re receptive to considering dissenting opinions and changing your mind, which in turn motivates the other person to share more information with you. (Location 1219)\n- Starting a disagreement by asking, “Can we debate?” sends a message that you want to think like a scientist, (Location 1222)\n- When we argue about why, we run the risk of becoming emotionally attached to our positions and dismissive of the other side’s. We’re more likely to have a good fight if we argue about how. (Location 1230)\n- This section of the book is about convincing other people to rethink their opinions. When we’re trying to persuade people, we frequently take an adversarial approach. Instead of opening their minds, we effectively shut them down or rile them up. (Location 1337)\n- In an informal debate, you’re trying to change the mind of your conversation partner. That’s a kind of negotiation, where you’re trying to reach an agreement about the truth. (Location 1360)\n- In a negotiation, agreeing with someone else’s argument is disarming. (Location 1370)\n- Most people think of arguments as being like a pair of scales: the more reasons we can pile up on our side, the more it will tip the balance in our favor. Yet the experts did the exact opposite: They actually presented fewer reasons to support their case. (Location 1376)\n- “A weak argument generally dilutes a strong one.” (Location 1378)\n- The more reasons we put on the table, the easier it is for people to discard the shakiest one. Once they reject one of our justifications, they can easily dismiss our entire case. (Location 1379)\n- Recent (Location 1387)\n- We won’t have much luck changing other people’s minds if we refuse to change ours. We can demonstrate openness by acknowledging where we agree with our critics and even what we’ve learned from them. Then, when we ask what views they might be willing to revise, we’re not hypocrites. (Location 1397)\n- Being reasonable literally means that we can be reasoned with, that we’re open to evolving our views in light of logic and data. (Location 1404)\n- when audiences are skeptical of our view, have a stake in the issue, and tend to be stubborn that piling on justifications is most likely to backfire. If they’re resistant to rethinking, more reasons simply give them more ammunition to shoot our views down. (Location 1445)\n- Psychologists have long found that the person most likely to persuade you to change your mind is you. You get to pick the reasons you find most compelling, and you come away with a real sense of ownership over them. (Location 1465)\n- When we point out that there are areas where we agree and acknowledge that they have some valid points, we model confident humility and encourage them to follow suit. When we support our argument with a small number of cohesive, compelling reasons, we encourage them to start doubting their own opinion. And when we ask genuine questions, we leave them intrigued to learn more. We don’t have to convince them that we’re right— we just need to open their minds to the possibility that they might be wrong. (Location 1472)\n- When someone becomes hostile, if you respond by viewing the argument as a war, you can either attack or retreat. If instead you treat it as a dance, you have another option— you can sidestep. (Location 1508)\n- Having a conversation about the conversation shifts attention away from the substance of the disagreement and toward the process for having a dialogue. The more anger and hostility the other person expresses, the more curiosity and interest you show. (Location 1509)\n- move that expert negotiators made more often than average negotiators. They were more likely to comment on their feelings about the process and test their understanding of the other side’s feelings: (Location 1513)\n- If we hold an opinion weakly, expressing it strongly can backfire. Communicating it with some uncertainty signals confident humility, invites curiosity, and leads to a more nuanced discussion. (Location 1529)\n- there’s evidence that people are more interested in hiring candidates who acknowledge legitimate weaknesses as opposed to bragging or humblebragging. (Location 1552)\n- By asking questions rather than thinking for the audience, we invite them to join us as a partner and think for themselves. If we approach an argument as a war, there will be winners and losers. If we see it more as a dance, we can begin to choreograph a way forward. By considering the strongest version of an opponent’s perspective and limiting our responses to our few best steps, we have a better chance of finding a rhythm. (Location 1561)\n- When people hold prejudice toward a rival group, they’re often willing to do whatever it takes to elevate their own group and undermine their rivals— even if it means doing harm or doing wrong. (Location 1617)\n- In every human society, people are motivated to seek belonging and status. Identifying with a group checks both boxes at the same time: we become part of a tribe, and we take pride when our tribe wins. (Location 1630)\n- our beliefs are like pairs of reality goggles. We use them to make sense of the world and navigate our surroundings. A threat to our opinions cracks our goggles, leaving our vision blurred. (Location 1650)\n- we become especially hostile when trying to defend opinions that we know, deep down, are false. Rather than trying on a different pair of goggles, we become mental contortionists, twisting and turning until we find an angle of vision that keeps our current views intact. (Location 1652)\n- When you get to see an overview of the Earth from outer space, you realize you share a common identity with all human beings. (Location 1682)\n- common identity can build bridges between rivals. (Location 1684)\n- In an ideal world, learning about individual group members will humanize the group, but often getting to know a person better just establishes her as different from the rest of her group. (Location 1717)\n- In psychology, counterfactual thinking involves imagining how the circumstances of our lives could have unfolded differently. (Location 1779)\n- People gain humility when they reflect on how different circumstances could have led them to different beliefs. They might conclude that some of their past convictions had been too simplistic and begin to question some of their negative views. (Location 1787)\n- We might question the underlying belief that it makes sense to hold opinions about groups at all. (Location 1819)\n- It’s a rare person who wants to hear what he doesn’t want to hear.—Attributed to Dick Cavett (Location 1864)\n- Refuting a point of view produces antibodies against future influence attempts. We become more certain of our opinions and less curious about alternative views. (Location 1890)\n- motivational interviewing. The central premise is that we can rarely motivate someone else to change. We’re better off helping them find their own motivation to change. (Location 1911)\n- Motivational interviewing starts with an attitude of humility and curiosity. We don’t know what might motivate someone else to change, but we’re genuinely eager to find out. The goal isn’t to tell people what to do; it’s to help them break out of overconfidence cycles and see new possibilities. Our role is to hold up a mirror so they can see themselves more clearly, and then empower them to examine their beliefs and behaviors. (Location 1926)\n- The process of motivational interviewing involves three key techniques: Asking open-ended questions Engaging in reflective listening Affirming the person’s desire and ability to change (Location 1931)\n- When we try to convince people to think again, our first instinct is usually to start talking. Yet the most effective way to help others open their minds is often to listen. (Location 1978)\n- In motivational interviewing, there’s a distinction between sustain talk and change talk. Sustain talk is commentary about maintaining the status quo. Change talk is referencing a desire, ability, need, or commitment to make adjustments. (Location 1999)\n- The idea is to explain your understanding of other people’s reasons for change, to check on whether you’ve missed or misrepresented anything, and to inquire about their plans and possible next steps. (Location 2018)\n- A good guide doesn’t stop at helping people change their beliefs or behaviors. Our work isn’t done until we’ve helped them accomplish their goals. (Location 2024)\n- Part of the beauty of motivational interviewing is that it generates more openness in both directions. Listening can encourage others to reconsider their stance toward us, but it also gives us information that can lead us to question our own views about them. (Location 2025)\n- Listening well is more than a matter of talking less. It’s a set of skills in asking and responding. It starts with showing more interest in other people’s interests rather than trying to judge their status or prove our own. (Location 2052)\n- A skilled motivational interviewer resists the righting reflex— although people want a doctor to fix their broken bones, when it comes to the problems in their heads, they often want sympathy rather than solutions. (Location 2059)\n- “To speak with him was to be seduced by an inverse charisma, a sense of being listened to with such intensity that you had to be your most honest, sharpest, and best self.” (Location 2085)\n- Inverse charisma. What a wonderful turn of phrase to capture the magnetic quality of a great listener. (Location 2087)\n- Arnaud asked if he could share some information about vaccines based on his own expertise. “I started a dialogue,” he told me. “The aim was to build a trusting relationship. If you present information without permission, no one will listen to you.” (Location 2096)\n- We now know that where complicated issues are concerned, seeing the opinions of the other side is not enough. Social media platforms have exposed us to them, but they haven’t changed our minds. (Location 2145)\n- Hearing an opposing opinion doesn’t necessarily motivate you to rethink your own stance; it makes it easier for you to stick to your guns (Location 2149)\n- Psychologists have a name for this: binary bias. It’s a basic human tendency to seek clarity and closure by simplifying a complex continuum into two categories. (Location 2151)\n- Walt Whitman, it takes a multitude of views to help people realize that they too contain multitudes. (Location 2155)\n- A dose of complexity can disrupt overconfidence cycles and spur rethinking cycles. It gives us more humility about our knowledge and more doubts about our opinions, and it can make us curious enough to discover information we were lacking. (Location 2156)\n- Non (Location 2178)\n- A fundamental lesson of desirability bias is that our beliefs are shaped by our motivations. What we believe depends on what we want to believe. (Location 2189)\n- To overcome binary bias, a good starting point is to become aware of the range of perspectives across a given spectrum. (Location 2212)\n- As (Location 2228)\n- when experts express doubt, they become more persuasive. When someone knowledgeable admits uncertainty, it surprises people, and they end up paying more attention to the substance of the argument. (Location 2235)\n- If you want to get better at conveying complexity, it’s worth taking a close look at how scientists communicate. One key step is to include caveats. (Location 2260)\n- Researchers typically feature multiple paragraphs about the limitations of each study in their articles. We see them less as holes in our work and more as portholes to future discoveries. (Location 2262)\n- In a series of experiments, psychologists demonstrated that when news reports about science included caveats, they succeeded in capturing readers’ interest and keeping their minds open. (Location 2264)\n- idea cults— groups that stir up a batch of oversimplified intellectual Kool-Aid and recruit followers to serve it widely. They preach the merits of their pet concept and prosecute anyone who calls for nuance or complexity. (Location 2307)\n- Appreciating complexity reminds us that no behavior is always effective and that all cures have unintended consequences. (Location 2316)\n- John Rawls, the veil of ignorance asks us to judge the justice of a society by whether we’d join it without knowing our place in it. I think the scientist’s veil of ignorance is to ask whether we’d accept the results of a study based on the methods involved, without knowing what the conclusion will be. (Location 2319)\n- What works is not perspective-taking but perspective-seeking: actually talking to people to gain insight into the nuances of their views. That’s what good scientists do: instead of drawing conclusions about people based on minimal clues, they test their hypotheses by striking up conversations. (Location 2332)\n- In one experiment, if an ideological opponent merely began by acknowledging that “I have a lot of respect for people like you who stand by their principles,” people were less likely to see her as an adversary— and showed her more generosity. (Location 2339)\n- What (Location 2351)\n- movement to teach kids to think like fact-checkers: the guidelines include (1) “interrogate information instead of simply consuming it,” (2) “reject rank and popularity as a proxy for reliability,” and (3) “understand that the sender of information is often not its source.” (Location 2451)\n- Lectures aren’t designed to accommodate dialogue or disagreement; they turn students into passive receivers of information rather than active thinkers. (Location 2487)\n- one of the hallmarks of an open mind is responding to confusion with curiosity and interest. One student put it eloquently: “I need time for my confusion.” Confusion can be a cue that there’s new territory to be explored or a fresh puzzle to be solved. (Location 2580)\n- he turned the classroom into a challenge network. Every week— and sometimes every day— the entire class would do a critique session. (Location 2595)\n- As (Location 2607)\n- education is more than the information we accumulate in our heads. It’s the habits we develop as we keep revising our drafts and the skills we build to keep learning. (Location 2630)\n- Rethinking is more likely to happen in a learning culture, where growth is the core value and rethinking cycles are routine. In learning cultures, the norm is for people to know what they don’t know, doubt their existing practices, and stay curious about new routines to try out. (Location 2679)\n- psychologically safe teams reported more errors, but they actually made fewer errors. By freely admitting their mistakes, they were then able to learn what had caused them and eliminate them moving forward. In psychologically unsafe teams, people hid their mishaps to avoid penalties, which made it difficult for anyone to diagnose the root causes and prevent future problems. They kept repeating the same mistakes. (Location 2691)\n- psychological safety is not a matter of relaxing standards, making people comfortable, being nice and agreeable, or giving unconditional praise. It’s fostering a climate of respect, trust, and openness in which people can raise concerns and suggestions without fear of reprisal. It’s the foundation of a learning culture. (Location 2698)\n- A (Location 2706)\n- How do you know? It’s a question we need to ask more often, both of ourselves and of others. The power lies in its frankness. It’s nonjudgmental— a straightforward expression of doubt and curiosity that doesn’t put people on the defensive. (Location 2729)\n- I knew that changing the culture of an entire organization is daunting, while changing the culture of a team is more feasible. It starts with modeling the values we want to promote, identifying and praising others who exemplify them, and building a coalition of colleagues who are committed to making the change. (Location 2743)\n- managers to share their past experiences with receiving feedback and their future development goals. We advised them to tell their teams about a time when they benefited from constructive criticism and to identify the areas that they were working to improve now. (Location 2753)\n- By admitting some of their imperfections out loud, managers demonstrated that they could take it— and made a public commitment to remain open to feedback. They normalized vulnerability, making their teams more comfortable opening up about their own struggles. Their employees gave more useful feedback because they knew where their managers were working to grow. (Location 2754)\n- managers to create practices to keep the door open: they started holding “ask me anything” coffee chats, opening weekly one-on-one meetings by asking for constructive criticism, and setting up monthly team sessions where everyone shared their development goals and progress. (Location 2757)\n- It takes confident humility to admit that we’re a work in progress. It shows that we care more about improving ourselves than proving ourselves.* (Location 2787)\n- We preach about its virtues and stop questioning its vices, no longer curious about where it’s imperfect and where it could improve. Organizational learning should be an ongoing activity, but best practices imply it has reached an endpoint. We might be better off looking for better practices. (Location 2795)\n- Exclusively praising and rewarding results is dangerous because it breeds overconfidence in poor strategies, incentivizing people to keep doing things the way they’ve always done them. (Location 2808)\n- Amy Edmondson finds that when psychological safety exists without accountability, people tend to stay within their comfort zone, and when there’s accountability but not safety, people tend to stay silent in an anxiety zone. When we combine the two, we create a learning zone. (Location 2815)\n- In learning cultures, people don’t stop keeping score. They expand the scorecard to consider processes as well as outcomes: Even if the outcome of a decision is positive, it doesn’t necessarily qualify as a success. If the process was shallow, you were lucky. If the decision process was deep, you can count it as an improvement: you’ve discovered a better practice. If the outcome is negative, it’s a failure only if the decision process was shallow. If the result was negative but you evaluated the decision thoroughly, you’ve run a smart experiment. (Location 2824)\n- Rethinking is more likely when we separate the initial decision makers from the later decision evaluators. (Location 2841)\n- When we dedicate ourselves to a plan and it isn’t going as we hoped, our first instinct isn’t usually to rethink it. Instead, we tend to double down and sink more resources in the plan. This pattern is called escalation of commitment. (Location 2931)\n- Sunk costs are a factor, but the most important causes appear to be psychological rather than economic. Escalation of commitment happens because we’re rationalizing creatures, constantly searching for self-justifications for our prior beliefs as a way to soothe our egos, shield our images, and validate our past decisions. (Location 2935)\n- gritty people are more likely to overplay their hands in roulette and more willing to stay the course in tasks at which they’re failing and success is impossible. (Location 2940)\n- There’s a fine line between heroic persistence and foolish stubbornness. (Location 2943)\n- what do you want to be when you grow up? Pondering that question can foster a fixed mindset about work and self. “I think it’s one of the most useless questions an adult can ask a child,” Michelle Obama writes. “What do you want to be when you grow up? As if growing up is finite. As if at some point you become something and that’s the end.”* (Location 2947)\n- Kids might be better off learning about careers as actions to take rather than as identities to claim. When they see work as what they do rather than who they are, they become more open to exploring different possibilities. (Location 2956)\n- When second and third graders learned about “doing science” rather than “being scientists,” they were more excited about pursuing science. Becoming a scientist might seem out of reach, but the act of experimenting is something we can all try out. (Location 2961)\n- A successful relationship requires regular rethinking. Sometimes being considerate means reconsidering something as simple as our habits. (Location 3024)\n- the more people value happiness, the less happy they often become with their lives. (Location 3038)\n- we spend too much time striving for peak happiness, overlooking the fact that happiness depends more on the frequency of positive emotions than their intensity. (Location 3043)\n- when we hunt for happiness, we overemphasize pleasure at the expense of purpose. (Location 3044)\n- When we pursue happiness, we often start by changing our surroundings. We expect to find bliss in a warmer climate or a friendlier dorm, but any joy that those choices bring about is typically temporary. (Location 3063)\n- “You can’t get away from yourself by moving from one place to another.” (Location 3066)\n- students who changed their actions by joining a new club, adjusting their study habits, or starting a new project experienced lasting gains in happiness. (Location 3067)\n- when it comes to careers, instead of searching for the job where we’ll be happiest, we might be better off pursuing the job where we expect to learn and contribute the most. (Location 3077)\n- passions are often developed, not discovered. (Location 3078)\n- By investing in learning and problem solving, we can develop our passions— and build the skills necessary to do the work and lead the lives we find worthwhile. (Location 3081)\n- happiness less as a goal and more as a by-product of mastery and meaning. (Location 3090)\n- “Those only are happy,” philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote, “who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness; on the happiness of others, on the improvement of mankind, even on some art or pursuit, followed not as a means, but as itself an ideal end. Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness by the way.” (Location 3091)\n- open systems are governed by at least two key principles: there are always multiple paths to the same end (equifinality), and the same starting point can be a path to many different ends (multifinality). (Location 3095)\n- At work and in life, the best we can do is plan for what we want to learn and contribute over the next year or two, and stay open to what might come next. (Location 3102)\n- writing out a plan for your life “is like driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.” (Location 3104)\n- in every line of work, there are people who become active architects of their own jobs. They rethink their roles through job crafting— changing their daily actions to better fit their values, interests, and skills. (Location 3111)\n- The simplest way to start rethinking our options is to question what we do daily. (Location 3125)\n- The scientific method can be traced back several millennia, at least as far back as Aristotle and the ancient Greeks. I was surprised to learn, then, that the word scientist is relatively new: it wasn’t coined until 1833. (Location 3171)\n- There’s a lot we don’t know about how to communicate confident humility. When people lack knowledge about a complex topic— like stopping a pandemic or reinvigorating an economy— they might be comfortable with leaders admitting what they don’t know today and doubting the statements they made yesterday. (Location 3204)\n- Complex problems like pandemics, climate change, and political polarization call on us to stay mentally flexible. In the face of any number of unknown and evolving threats, humility, doubt, and curiosity are vital to discovery.

What business want to achieve in which data can help business suceed.\n\n5 strategic use case areas:\n1. How data can help everyone in an organisation make better and faster decisions\n2. Using data to gain customer and market insights. Understand your customers \u003e successful in markets\n3. Smarter products and services. Personalisation.\n4. Using data to improve and automate the way a business operates\n5. Data monetisation. Turning data into income. \n\nCreate a strong business case for using data. \n\n# 1. Data driven decision making\nTwo key elements:\n1. Self-service. A company gives more people access to more data so they can answer their business questions. \n2. Curated dashboards. Idenbtify and communicate the strategic data sets and metrics. Identify information needs. \n\t1. identify Key business questions\n\t\t1. Analyse strategy and goals\n\t\t2. For each goal define questions that need answering\n\t\t3.Identify metrics or data sets to answer those questions\n\nThe right data leads to smarter decisions. \n\nCommon pitfalls:\n- Dont give executives access to self service tools with the hope that they will find their own answers\n- Dont put irrelevant or badly visualised data into dashboards or reports\n\n\u003e Drowning in data while thirsting for insights\n\n\n### Challenges related to self service data exploration\n\nCreating data cubes and connecting it with a data viz tool does not ensure data-driven decision making\n\nWorking with data and setting up a firms data infrastructure \n\nLeadership should promote data driven decision making.  Build the right culture of delegated decision making\nEnsure an improved data literacy. Training and emphasis on developing data-related skills\n\nProvide the right tools to your employees. Once the tools are in place, additionatl training and support is required. Data café in Walmart or data translators between business and analytics teams. \n\nProvide access to the right quality data. Use single source of truth, invest in master data management, conduct data audits.\n\n### Asking key business questions first\n\n\u003e Good questions outrank easy answers. Paul Samuelson\n\nData driven decision making starts by defining the questions that need to be answered. Then we need to define how to use data to answer the questions in an informed way\n\n`Key Business Questions`  capture business information needs and are the biggest unaswered questions or what managers need to know about their organisation. Focus our attention on the questions that really matter and provide guidance for collecting meaningful and relevant data.\n\nThe power of clear Key Business Questions.\n- Telecom wanted to know most profitable customers and profitability over the long run. Rephrased as CLTV. How loyal are profitable customers. Churn rates. \n\nGood questions lead to good answers.\n\n#### How do you develop good business questions?\n\n1. Start with strategy. Clarify strategic objectives and start developing KBQs. The fewer KBQs the better.\n2. Engage people in the KBQ design. List \u003e subject matter experts \u003e \n3. Try to phrase your KBQs as open questions. Open up the dialogue. \n4. Focus your KBQs on the present and the future. \n5. Keep your KBQs short and clear. \n6. Refine your KBQs by using them. \n\n### Give people access to data\nYou democratise data driven decision making. Avoid analytics team bottleneck. \n\n### Curating the most important data insights\nFor the most strategic data needs we need curated dashboards. A well design dashboard helps monitoring the key business goals. \nRemember not everyone can read graphs. Include text based descriptions. \nIt allows companies to control narrative and data storytelling. \n\n\n# 2. Using data to understand your customers \n\nData allows companies to understand their customers and the market conditions they are operating in.\n\nIntuitions, past experiences, knowledge passed down through previous generations. Getting big catch depends more on luch than on facts. \n\nA butcher shop in London using beacons to track pedestrian inflow and testing different signs.\n\nNetflix everything they do is based on data and AI. Content creation, recommendations. Autogenerate thumbnails. Streaming optimization. Post production and editing. \n\nAmazon. Recommendations. Income level. 360 degree customers. \n\n### Real time data to understand customers\n\nImportance of real time data in Covid. \n\n# 3. Using data to provide more intelligent services\n\n3 wayts busiensser are delivering a better servbice through data and AI\n1. Delivering a highly personalised offering. The more understainding of the customers the more you can fill their needs. Stitchfix. \n\t-  Engangement\n\t- Factors encouraging engagement\n\t- A major business trend. Customer expect more intelligent services.\n\t- Netflix, Amazon, Stitch Fix\n2. Giving customers more value.  Making customers life easier better. \n3. Predicting customers needs. Anticipatory shipping by Amazon. Predictive maintenance needs by Kone. \nThe most successful service providers of the future will use data and AI to provide thoughtful solutions. \n\nHuge benefits of smart products\n1. Making customers lives easier. IoT. Thermostat. More efficient, more automated, more responsive\n2. Building better products. Better understanding of your customers. Better product design. \n3. Responging to customers needs more quickly. Google's micromoments\n4. Adding new revenue streams. Crossover between smart products and smart services. \n\n# 4. Using data to improve your business processes\n\nMake business more efficient more streamline, more cost effective and better coping with changing business needs\n1. Improving meetings. AI and data cant eliminate meeting just yet. Schedule appointments, catpure highlight and actions. EVA assistant and Sonia\n2. Enhancing sales and marketing. \n\t1. Predict customers most likely to generate more revenue. Most likely to \n\t2. Chatbots\n3. Assesing and improving customer service\n\t1. Judge quality of customers calls\n\t2. Detect problematic customer service\n3. Improving product development processes\n\t- Generative design to generate multiple designs from a single idea\n4. Automatic content generation. Writing industry articles and reports.\n5. Automatic content generation. Writing industry articles and reports.\n6. Enhanding the manufacture process\n \t- Collarbotive robots (Cobots)\n8. Refining recruitment\n\t- pymetrics\n\n# 5. Monetising your data\nMain approaches to data monetization\n\t1. Create extra value for your organizaction from data\n\t2. Sell data to your customers or other interested third parties. \n\t\t- It can be a by product. Visa\n\t\t- Cosmose Ai. Anonymized mobile phone data. \n- Ask the right questions first before collecting datra with the idea of selling it.\n\nCreate distinct commercial units charged with the topic of data monetization. Benefit of saving other divisions strategic focus and complete responsability to the dedicated unit. \n\n## Shotspotter case study\nMonitors the soundscape of a city. The sound data is interpretted by algorithms and it helps locating gun shots. It sells the data to police office. Real time gun usage in neighborhoods. \n\n\n# Defining data use cases\n\n## 1. Identifying data use case\n\nYou have to link data use case to business strategy to ensure data delivers maximum value for your business. \nLooking what your business is trying to achieve, identify potential solutions through the use of data.\nDont limit yourself to a small number of use cases at this stage, we will be narrowing down options in the second step. Now we need to explore the many ways in which data could help your organization. \n\nCan come from any of the discussed areas:\n1. How data can help everyone in an organisation make better and faster decisions\n2. Using data to gain customer and market insights. Understand your customers \u003e successful in markets\n3. Smarter products and services. Personalisation.\n4. Using data to improve and automate the way a business operates\n5. Data monetisation. Turning data into income. \n\n##  Link to a strategic goal\n\nIt is vital to link each use case to a business strategic goal. If you cannot question yourself if it is really worth the expense. \n\n```\nHow would this use of data help the busienss achieve its objectives, grow and prosper?\n```\n\nTemplate for each use case:\n\n### Data objective\n\n### Measure of success or KPIs\nWhich business metrics we can track progress. \n\n### Business ownership\nWho in the business would be responsible and assume overall ownership of the project.\n\n### Users and data customers\nLearning from the insights\n\n### Required data\nStructured data, unstructured data. Internal and external data.\n\n### Data governance\nKeep data safe and who owns it. \n\n### Data analysis\nTurn data to insights\n\n### Technology\nIdentifying which software and hardware to use\n\n### Skills and capacity\nDo we need to train in house, use in house people or outsource?\n\n### Implimentation and change management\nAnticipate road blocks\n\n\n## 2. Prioritize use case\n\nDon-t be tempted to prioritize more than 2 or 3. \n\nLookg for quick wins, short-term smaller data projects. Demonstrate people the value of data, win people over and saw the seeds for bigger projects.\n\nIdentify and prioritizing data use cases should be done at least yearly but better each quarter.  \n\nLook for common themes, complementarities and overlaps in terms of data requirements, data govbernance, tech, skills and technology. Address them holistically.\n\n# Sourcing and collecting data\n\nHow to collect the right data? \n\nThe art is automated as much as possible. Find the right type of data that fits your needs. \n\nDifferent types of data:\n- Structured \n- Unstructured \n\n- Internal\n- External\n\nFind the best combination to get the most useful insights for your business\n\n## Structured vs unstructured\nStructured is organised data, can be put in tabular form easily. \nUnstructured, unorganised data, cannot be put in tabular form easily. 80-90%.\n\nSemi-structured have some elements of structure (metadata) for instance photo metadata. \n\n## Internal vs external\nInternal data: Owned or collected by the organization. Useful in the long run and it is useful advantage. Usually cheap or free to access. \nExternal data: A third party data. All information which exists outsiede. Publicly availabe or pivately owned by 3rd parties. Data brokers. Paid in most cases, less control of the quality, less reliable for strategically important and business critical insights. Ponder the risks and benefits from external data. \n\nUsually companies rely too much on internal data, can biased perspective. The sweet spot usually requires a mix of internal and external data.\n\n\n## Types of data\n\nDigial trace of what we do, how owte\n\n- Activity data\n- Conversation data\n- Photo data\n- Video data\n- Sensor data\n\n## Meta data\nData that describes other data. Metadata summarises data about p. Helps IT systems uncover what they are looking for. \nGives a competitive advantage\nNot prioritised right now\n\nMetadata management structure. Drives digital asset management. Allows analysts to unlock meaning in Big data. \n\n## The importance of real time\nStreaming data and analytics. Competitive edge on competitors. \n\nDynamic data that is generated continously from a variety of sources. It allows real time insights, better decision making and more personalized customer services.\n\nStreaming analytics analytics while the data is in the stream, not when it has been stored. It allows proactivity, proactivity and agility. \n\nUse cases examples:\n- Maintenance, identify issues in real time\n- Health care\n- Retail\n- Social media\n- Finance\n- Energy\n\n## Gathering internal data\n\nOnce we have identified the data you need already exists. If it is not available are we able to collect it internally?\n\nCollect conversation data. \nText-based conversations.\nSurveys\nPhoto and video data\nTransaction data, very easy to access and analyse.\nFinancial data\n\nSensors can be incorporated into almost anything. \n\n## Accessing external data\nData as a business commodity. Even very specific data is being collected and sold.\nCan be acquiered for free from government datasets, social media platforms, google trends, weather data. \n\n## Sources of external data\nWorld bank, IMF, ML archive...\n\n## When the data you want does not exist\nYou will have to find a away to generate and collect it. It might be the source of a competitive advantage. \nSprigg mobile test centers with IoT to measure soil conditions. \n\n# Data governance, ethics and trust\nInstead of becoming a valuable asset it can become a liability. Legal and result compliance\nRegulations are being introduced. \n\nORganizations need to be careful with:\nData ownership\n\tOwn data that is essential to your business. Own or not own? It it easy to own internal data, but with external data can create future problems for your business.\n\nHow do i ensure the correct rights are in place. \n\nInclude your legal team when dealing with data privacy. \n\nCase study Royal Bank. Personoly give some real value back to customers and deliver value back to them. Develop trust to give value to customers. A core element in the data strategy. Ensure customers that the data isnt used against them. \n\n# Building the dasta competencies in your organisation\n\n## Skills shortage\nSupply of capable DS is low\nMore data related programs in the market\nPoor definition of the job role\n\n## Building internal skills and competencies\nHire data professionals and help them grow.\nIdentify individuals inside organization.\n\n## Outsourcing your data analysis\nHire external services if\n- Unable to hire at decent price\n- No SMEs in house\nFocus on skills transfers from consultants to the team.\n\n## Leadership challenges\n\nA good leader is aware of the intelligence revolution and understandce its importance.\nA business leader appraches data analysis and AI strategically and not technically\nIdentifies how to bes use AI and data analysis in their business\nFInds a strategic sponsor for AI and data analysis initiatives. \n\nChief AI Officer. \n- Sets the vision for using AI\n- Educates about the importance of AI\n- Places the ethical frameworks for AI usage\n- Builds the right skills, capacity and tech infrastructure\n- Oversees execution and delivery\n- Manages stakeholders\n\n\n# Executing and revisiting your strategy\n\nThe execution of a firm's data strategy needs to start at the top. The senior leadership team needs to have buy-in and if that happens, everyone else will follow. It usually creates a top down ripple effect where the importance of data as a core asset is understood.\n\nAttitudes that kill the data strategy in its inception:\n- We are not a data company. Every business is a data business. \n- Working with data and implementing a data strategy in practice is too expensive.\n- We already have more data than we need. \n- Everyone else is already ahead of us. \n- Our customers aren't interested.\n\nEducation and concrete examples of the industry you are operating in usually works great to achieve sponsors.\n\n## Why data strategies fail\n\nData strategy needs to be in sync with the goal of the company. \n\n- Lack of communication\n- Staff engangement\n- Lack of communications between teams. ==End-to-end process owners==\n- Lack of specialized workforce\n\nWhat you need in general to prevent these issues is good communication and a high level of buy-in across the organization.\n\n\n## Creating a data culture\n\nBuilding a robust data culture means getting people on board with the firm's data strategy. \n\nThere is a culture shift for many organizations to go from relying exclusively on their intuition and insticts but on decisions that are justified with data and facts.\n\nOne proven way to establish a strong data culture is to involve some of the brightest employees during the process of forming a data strategy and implementing it. \n\nIf one of your primary aims is to use data to understand your customers better, then it makes sense to involve the head of marketing and key marketing personnel.\n\nIt is important that a firm's leadership team make an effort to engage people in their company's data strategy underlining how will improve the business.\n\nIt is a great idea to showcase examples and studies from other companies to demonstrate how data helped a company in practice, and examples that are from your own industry are even better.\n\nNegativity can be contagious. If people on your team or even worse, entire teams become skeptical and pessimistic, try to understand what problems they have in their work and explain how data can be helpful to make their job easier.\n\nBuild trust, be transparent. \n\n## Revisiting the data strategy\nReview it periodically.\n1. Do you have different business needs? The faster industry changes, the more often we should review our data strategy.\n2. Has technology evolved?\n\n\n# Using data for good\nOpportunity to tackle the greatest challenges.

In order to change culture you need to change people's minds. Make them curious, open to change and collaborative. To reach all of this you need to have purpose and intention, you need to make employees accountable by building trust (being transparent and vulnerable) and you must be appreciative when they make the right things.\n\n```\n\n***\n- **Author**: [[Dr Larry Senn]]\n- **Source**:  https://open.spotify.com/episode/6GsIPCSEZ3l6AVAf29EqVU?si=244c1ef2dea9432a\n***\n\n1st phd thesis on corporate culture (1969), first culture shaping consultancy firm (1978). \n\nCorporate culture and productivity. It is easier to decide a change than to make people change.\nOrganizations as dysfunctional families, trust issues, resistence to change... No matter how good is the idea, it is hard to implement.\n\nCompanies, like people, has a personality. \n\n[Tipping point](https://www.thoughtco.com/malcolm-gladwell-tipping-point-theory-3026765), the culture is the greatest determinant of survival of an organization. \n\nUnsconscious resistence to change. You have to change people minds to curious instead of judgemental. \n\nWhy don't you complain about gravity? You don't wake in the morning and say oh my, another day with gravity. Stop complaining about things you cannot do anything about. Stoicism powa.\n\nYou have to untrain the blame culture. As a manager you have the win/lose mindset (prefer not lose) and also this mindset in which you cannot make mistakes. So if a project is falling behind you look for someone else to blame. But what you have to ask is what can you do in this context to make it work?\n\nHow do change adults habits? You need an epiphany. Covid was an unfreezing moment. \n\nCulture is the way people behave and work together: accountable vs victims, collaborative vs territorial, resist change vs open to change, curious vs judgemental.  Culture is the same across the world, the difference is style. \n\nShadow of the leaders: How CEOs and senior leaders behave goes down in the organization. You need to start change at the top.\n\nThere is a huge void in people feeling appreciated and valued in organizations. Younger generation needs healthy organizacions with cultures that respect people, appreciative. \n\nEncouraging empowerment in teams: Training accountability + (inspiring, appreciating people for doing the right thing)\n\nThe rate of change pushes the need of agile companies. \n\nCulture is the enabler of all initiatives. The main enablers of culture: having purpose, performance value: accountability. Bedrock of honest and integrity. \n\nIncentives for performance.  Recognising culture. Appreciative feedback and constructive feedback. Got a recognised by your boss in front of your peers. \n\nCash rewards + jerk supervisors you won't get the grass cut. \n\nHow do you build trust? Openness builds trust. Transparency builds trust. Vulnerability builds trust.  Leaders must show vulnearable, be open, consistent, dependable, appreciating...\n\nDisconnected initiatives != transformative change. \n\nLeaders need to lead with the why, not the what. What it makes a difference, Why you are important to me. Values != leadership. Leaders need to model things in the organization. \n\nEgo factor in the culture for a balanced organization. If leaders are humble, vulnerable. Company with big ego = problems. Confidence and intention, not for ego. \n\nBe here now. Be present. Not wandering mind.

Perception of your work is really important to build trust. \n\t\t\t- Explain what's happening behind the scenes\n\t\t\t- Factor in unknowns when giving estimates: Explain there is data you never looked at. If you have never done, say it. \n\t\t\t- Be explicit about when someone will hear from you next. Be more predictable. Be clear of hidden costs and explain how your constraints impact delivery. RTB = run-the-business work you need to do to keep the lights on. Make this a visible part of your roadmap. Be clear that maintenance is needed. \n\t\t\t- DACI: Driver, Approver, Consulted, Informed. Use [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DGRlGq8nffTpLg5OB1fjnKNY4O4j6_yogq18q88HafE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\t\t\t- Don't act like a service team. You don't let them treat you like a service desk. No one likes to be treated like a service team, on the other hand people usually want requests to be well described. You don't want to build transactional relationship. Learn the domain because it is critical for interpretation and mapping to semantic concept that is valuable for the organization.  Domain knowledge helps not getting nontrivial knowledge. Put yourself in the stakeholder's shoes, they might have lots of pressure or they might have time constrains. You should commit to the same goals, you should feel responsible to make PMs get faster to a goal. This also creates tighter bonds. \n\t\t- Build engagement: If we want our organizations to use data in their decision making process we need to help them to do it \n\t\t\t- Make your work easy to consume:  \n\t\t\t\t- Focus on what your stakeholders can control, if you give them good choices backed up by your analysis they will demand more. \n\t\t\t\t- Make your work linkable, make it concrete somehow: documentation, a dashboard, a slide deck. It helps making decisions without you in the loop. Easy to reference, easy to build upon. \n\t\t\t\t- Know when to make a snack vs prepare a meal. : Modularise analysis in small chunks that people can consume. A meal can also be made up of small components that can be digest easily. \n\t\t\t- Be predictable:\n\t\t\t\t- Reliability and consistency earn more trust than speed\n\t\t\t\t- Decide how you will push value to stakeholders\n\t\t\t\t- Act like you have paying customers: [Semanting versioning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-semantic-versioning/) is a good mental model, to frame how significant your contributions are. \n\t\t\t- Find ways to surprise and delight:\n\t\t\t\t- Share unexpected findings and thoughtful innovations\n\t\t\t\t- Packages them well. If you do this it is really important to contextualise. Be a sumellier, build taste with easy wines, then move to more complex wines. Give people things that you know they like, show them gradually what it is possible. \n\t\t\t\t- Don't overindex on this. Use it judiciously.\n\t\t\t- Set a good example, then be willing to let go.

While a junior developer may be able to produce linear impact with their hours spent on a task, a senior developer can create exponential impact by mentoring junior team members as explained in [From entry level to senior+ developer - Multiply impact with developer leverage](https://www.susanshu.com/entry-level-to-senior-developer-multiplier).\n\nBy taking the time to teach an entry-level colleague, the senior person can not only reduce the development time of the junior, but also impart their knowledge and expertise to the junior. This has the added benefit of reducing the senior person's own workload, freeing them up to work on tasks that only they can do, while the junior can take care of maintenance or evolution.\n\nMoreover, mentoring helps to spread the senior person's skills and knowledge throughout the team or organization, creating a more robust and resilient team that can handle complex challenges more effectively. Mentoring can also create a positive feedback loop, where junior team members become more skilled and confident, leading to even greater impact and productivity for the entire team.\n\nIn short, mentoring is a highly effective way for senior developers or data scientists to create leverage and have a greater impact beyond their own work. By sharing their expertise with junior team members, they can create exponential impact, reduce their own workload, and contribute to the development of a more skilled and effective team.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.498114982Z","tags":null},"/notes/202202052202-Different-managerial-styles":{"title":"202202052202 - Different managerial styles","content":"\nEffective management requires the use of different managerial styles to suit different situations and team members. The success of a manager often depends on their ability to adapt their approach to the needs and strengths of their team.\n\nOne reason for the need for different managerial styles is that each team member is unique, with their own personality, strengths, and weaknesses. A good manager recognizes these individual differences and tailors their approach to suit each person. For example, some team members may thrive on autonomy and require minimal supervision, while others may need more guidance and direction.\n\nAnother reason for the need for different managerial styles is that different situations call for different approaches. For instance, a crisis situation may require a more directive, hands-on approach from the manager, while a routine task may require a more hands-off approach.\n\nFurthermore, different styles of management can be more effective in different organizational cultures. For instance, a highly collaborative, team-oriented culture may require a more participative, democratic leadership style, while a more hierarchical, top-down culture may benefit from a more directive leadership style.\n\nUltimately, the need for different managerial styles stems from the fact that no two situations, teams, or team members are exactly alike. Effective managers are those who are able to recognize these differences and adapt their approach accordingly. They are able to flex their leadership style to fit the needs of the situation and the team, and to use a variety of management techniques to motivate, engage, and support their team members. By doing so, they are able to build strong, high-performing teams that can achieve their goals and meet the needs of the organization.\n\nWhen it comes to data science, the need for different managerial styles is even more pronounced. Data science is a rapidly evolving field that attracts professionals from a wide range of backgrounds, including computer science, statistics, mathematics, engineering, and many more. As a result, data science teams are often highly diverse, with team members possessing a wide range of skills, expertise, and personalities.\n\n\n\n ","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.498114982Z","tags":null},"/notes/202202052202-Understanding-low-level-data-science":{"title":"202202052202 - Understanding low level data science","content":"\nHaving a deep understanding of the low-level details of data science techniques can be highly beneficial for data professionals in several ways.\n\nFirstly, it allows them to have a deeper understanding of the underlying principles and assumptions of the techniques they are using. This understanding enables them to choose the right tool for the job and to adapt the technique to the specific context they are working on. For instance I majored in spatial econometrics, a set of techniques to deal with spatial autocorrelation. I have not been able to use them at scale but they provide me the intuition to do spatial feature engineering in some of the projects I worked.\n\nSecondly, a deeper understanding of low-level details allows data scientists to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces. This helps them to identify the most relevant parts of a technique for their specific use case and to adapt it as necessary. For example, having an understanding of the inner workings of deep learning models can help a data scientist to identify the most relevant layers and parameters for a specific project.\n\nThirdly, having a deep understanding of data science techniques helps data professionals to avoid becoming \"library practitioners\" who rely solely on pre-existing libraries and packages without much thought. While libraries can be useful, they are not always a perfect fit for every use case. A deep understanding of the underlying principles and assumptions of a technique can help a data scientist to make informed decisions about when and how to use libraries, and to adapt them to their specific needs.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that having a deep understanding of data science techniques is not a guarantee of success. It is important to ensure that these skills are aligned with the specific needs and goals of a project or organization. For instance, being an expert in deep learning may not be useful in a company that does not use this technology. Ultimately, the key is to strike a balance between depth of knowledge and relevance to the specific context in which a data professional operates.","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.498114982Z","tags":null},"/notes/202205171305-Reversible-and-irreversible-decision-making":{"title":"2202205171305 - Reversible and irreversible decision making","content":"\nBefore making a decision we should analyse it and meta-decide whether that decision is reversible or not irreversible.\n\nIt is a mental model [proposed by Bezos at Amazon]([inc.com](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-this-is-how-successful-people-make-such-smart-decisions.html)) to know when a decision should be made quickly or if a deeper analysis is needed. \n\nMany irreversible decisions are made irrationally driven by necessity [having a sense of being in control of your life]([Quitting your job is the new divorcing your partner at 40 and becoming a 'runner'](https://www.elconfidencial.com/cultura/2022-05-01/dejar-trabajo-divorciarte-gran-renuncia_3416531/)). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.498114982Z","tags":null},"/notes/202210141310-Data-is-not-objective":{"title":"202210141310 - Data is not objective","content":"\nData is not objective.

It is an ongoing process that allows us to refine our understanding of the world and better align our beliefs with the actual state of affairs. When our beliefs accurately map onto reality, we are better equipped to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions to achieve our goals.\n\nThe value of rationality lies in its ability to help us avoid common cognitive biases that can lead to inaccurate beliefs and poor decision-making. By using evidence-based reasoning and critical thinking, rationality enables us to evaluate information in a systematic and objective way. We can weigh the evidence for and against a particular belief, and use that information to adjust our understanding of the world.\n\nThe benefits of rationality extend beyond just the realm of decision-making. A more accurate understanding of reality can help us better appreciate the world around us, and develop a more nuanced and sophisticated view of the world. By adopting a rational approach to our beliefs, we can expand our horizons, challenge our assumptions, and become more informed and engaged members of society.\n\nIn summary, rationality is a powerful tool for creating a more accurate understanding of the world, enabling better decision-making, and achieving our goals.

Carlos suggested that I enroll in a newly-created Master's program in Economic Analysis and Game Theory in the University of Oviedo, as well as offering me a scholarship to work as a research assistant. Throughout my time working in the department, I received ample support from most of the senior staff, but it was Jose Baños, the Master's coordinator, who left the greatest impact on my career.\n\nJose was incredibly supportive of me and my colleague, Manu.

Their generosity in sharing their experiences, knowledge, and advice with me directly impacted my growth as a professional.\n\nAs you can see from my story, my mentors played a vital role in shaping my career during crucial moments. That's why I strongly believe in giving back and paying it forward by offering guidance to others. As such, I'm always open to speaking with strangers who may need support in their own career journeys. To make myself more available, I've established weekly [Office Hours](Office%20Hours.md) where individuals can reach me with any questions or concerns they may have. Providing advice to those in need is something that I find both fulfilling and rewarding.\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.498114982Z","tags":null},"/notes/202303032203-My-workflow-for-my-public-second-brain":{"title":"202303032203 - My workflow for my public second brain","content":"\nIn this post, I'm going to share my workflow for sharing my notes on my personal website.\n\n![Digital-Garden](notes/attachments/Digital-Garden.png)\nMy workflow relies on two key elements:\n-   A personal vault where I write and store all my notes.\n-   A public vault used for sharing the public view of my digital garden.\n\nHere are the tools I use:\n\n-   [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for capturing ideas and taking notes on physical books, talks, and podcasts.\n-   [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read) for highlighting and processing literature notes.\n-   [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) for synchronizing my notes across devices.\n-   [Github](https://github.com/) for backups and publishing.\n-   [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) and [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) for moving notes from the personal vault to the public one.\n-   [🪴 Quartz 3.3](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) for hosting my public digital garden.\n-   [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) for analytics.\n\nHere's how my workflow works:\n1. FIrst I capture information: \n\t- On my laptop or smartphone, I write rough drafts of my ideas in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and save them to my personal vault. These notes usually reside in a staging folder, waiting to be processed into proper, permanent notes.\n\t- I use [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read) to read content and highlight important passages. Sometimes I also write notes or use its integrated GPT-3 to summarize parts of the content. These highlights and notes are synced to my personal vault every hour using the [Official Readwise plugin for Obsidian](https://github.com/readwiseio/obsidian-readwise). The integration between Obsidian and Readwise works seamlessly.\n2. My notes are synchronized between my laptop and smartphone using [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) and backed up on [Github](https://github.com/).\n3. I publicly share my permanent notes, longer writings, and literature notes. These notes are copied from my personal vault to the folder that feeds the content to my public personal site built with [🪴 Quartz 3.3](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). For this purpose I use [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to trigger [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) commands for the three folders containing those three types of notes. . Here's an example of the command I use:\n\n``` \n0 * * * * rsync -av  --exclude '000*' /data/projects/obsidian/pelayoarbues/notes/ /data/projects/quartz/content/notes/\n```\n\nExplanation of the commands:\n- `0 * * * *` Runs the script every hour at minute 0.\n-   `rsync`: the command to sync files and directories\n-   `-av`: the options to archive the files and directories (preserve permissions, timestamps, etc.) and to show verbose output\n-   `--exclude '000*'`: the option to exclude files that start with \"000\". These are index files that I use in my personal obsidian but of no interest for the public.\n-   `/data/projects/obsidian/pelayoarbues/notes/`: the source directory to sync, with a trailing slash to include its contents\n-   `/data/projects/quartz/content/notes/`: the target directory to sync to, with a trailing slash to specify that it's a directory\n\nNote that the trailing slashes are important to ensure that the contents of the directories are synced and not the directories themselves.\n\n4. My personal website is pushed to a Github repo with an associated Github action that builds the Quartz site.

However, they have never complained directly to you. Eventually, you receive news that some of those teammates are dissatisfied with certain aspects of your work, but they are not telling you the truth directly. What went wrong? You consider yourself an easygoing, approachable person, but they are not being sincere with you.\n\nIn this situation, most people tend to blame others. However, human relationships are not always straightforward. In my experience, this is usually a two-sided problem. Perhaps your colleagues need to learn how to provide feedback constructively, but it is also quite possible that you need to work on your attitude when receiving feedback.\n\nBe honest with yourself; do you embrace criticism or make a plethora of excuses when receiving feedback? If you are simply listening to respond instead of fully grasping the message, your defensiveness will be noticed by the person providing feedback. Giving negative feedback is already uncomfortable enough, and defensiveness makes it even more difficult.\n\nIt is easy to say that you have a growth mindset, but the truth is that most of us struggle to shift our thoughts and realize that we can improve in any aspect of our work. The challenge is to understand that if you are open to recognizing your mistakes and eager to improve, with a growth mindset, you are on your way to overcoming them.\n\nSo next time you find yourself in a situation where the feedback you receive differs from previous feedback, ask yourself if you are actively listening or if you are not in the mood to receive the message. But also be aware that, in a hypothetical situation where your colleagues were masters of direct feedback and you had the most open mind in the world, we are still human beings, and we may not always share our complete thoughts with each other face-to-face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.498114982Z","tags":null},"/notes/202303162303-The-Data-Vantage-Point":{"title":"202303162303 - The Data Vantage Point","content":"\nAs data professionals, we have a unique perspective on the company as a whole.

This approach allows us to obtain energy efficiency measures at country level that are a robust alternative to the energy intensity indicators commonly used for international comparisons. A transitive multilateral price index is constructed for aggregating the diverse energy components employed in the sector. Due to the likely unobserved heterogeneity among countries, the use of a random parameters model is proposed to accommodate these differences and to obtain different income and price elasticities per country. The estimated model is compared with alternative approaches of addressing this issue such as latent class, true fixed effects or true random effects models. This study is the first to use a random parameters stochastic frontier approach in the estimation of energy demand functions. The proposed procedure is applied to Latin America and the Caribbean, where the transport sector represents a large share of total energy consumption.\n\n**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.5547/01956574.38.5.mllo](https://doi.org/10.5547/01956574.38.5.mllo)","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.506114902Z","tags":null},"/research/A-dynamic-approach-to-road-freight-flows-modeling-in-Spain":{"title":"A dynamic approach to road freight flows modeling in Spain","content":"\nAuthors: Pelayo Arbués, José F. Baños\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis paper presents an innovative approach to analyzing road vehicle freight traffic that uses a dynamic panel data specification derived from a gravity model.

This effect has been labeled the spillover effect. In this study, the existence of direct and spillover effects of road, railway, airport and seaport infrastructure projects is tested by estimating a production function. Together with this primary objective, two common concerns in the literature are addressed: the lack of theoretical foundations for spatial econometrics models and the likely endogenous relationship between transport infrastructure and economic development. The estimated production function takes the form of a Spatial Durbin Model and is estimated using panel data from the 47 peninsular Spanish provinces by alternatively applying a Maximum Likelihood estimator and Instrumental Variables/Generalized Method of Moments estimators. According to the estimates, road transport infrastructure positively affects the output of the region in which the infrastructure is located and its neighboring provinces, while the remaining modes of transportation projects cause no significant impacts on average.\n\n\n**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2015.03.010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2015.03.010)","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.506114902Z","tags":null},"/research/research":{"title":"Research","content":"\nI worked as an applied economist in the Academia since 2007 until 2014. \n\n[The spatial productivity of transportation infrastructure](research/The%20spatial%20productivity%20of%20transportation%20infrastructure.md)\n\n[A Stochastic Frontier Analysis Approach for Estimating Energy Demand](research/A%20Stochastic%20Frontier%20Analysis%20Approach%20for%20Estimating%20Energy%20Demand.md)\n\n[Determinants of ground transport modal choice in long-distance trips in Spain](research/Determinants%20of%20ground%20transport%20modal%20choice%20in%20long-distance%20trips%20in%20Spain.md)\n\n[A dynamic approach to road freight flows modeling in Spain](research/A%20dynamic%20approach%20to%20road%20freight%20flows%20modeling%20in%20Spain.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.526114702Z","tags":null},"/tags/literature-note/":{"title":"Literature Note","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.526114702Z","tags":null},"/tags/permanent-note/":{"title":"Permanent Note","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.526114702Z","tags":null},"/tags/writing/":{"title":"Writing","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.526114702Z","tags":null},"/writing/Agile-for-Data-Science":{"title":"Agile for Data Science","content":"\nMy experience working with agile methodologies in Data Science projects is quite bitter. It did not work for small companies. Neither did it for the larger ones starting their journey in advanced analytics. In both environments, Data Scientists usually work on more than one project at a time (They can even be considered [floor sweepers](https://publish.obsidian.md/dr-mario/pages/%F0%9F%97%A3%EF%B8%8F+Down+with+Data+Science), but that is another story). In that situation, if a project running in agile has no fully dedicated team the whole system crumbles, but that is not specific to Data Science. \n\n![](writing/attachments/pelayo_workers_in_front_of_a_wall_full_of_post-it_in_an_office.png)\n\nIn this writing, I follow this great [post by Eugene Yan](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/data-science-and-agile-what-works-and-what-doesnt/) to keep the discussion going. \n\nData Science is not engineering, although lots can be learned from [engineering good practices](https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/). There are a few characteristics of Data Science that makes it quite difficult to run under agile:\n- Not well-defined problems: Usually Product Owners, Product Managers (PMs) come with ill-defined problems. Similar objectives can be achieved with different data and very different techniques.  It might be something really specific like I need to query this data, but the ultimate objective of that query is something quite different, and it is not clear even in PMs' brains. It is usually not even clear what data to use as a similar concept can be approached from different data perspectives. Retrieving the data and running an adequacy assessment might be time-consuming and also an iterative process. In these preliminary steps, you have to reach a problem definition. \n- The science: unknown paths to be taken, difficulty to estimate the time to be spent in the different steps from one project vs another. Only a few times does the data speak by itself and you do not need to really deep dive into the details. Usually, you need time to grasp the quality and fit of the data to solve the question. The question, goal, and paths taken usually evolve as the analysis is running, so you need to change the scope. Although you have a well-defined DS workflow and process, the amount of effort at each step may vary between projects. \n- Research question: Related to the science it is the idea that Agile ceremonies push you to make a bet and put your efforts to solve a goal. Agile is supposed to be a methodology that allows you to pivot from one particular topic to other, so you should be able to move forward easily. The truth is that maybe the data indicates that the current goal is unfeasible and pushes you to a very different scenario. In my experience Agile lacks of general perspective and as Fabien Girardin says in this tweet, it does not help you asking if you are asking the wrong question. \n\n{{\u003c tweet user=\"fabiengirardin\" id=\"1526806791157317632\" \u003e}}\n\n- Deliverables: Data Science is not engineering. For a PM it may be natural to think that if they can ask a software engineer for a new feature, she can do the same to a Data Scientist. Sometimes DS deliverables are difficult to be defined in advance during sprint planning. A successful DS deliverable might be an analysis or discovery that works as input for the next step in the DS workflow. It is quite likely that this output does not fit the definition of something usable for the end-user and that may be reported upwards. Sometimes a DS deliverable might be something as discouraging as data quality issues. \n- It hurdles DS innovation. Data Science has a really large potential of transforming companies. DS can optimize the company's performance by tweaking processes. These sorts of tasks are important but lead to incremental improvements, not exponential changes. Innovation may happen when  DS follows data trails without a clear purpose. \n\nWhat I like about agile\n- Clear priorities with deliverables: A desirable skill of Data Scientists is curiosity. However, DS should know when to tame their curiosity and when they have to chase it even if it leads them to rabbit holes.  Sprint planning and execution create an environment that ensures the DS is focused on delivering specific outcomes. \n- Short deadlines: A short deadline keeps your feet on the ground and pushes you to use the most simple techniques. Moreover, having a time budget helps you define feasible solutions. \n- Deliverables focused on the ultimate objective. Reminds me of a problem-solving technique of the  [climber's technique](https://giorgionardone.com/en/strategic-logic-and-problem-solving/). This technique allows you to untangle a complex problem and set micro objectives that you can go solving. \n\nManaging Data Science projects is difficult because of the complicated nature of data challenges, the innate curiosity of Data Scientists, and the usual lack of a mature data culture in the company. Experiment and be flexible and try to accommodate the method to the project and the people involved. Don't fall in love with a methodology, tweak it to make it work for you. \n\nAndrew Ng take on the differences between ML systems and software systems in its newsletter The batch:\n\"We don’t know how accurate the system will be in advance. \nWe might need a costly initial data collection phase.\nAfter getting the initial dataset, we might come back and ask for more data or better data. Moreover, we might ask for this over and over. \nAfter we’ve built a prototype that runs accurately in the lab, it might not run as well in production because of data drift or concept drift. \nEven after we’ve built an accurate production system, its performance might get worse over time for no obvious reason. We might need help monitoring the system and, if its performance degrades over time, invest further to fix it. \nA system might exhibit biases that are hard to detect.\nIt might be hard to figure out why the system gave a particular output. We didn’t explicitly program it to do that! \"\"\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.526114702Z","tags":null},"/writing/Buscas-tu-primer-empleo-de-Ciencia-de-Datos":{"title":"Buscas tu primer empleo de Ciencia de Datos?","content":"\nDesde junio de 2020 cada semana trato de tener una conversación con personas desconocidas que me contactan para charlar conmigo sobre distintos temas relacionados con el mundo de los datos. La mayoría de las charlas son con perfiles junior que no tienen claro cómo empezar/formarse o que quieren empezar/hacer la transición a un puesto de Ciencia de datos.\n\n  \nEstas conversaciones me aportan mucho pero sobre todo me han ayudado a ser más sensible a la distinta velocidad a la que va el mercado de Data Scientists según la experiencia del candidato. Según testimonios sacados de estas conversaciones, y de otras mantenidas con gente de mi red, entre los años 2015 y 2019 un Data Scientist sin apenas experiencia lograba encontrar y aterrizar en posiciones abiertas sin mucha dificultad. A partir de ese año empiezo a observar que el proceso de entrar a un primer empleo comienza a ser algo más difícil. Esto se debe principalmente a la proliferación de formaciones en Data Science que han dado lugar a una bolsa grande de aspirantes que compiten de manera intensa por su primera posición.\n\nAsí, en 2022 nos encontramos en una situación en la que los candidatos noveles a posiciones de Data Scientist no encuentran empleo tan rápidamente como esperaban. Desde las escuelas de formación se bombardea a los alumnos (clientes) con cifras sobre la falta de perfiles de datos y los altos sueldos que se ganan en el oficio. Esto es cierto, pero sólo en parte, ya que esa falta de perfiles actualmente se refiere a perfiles con cierta experiencia (sobre todo en cuanto a poner soluciones en producción y con impacto en el negocio) o perfiles muy especializados (expertos en NLP, bioestadística o Computer Vision)\n\n\u003e No eres tú, es el mercado.\n  \nEn muchas de esas conversaciones hablamos de esa frustración que provoca este desencuentro entre las expectativas del candidato y su experiencia en el proceso de búsqueda de empleo. Una de los primeros mensajes que envío es el mismo que he desarrollado en los parrafos anteriores: no eres tú, es el mercado. Creo que es importante que la persona entienda que pese a los cantos de sirena de abundancia de empleo y sueldo para estos perfiles, le toca competir con muchos otros en su misma situación y que no es tanto una cuestión de si valgo/no valgo para este trabajo.\n\n\nY a partir de entender esta realidad el siguiente paso que aconsejo en esa situación es construir una estrategia. A lo que me refiero es que esa búsqueda de primer empleo puedes orientarla de determinadas maneras. Una estrategia puede ser aplicar a todo lo que lleve el título relacionado con Data Science. Una estrategia alternativa puede ser optimizar tu búsqueda aplicando únicamente a aquello que creas que mejor se ajusta a tu perfil y expectativas.\n\n\n\u003e Aplicar a todos los puestos de Data Scientist puede no ser tu estrategia óptima\n\n\nLa mayoría de las personas con las que hablo siguen la estrategia de disparar a todo lo que se mueve. No tiene porque ser mala estrategia a corto plazo, pero si no te funciona rápido puedes acabar sepultado en pruebas técnicas y procesos eternos con todo el estrés que conlleva. Creo que es importante que los candidatos se enfrenten al proceso de búsqueda con una estrategia explícita y de esa manera poder evaluarla y ajustarla a las valoraciones que reciban. Una estrategia tipo que suelo plantear, a modo de ejemplo es la siguiente:\n\n1. **Análisis de fortalezas/debilidades**\n\nEl primer paso es muy evidente pero no todo el mundo lo hace. Quizás lo más importante sea dedicar cierta reflexión de las condiciones iniciales de las que se parte. Si su formación/experiencia es Ciencias Sociales (hello my fellow economists) posiblemente sea razonablemente fuerte en análisis de datos, pensamiento analítico, modelización, estadística y causalidad. Para aquellos candidatos que vienen de carreras más técnicas/posiciones de ingeniería es muy posible que su fuerte sea conocimiento de algoritmos, computación, eficiencia de código, buenas prácticas en desarrollo de software y conocimientos de tecnología. Simplificando mucho entre estos dos tipos de perfiles podríamos asumir en términos generales que las fortalezas de uno son las debilidades del otro, aunque lo cierto es que cada persona tiene que hacer este análisis de manera cruda sobre su propio perfil. Y cuando digo cruda me refiero a que si has dado una clase de SQL, una introducción a la estadística o un modulo de Deep Learning no te puedes considerar experto en esas herramientas.\n\n2. **Búsqueda de posiciones que mejor se ajusten a tus fortalezas/debilidades**\n\nUna vez tengas claras las capacidades/carencias que tienes, toca identificar las oportunidades laborales. Aquí lo primero a tener en cuenta es que Data Science es un [término paraguas](https://scientistemily.substack.com/p/save-data-science?s=w). Esto significa que la gente cuando dice Data Science se refiere a a multitud de posiciones y además su significado no es estándar. Dentro de Data Science puedes encontrar puestos cercanos a Data Engineer, Data Analyst, ML Engineer, DataOps y cada empresa tiene su propia definición. Una manera de maximizar tu probabilidad de encontrar un primer puesto es orientarte hacia aquellos que más se ajustan a tus habilidades. ¿Suena razonable, no? La mala noticia es que, además de no diferenciar en el nombre la posición, las descripciones de las ofertas en Data Science parecen haber sido fotocopiadas unas de otras. Aunque haya poca señal en la descripción, el aspirante siempre puede minar algo de información y lo mismo ocurre durante las primeras etapas del proceso. En esas primeras entrevistas con RRHH o la persona responsable del proceso, hay que ser muy proactivo en tratar de discernir qué tipo de funciones está la empresa tratando de cubrir. En esta búsqueda de posiciones hay que considerar que, si nuestro objetivo es acabar alcanzando una posición de Data Scientist, podemos llegar a ese puesto pasando primero por una posición cercana. Así suelo recomendar a la gente con formación y experiencia menos técnica que intenten primero encontrar posiciones de Data Analysts o posiciones tituladas de Data Science pero con más contenido de Analítica de datos. Como Data Analyst es muy probable que estes mucho menos expuesto a problemas ingenieriles pero vas a estar mucho más pegado al negocio lo cual puede ser una experiencia fundamental en él exito de tu carrera en el mundo de los datos. Los perfiles más ingenieriles pueden comenzar como Data Engineers y esto les va a permitir ganar mucha autonomía en la preparación del dato para futuros proyectos de Ciencia de Datos. Lo que quiero decir es que dar un rodeo puede ser una buena manera de alcanzar el objetivo y que además puede suponer una experiencia muy enriquecedora para los candidatos, así que es una opción a tener en cuenta en la estrategia. Además una vez que estás dentro es posible que surjan oportunidades para que participes en proyectos de los que te apetece hacer.\n\n3. **Exhibición de tus habilidades en el proceso de selección y autocrítica**\n\nPor último, una vez ya en el proceso de selección hay que saber demostrar tus fortalezas. Así ante una prueba o entrevista técnica los perfiles más analíticos deberían demostrar sus habilidades en pensamiento crítico, visualización de datos y cómo hacer útil el análisis para el negocio. Para ser más concreto, de este tipo de perfiles me espero que trabajen muy bien el dato que se les pase haga un EDA exhaustivo, identifiquen problemas en la calidad del dato y hagan una buena discusión acerca de los valores faltantes y atípicos. Por su parte los perfiles más técnicos deberán demostrar su capacidad para desarrollar librerías que puedan ser reutilizables por otros DS o en otros proyectos, aplicando buenas prácticas en el desarrollo del software y teniendo en cuenta temas como la complejidad computacional y la eficiencia del código.\n\nCon este ejemplo de estrategia lo único que pretendo es indicar a los candidatos que es importante que [analicen sus condiciones, las soluciones que han intentado y no han funcionado y que replanteen sus objetivos](https://elpeoncoronado.com/problem-solving-estrategico/). Vamos, nada que no esté ya inventado. A lo largo de mi carrera he aplicado estrategias diferentes. Así cuando hice la transición del mundo académico a la industria mis primeros intentos consistían en tirar a todo lo que se movía. Mi estrategia buscaba aprender cómo eran los procesos de selección y qué solían buscar las empresas. En el camino coseché sonoros rechazos en empresas en las que me hubiera encantado trabajar, pero creo que en todos los procesos aprendí algo que me ayudó a mejorar en siguientes oportunidades. Según voy desenmascarando mis carencias en el propio puesto de trabajo busco nuevas posiciones que me permiten crecer en aquellos aspectos en los que tengo maś recorrido.\n\n\n\u003e \"Goals are for Losers\" - Scott Adams.\n\n\nAl final, como dice [Scott Adams](https://www.scottadamssays.com/goals-vs-systems/) es mejor tener sistemas a ponerse objetivos, y mi sistema consiste en exponerme a trabajos y funciones que no se hacer [todavía](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/the-power-of-yet/) y que me resultan estimulantes. Si todavía no has logrado conseguir tu primer empleo de DS espero que estas reflexiones te sirvan para no desesperar y para darle una pensada a tu proceso de búsqueda.\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.526114702Z","tags":null},"/writing/Como-contratar-DS-y-no-desesperar-en-el-intento":{"title":"Como contratar DS y no desesperar en el intento","content":"\nA raíz de la anterior publicación en el blog sobre cómo conseguir un primer empleo de Data Scientist recibí bastantes preguntas de managers con dudas sobre cómo afrontar el proceso de contratación. En este artículo comparto unas notas rápidas que pueden servir para analizar si el proceso que lideras es todo lo racional que debería.\n\nAntes de empezar un pequeño aviso: Desde que me incorporé al mundo del dato en el sector privado hace unos 7 años he participado de manera activa en la contratación de unos 15 perfiles de Data Scientist (DS), así que tampoco tengo un historial enorme de contrataciones. \n\n## Fortalezas/debilidades del equipo y diversidad\n\nLo habitual es que los equipos de DS tengan menos personal del necesario para afrontar los proyectos. En esta circunstancia es tentador pescar rápidamente a la primera persona que aparezca y que sea suficientemente buena, esté disponible y con ganas. \n\nSi lo haces así, posiblemente estés obviando que esa persona no es exactamente lo que necesitas. Como dice [Julie Zhuo](https://twitter.com/joulee), autora de [The Making of a Manager](https://fellow.app/blog/management/julie-zhuo-the-making-of-a-manager/), es como cuando tienes hambre para cenar: cualquier cosa te puede valer, pero seguramente si hubieses planificado tu cena comerías algo mejor.\n\n\u003e Analiza necesidades presentes y futuras\n\nPara eso te tienes que tomar tu tiempo para identificar qué proyectos hay a la vista, qué líneas se abrirán en el futuro, en qué habilidades el equipo es fuerte/débil y qué personalidades y experiencias añaden diversidad a la hora de afrontar problemas.\n\nSi haces este ejercicio es posible que te des cuenta de que no necesitas un DS, que lo que en realidad necesitas es un Data Engineer (o dos). O que quizás ya tienes suficientes economistas varones blancos. O que necesitas una DS que sea más ingeniera ([Tipo B](https://medium.com/@jamesdensmore/there-are-two-types-of-data-scientists-and-two-types-of-problems-to-solve-a149a0148e64)) que analista (Tipo A).\n\n## Haz del proceso de selección algo memorable\n\nIntenta hacer el proceso de selección que te gustaría hacer a tí. Si cuentas con alguien de RRHH, forma una alianza con la recruiter en la que ella aportará su experiencia sobre selección y cómo tratar de una forma efectiva a cada persona y tú aportarás conocimiento técnico de las necesidades a cubrir.\n\nEscribe con cariño la descripción del puesto. Una vez identificado qué necesitas es hora de escribirlo para llamar la atención de candidatos. No hay que confundir este llamar la atención con venderles humo, sino que se identifiquen con el rol. Además una buena descripción del puesto por escrito le permitirá a tu recruitir tener suficiente información para que consiga hacer un filtrado más efectivo. [Me repito mucho](https://twitter.com/pelayoarbues/status/1273864002473517056?s=20\u0026t=Ed2hTBGHS9I0IVefG0XExg) pero el rol de DS no está bien definido así que al menos trata que en tu descripción de la posición quede claro qué funciones esperas que cubran.\n\n**Pasa un cuestionario para que lo envíen junto al CV**. Pregunta por conocimiento en tecnologías, formas de trabajo y experiencia con ellas. Insiste en qué partes del pipeline de un proyecto de DS ha tenido experiencia: obteniendo información, limpiando, modelizando y MLOps.\n\nAdemás es importante saber cómo se ha relacionado con otros grupos de interés: traduciendo necesidades de negocio a características del análisis, integración con otros sistemas y relación con otros equipos de ingeniería. En la mayoría de las ocasiones los proyectos de DS fracasan por malos enganches entre equipos y funciones, así que tener experiencia en estas situaciones puede ser muy valioso para tu equipo.\n\nEntrevista. En la entrevista insiste una y otra vez en describir el puesto y pregunta mucho al candidato sobre cómo ve la posición y cómo encajaría según su formación y experiencia para ver si realmente entiende qué está buscando la empresa.\n  \nPor ejemplo puedes contar que el equipo está haciendo la transición de trabajar de modo artesano (cada persona lleva un pipeline completo de un proyecto) a un modo factoría en el que cada perfil se especializa en aquellas funciones en las que estamos más preparados. Si el equipo está atravesando un proceso así o estás en uno u otro lado los candidatos tienen que saberlo.\n\n\u003e Da contexto sobre cómo la empresa usa el dato\n\nEn la entrevista es importante hablar de cómo es la organización de la empresa y qué papel creemos que nuestro equipo juega en ella y el recorrido que tiene por delante. Es importante describir si el equipo está [centralizado o descentralizado](https://mikkeldengsoe.substack.com/p/data-team-structure-embedded-or-centralised?), comentar el grado de madurez de la empresa a la hora de tomar decisiones basadas en datos, el papel que juegan los científicos de datos en los procesos de desarrollo de producto o si el CDO tiene capacidad de influir en las decisiones del Consejo de Dirección.\n\n\u003e Esperamos que la candidata nos haga muchas preguntas.\n\nEso para nosotros es muy buena señal. Parte del trabajo de DS es ayudar a otros equipos a hacerse las preguntas correctas, así que es un buen indicador de cómo se va a desenvolver en la resolución de problemas poco definidos.\n\n**Prueba técnica** Diseñamos una prueba para cada posición. Si entre tus funciones principales no va a estar la modelización no tiene sentido que te pidamos hacer un modelo en la prueba. En algunos puestos preferimos ver cómo tratas unos datos (cómo manejas outliers y missings), flujo de trabajo, si sacas conclusiones en base a la evidencia o la intuición, si sigues un proceso formal de inferencia, si usas buenas prácticas de desarrollo de software…\n\nPara la prueba técnica siempre he trabajado poniendo deadlines no estrictos, siendo flexibles en la fecha de entrega. Bastante es que los candidatos que están trabajando dediquen sus horas de tiempo libre a hacer una prueba como para ser muy rígido con los plazos.\n\n**Selección** Para afrontar la decisión de contratar, partimos de haber estructurado toda la información de los candidatos de la forma más eficiente posible y valorado cada uno de los aspectos que habíamos identificado como claves para el puesto. Para ellos es importante definir qué indicadores se van a valorar y tratar de guiar la puntuación de la manera más estándar posible.\n\nSobre la selección propiamente dicha: Habitualmente suele haber una convergencia de opiniones en los rankings de candidatos, pero aquí siempre hay una cuestión que me ronda: Se tiene que ir a consenso o se tiene que apostar por la persona con la que alguien del equipo realmente desea trabajar?\n\n**Da feedback a los candidatos**. Notifica a todos los candidatos la decisión sobre su candidatura. Además a aquellos que han avanzado hasta las entrevistas técnicas envíales feedback sobre cómo han realizado el proceso. Lo lógico sería que si vuelves a abrir posiciones en los meses siguientes tires de aquellas personas que han quedado top en el ranking pero no has contratado. Siempre y cuando sigan encajando en las necesidades que has identificado en los primeros pasos del proceso. El mundo del dato es muy pequeño, no quemes puentes innecesariamente.\n\nUn último apunte sobre el proceso, involucra a otros miembros del equipo. Tanto en el perfilado explícito de lo que necesitamos como en el propio proceso de selección. Te servirá para ganar perspectiva, el equipo ganará en diversidad y a ell@s para ganar experiencia en algo que algún día será su responsabilidad.\n\n## Optimiza la búsqueda\n  \nEn el pasado siempre me ha funcionado bastante bien hacer una búsqueda segmentada a través del mailing que algunas organizaciones ponen a disposición de las empresas para anunciar sus posiciones: [Spain AI](https://www.spain-ai.com/), [Comunidad de R Hispano](http://r-es.org/quenes-somos/) o [Pyladies](http://madrid.pyladies.com/) son algunos ejemplos.\n  \n\u003e Segmenta la búsqueda y usa tu red de contactos\n\nUsa tu red de contactos. Tira mucho de amigos y excompañeros en cuyo criterio confias plenamente para obtener recomendaciones. Si buscamos un perfil muy junior puedes pedir recomendaciones a colegas profesores de escuelas de formación.\n\nUna última nota. Que la gente quiera venir a trabajar a tu empresa pasa porque tengas buenas condiciones laborales, proyectos atractivos, acceso razonable a datos y espacio para crecer laboralmente. Para señalizar que tu equipo/departamento cumple estas condiciones funciona muy bien difundir tu trabajo de forma honrada en eventos y escribiendo posts en el blog corporativo.\n\nEl mercado de perfiles de datos está muy loco, así que espero que tanto si estás en un lado o en otro estas notas te sirvan.\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.526114702Z","tags":null},"/writing/Data-Science-Fundamentals":{"title":"Data Science Fundamentals","content":"\n![](writing/attachments/ebookplants.png)\n\n*Data Science Fundamentals* is a collection of selected resources aimed at providing a solid background for aspiring and junior Data Scientists. The objective is to create a list as small and powerful as possible. There are thousands of sources out there and it is sometimes difficult to focus on what's important.\n\nI am afraid to say that there is no shortcut to becoming a professional Data Scientist. I don't believe in one-month bootcamps and I find that most MS programs miss some key topics. They are usually too focused on technology and ML/DL algorithms, and often forget about other important things such as communicating results or providing a broad picture of the role of a data scientist in a project.\n\nMy main motivation is to create a comprehensive list of resources that will allow future Data Scientists to gain a deep knowledge of a few core competencies from which they can build up their careers. If you have a strong background in any of these competencies, you may still find some other useful stuff on the list. The list is alive, I want to keep it short so I could replace one course if I find something better. Competences should remain mostly the same.\n\nThe core competencies covered are:\n\n- Maths foundation: It is impossible to be successful doing a Data Science project without a solid understanding of Probability, Statistics and Linear Algebra. Machine learning might be useful to solve certain problems, but what you will always be using is statistics and algebra as a fundamental and general framework. It is the most time consuming competence to work on, but it will pay off.\n- Communication skills: You won't be working in isolation so you will need to show results, explain processes to non-technical audiences or write project proposals. Or you might just need a colleague to help you with something and you will need to explain it as clearly as possible via email or instant message. Learn to talk. Learn to write.\n- Data Science Workflow: Understand the iterative process in data science. The importance of understanding business problems. Help businesses ask the right questions to solve a problem. Identify the role of data scientists in a project.\n- Tools of the trade: You will need git, shell scripting and SQL. And a programming language. Remember that these are just tools to solve problems. Nothing else. I do not recommend learning lots of languages and tools. Stick to a shell, SQL and R/Python, and once you feel comfortable with those you can move forward and learn something else.\n- Business understanding: You will be working in a particular sector and you need to understand this context. And also the different roles in business. Also try to get an idea of why the project is important for the different departments of the company, how it will be impacting customers and Profit \u0026 Loss account.\n- Ethics: A great power comes with a great responsability. And although maybe your power is limited in scope at the beginning of your career, everyone working with data should be aware of issues such as data privacy, data ownership, anonimity, fairness and biases.\n\n## Resources\n\nThere are two levels: \n\n- Foundation flagged contents are essential to be mastered by Data Scientists.\n- Recommended items are highly useful resources but may not be essential for very junior DS.\n\n| Competence             | Name

In my experience, these tools are not essential in a common project in a common company in a common industry. Besides being niche methods, it is quite unlikely that a newcomer will be handed one of this cool projects while more senior Data Scientists are usually doing unglamorous stuff and desperately willing to land a project in which to use any of these.","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.526114702Z","tags":null},"/writing/My-failure-resume":{"title":"My failure resume","content":"\n![](writing/attachments/plant-midjourney.png)\n\nI'm a little brother, so I learned to lose as soon as I learned to crawl. I played in a youth futsal team and there was one year when we lost ALL our games. This over-exposure to defeat made me realise that I don't need to win to be happy, but I do need a context that allows me to chase victory. \n\n\u003e Don't take yourself too seriously. \n\nI have never taken myself too seriously. This way of thinking has made me very aware of my failures. I used to be aware of them and I didn't hide them, but I didn't broadcast them either. Now I'm at a stage where I think I have to be proud of those failures. Maybe it's because I've started listening to punk again, maybe it's because I reject the false perfection that's on display on social networks. Punk is, after all, a cultural response to the social context, so maybe the two are very much linked. \n\n\u003e LinkedIn, you are a very powerful professional tool, but social networking dynamics suck.\n\nI wrote this post a while ago, but I recently discovered the concept of the [failure resume](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/a-failure-resume/), so I've changed the title from My biggest fuck-ups to My Failure Resume, and I'm going to start with my most resounding failures both as a data scientist and in my most recent management position. Here they are:\n\nTop DS Failures:\n- Inability to reproduce the code and get the same results in a research paper as part of my thesis. I learnt the importance of using version control, saving intermediate results and managing development environment dependencies well.\n- Negative valuations in a production property valuation model. Yes, I could do that! That was a big relief for the people in my team. I learned the importance of model monitoring, how to analyse model behaviour when inputs take extreme values, and how to be wary of tree models.\n- Putting the engineering team in a sweat. I had to cluster users' geolocations and thought DBScan was a good fit. I did not think about the production release and availability of the library in Spark. As a consultant, I was asked to solve a problem and didn't ask about the technical context, volumetrics or anything else.\n- Business intrusion. In more than one project, I didn't know how to deal with business constraints. We delivered data of dubious quality, which reduced our credibility, and also created a huge technical debt because we were not allowed to version the reports, so you had to carry one of them around with you historically.\n\n\nTop management failures:\n- Giving too much responsibility without enough support. Asking junior people in certain roles to take on responsibility without giving them enough support. Setting them up for failure almost by design.\n- Not making sure they got the message. One of the most important things you can do as a manager is to give feedback. On a number of occasions I have sinned by not making sure that the message I was sending was fully understood.\n- I make jokes when I shouldn't. Sometimes I've been a loudmouth and made team jokes that didn't go down well with certain people.\n\nThis is my CV of mistakes so far, I'm sure I'll soon be able to add more `medals` to wear on my lapel. \n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-21T11:05:51.526114702Z","tags":null},"/writing/The-Rational-Company":{"title":"The Rational Company","content":"\nIn the past years many companies have claimed to be adopting processes that allows them to be more intensively driven by data. Although most of these companies focus on the technology and tools used, we could assume that what they are trying to do is to improve their decision making processes. We could say that they try to become rational.\n\nRationality is about more than just forming true beliefs – it's also about making decisions that help you achieve your goals. Decision making is the ability to make sound, rational decisions based on the available information. This process begins with understanding what it is that the company wants to achieve – its north star goal. Once this is clear, the company can start collecting relevant data and expertise to inform its decisions. Finally, creating a culture of lifelong learning will ensure that the company continues to get better at making decisions over time.\n\nBetter decision making might require open minded profesionals, eager to adopt a bayesian-style culture where prior beliefs are constantly updated by new facts and evidence. Being willing to change our minds when new evidence arises is important for making smart decisions – after all, if we’re always sticking to our original ideas, chances are we won’t be taking advantage of all the potential options out there. All of these qualities together – being open-minded and thinking critically about information, as well as being willing to alter our beliefs in light of new data – make for better decision making overall.\n\nIn the absence of enough data, beliefs based on experience and expert knowledge can provide a competitive advantage.  It is important for companies to have experts on their team who can rely on intuition and experience when making decisions based on insufficient information. \n\n\u003e Human beings face ever more complex and urgent problems, and their effectiveness in dealing with these problems is a matter that is critical to the stability and continued progress of society. \n\u003e \n\u003e \\- Cassie Kozyrkov, [What is Decision Intelligence](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-decision-intelligence-5d147ddab767)\n\u003e \n\nBlindly trusting data and statistics without verifying their validity is also a risk, as it could lead to incorrect decisions being made.
