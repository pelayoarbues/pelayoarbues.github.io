It did not work for small companies. Neither did it for the larger ones starting their journey in advanced analytics. In both environments, Data Scientists usually work on more than one project at a time (They can even be considered [floor sweepers](https://publish.obsidian.md/dr-mario/pages/%F0%9F%97%A3%EF%B8%8F+Down+with+Data+Science), but that is another story). In that situation, if a project running in agile has no fully dedicated team the whole system crumbles, but that is not specific to Data Science. \n\nIn this writing, I follow this great post [[Data Science and Agile (What Works, and What Doesn't)]] to keep the discussion going. \n\nData Science is not engineering, although lots can be learned from engineering good practices. There are a few characteristics of Data Science that makes it quite difficult to run under agile:\n- Not well-defined problems: Usually Product Owners, Product Managers (PMs) come with ill-defined problems. Similar objectives can be achieved with different data and very different techniques.  It might be something really specific like I need to query this data, but the ultimate objective of that query is something quite different, and it is not clear even in PMs' brains. It is usually not even clear what data to use as a similar concept can be approached from different data perspectives. Retrieving the data and running an adequacy assessment might be time-consuming and also an iterative process. In these preliminary steps, you have to reach a problem definition. \n- The science: unknown paths to be taken, difficulty to estimate the time to be spent in the different steps from one project vs another. Only a few times does the data speak by itself and you do not need to really deep dive into the details. Usually, you need time to grasp the quality and fit of the data to solve the question. The question, goal, and paths taken usually evolve as the analysis is running, so you need to change the scope. Although you have a well-defined DS workflow and process, the amount of effort at each step may vary between projects. \n- Research question: Related to the science it is the idea that Agile ceremonies push you to make a bet and put your efforts to solve a goal. Agile is supposed to be a methodology that allows you to pivot from one particular topic to other, so you should be able to move forward easily. The truth is that maybe the data indicates that the current goal is unfeasible and pushes you to a very different scenario. In my experience Agile lacks of general perspective and as Fabien Girardin says in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/fabiengirardin/status/1526806791157317632?s=20\u0026t=XoK9T69e8lH0SIcNHdwo5g), it does not help you asking if you are asking the wrong question. \n![[Pasted image 20221117094216.png]]\n- Deliverables: Data Science is not engineering. For a PM it may be natural to think that if they can ask a software engineer for a new feature, she can do the same to a Data Scientist. Sometimes DS deliverables are difficult to be defined in advance during sprint planning. A successful DS deliverable might be an analysis or discovery that works as input for the next step in the DS workflow. It is quite likely that this output does not fit the definition of something usable for the end-user and that may be reported upwards. Sometimes a DS deliverable might be something as discouraging as data quality issues. \n- It hurdles DS innovation. Data Science has a really large potential of transforming companies. DS can optimize the company's performance by tweaking processes. These sorts of tasks are important but lead to incremental improvements, not exponential changes. Innovation may happen when  DS follows data trails without a clear purpose. \n\nWhat I like about agile\n- Clear priorities with deliverables: A desirable skill of Data Scientists is curiosity. However, DS should know when to tame their curiosity and when they have to chase it even if it leads them to rabbit holes.  Sprint planning and execution create an environment that ensures the DS is focused on delivering specific outcomes. \n- Short deadlines: A short deadline keeps your feet on the ground and pushes you to use the most simple techniques. Moreover, having a time budget helps you define feasible solutions. \n- Deliverables focused on the ultimate objective. Reminds me of a problem-solving technique of the  [climber's technique](https://giorgionardone.com/en/strategic-logic-and-problem-solving/). This technique allows you to untangle a complex problem and set micro objectives that you can go solving. \n\nManaging Data Science projects is difficult because of the complicated nature of data challenges, the innate curiosity of Data Scientists, and the usual lack of a mature data culture in the company. Experiment and be flexible and try to accommodate the method to the project and the people involved. Don't fall in love with a methodology, tweak it to make it work for you. \n\n\nAndrew Ng take on the differences between ML systems and software systems in its newsletter The batch:\n\"We don’t know how accurate the system will be in advance. \nWe might need a costly initial data collection phase.\nAfter getting the initial dataset, we might come back and ask for more data or better data. \nMoreover, we might ask for this over and over. \nAfter we’ve built a prototype that runs accurately in the lab, it might not run as well in production because of data drift or concept drift. \nEven after we’ve built an accurate production system, its performance might get worse over time for no obvious reason. We might need help monitoring the system and, if its performance degrades over time, invest further to fix it. \nA system might exhibit biases that are hard to detect.\nIt might be hard to figure out why the system gave a particular output. We didn’t explicitly program it to do that! \"\"\n\n\nA really interesting take on Agile is in this [[Agile and the long crisis of software]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T22:54:09.510471192Z","tags":null},"/01.-Slip-box/202205031105-Buscas-tu-primer-empleo-de-Ciencia-de-Datos":{"title":"202205031105 - Buscas tu primer empleo de Ciencia de Datos?","content":"\nDesde junio de 2020 cada semana trato de tener una conversación con personas desconocidas que me contactan para charlar conmigo sobre distintos temas relacionados con el mundo de los datos. La mayoría de las charlas son con perfiles junior que no tienen claro cómo empezar/formarse o que quieren empezar/hacer la transición a un puesto de Ciencia de datos.\n\n  \n\nEstas conversaciones me aportan mucho pero sobre todo me han ayudado a ser más sensible a la distinta velocidad a la que va el mercado de Data Scientists según la experiencia del candidato. Según testimonios sacados de estas conversaciones, y de otras mantenidas con gente de mi red, entre los años 2015 y 2019 un Data Scientist sin apenas experiencia lograba encontrar y aterrizar en posiciones abiertas sin mucha dificultad. A partir de ese año empiezo a observar que el proceso de entrar a un primer empleo comienza a ser algo más difícil. Esto se debe principalmente a la proliferación de formaciones en Data Science que han dado lugar a una bolsa grande de aspirantes que compiten de manera intensa por su primera posición.\n\n  \n\nAsí, en 2022 nos encontramos en una situación en la que los candidatos noveles a posiciones de Data Scientist no encuentran empleo tan rápidamente como esperaban. Desde las escuelas de formación se bombardea a los alumnos (clientes) con cifras sobre la falta de perfiles de datos y los altos sueldos que se ganan en el oficio. Esto es cierto, pero sólo en parte, ya que esa falta de perfiles actualmente se refiere a perfiles con cierta experiencia (sobre todo en cuanto a poner soluciones en producción y con impacto en el negocio) o perfiles muy especializados (expertos en NLP, bioestadística o Computer Vision)\n\n  \n\nNo eres tú, es el mercado.\n\n  \n\nEn muchas de esas conversaciones hablamos de esa frustración que provoca este desencuentro entre las expectativas del candidato y su experiencia en el proceso de búsqueda de empleo. Una de los primeros mensajes que envío es el mismo que he desarrollado en los parrafos anteriores: no eres tú, es el mercado. Creo que es importante que la persona entienda que pese a los cantos de sirena de abundancia de empleo y sueldo para estos perfiles, le toca competir con muchos otros en su misma situación y que no es tanto una cuestión de si valgo/no valgo para este trabajo.\n\n  \n\nY a partir de entender esta realidad el siguiente paso que aconsejo en esa situación es construir una estrategia. A lo que me refiero es que esa búsqueda de primer empleo puedes orientarla de determinadas maneras. Una estrategia puede ser aplicar a todo lo que lleve el título relacionado con Data Science. Una estrategia alternativa puede ser optimizar tu búsqueda aplicando únicamente a aquello que creas que mejor se ajusta a tu perfil y expectativas.\n\n  \n\n\u003e Aplicar a todos los puestos de Data Scientist puede no ser tu estrategia óptima\n\n  \n\nLa mayoría de las personas con las que hablo siguen la estrategia de disparar a todo lo que se mueve. No tiene porque ser mala estrategia a corto plazo, pero si no te funciona rápido puedes acabar sepultado en pruebas técnicas y procesos eternos con todo el estrés que conlleva. Creo que es importante que los candidatos se enfrenten al proceso de búsqueda con una estrategia explícita y de esa manera poder evaluarla y ajustarla a las valoraciones que reciban. Una estrategia tipo que suelo plantear, a modo de ejemplo es la siguiente:\n\n  \n\n1. **Análisis de fortalezas/debilidades**\n\nEl primer paso es muy evidente pero no todo el mundo lo hace. Quizás lo más importante sea dedicar cierta reflexión de las condiciones iniciales de las que se parte. Si su formación/experiencia es Ciencias Sociales (hello my fellow economists) posiblemente sea razonablemente fuerte en análisis de datos, pensamiento analítico, modelización, estadística y causalidad. Para aquellos candidatos que vienen de carreras más técnicas/posiciones de ingeniería es muy posible que su fuerte sea conocimiento de algoritmos, computación, eficiencia de código, buenas prácticas en desarrollo de software y conocimientos de tecnología. Simplificando mucho entre estos dos tipos de perfiles podríamos asumir en términos generales que las fortalezas de uno son las debilidades del otro, aunque lo cierto es que cada persona tiene que hacer este análisis de manera cruda sobre su propio perfil. Y cuando digo cruda me refiero a que si has dado una clase de SQL, una introducción a la estadística o un modulo de Deep Learning no te puedes considerar experto en esas herramientas.\n\n  \n\n2. **Búsqueda de posiciones que mejor se ajusten a tus fortalezas/debilidades**\n\nUna vez tengas claras las capacidades/carencias que tienes, toca identificar las oportunidades laborales. Aquí lo primero a tener en cuenta es que Data Science es un [término paraguas](https://scientistemily.substack.com/p/save-data-science?s=w). Esto significa que la gente cuando dice Data Science se refiere a a multitud de posiciones y además su significado no es estándar. Dentro de Data Science puedes encontrar puestos cercanos a Data Engineer, Data Analyst, ML Engineer, DataOps y cada empresa tiene su propia definición. Una manera de maximizar tu probabilidad de encontrar un primer puesto es orientarte hacia aquellos que más se ajustan a tus habilidades. ¿Suena razonable, no? La mala noticia es que, además de no diferenciar en el nombre la posición, las descripciones de las ofertas en Data Science parecen haber sido fotocopiadas unas de otras. Aunque haya poca señal en la descripción, el aspirante siempre puede minar algo de información y lo mismo ocurre durante las primeras etapas del proceso. En esas primeras entrevistas con RRHH o la persona responsable del proceso, hay que ser muy proactivo en tratar de discernir qué tipo de funciones está la empresa tratando de cubrir. En esta búsqueda de posiciones hay que considerar que, si nuestro objetivo es acabar alcanzando una posición de Data Scientist, podemos llegar a ese puesto pasando primero por una posición cercana. Así suelo recomendar a la gente con formación y experiencia menos técnica que intenten primero encontrar posiciones de Data Analysts o posiciones tituladas de Data Science pero con más contenido de Analítica de datos. Como Data Analyst es muy probable que estes mucho menos expuesto a problemas ingenieriles pero vas a estar mucho más pegado al negocio lo cual puede ser una experiencia fundamental en él exito de tu carrera en el mundo de los datos. Los perfiles más ingenieriles pueden comenzar como Data Engineers y esto les va a permitir ganar mucha autonomía en la preparación del dato para futuros proyectos de Ciencia de Datos. Lo que quiero decir es que dar un rodeo puede ser una buena manera de alcanzar el objetivo y que además puede suponer una experiencia muy enriquecedora para los candidatos, así que es una opción a tener en cuenta en la estrategia. Además una vez que estás dentro es posible que surjan oportunidades para que participes en proyectos de los que te apetece hacer.\n\n  \n\n3. **Exhibición de tus habilidades en el proceso de selección y autocrítica**\n\nPor último, una vez ya en el proceso de selección hay que saber demostrar tus fortalezas. Así ante una prueba o entrevista técnica los perfiles más analíticos deberían demostrar sus habilidades en pensamiento crítico, visualización de datos y cómo hacer útil el análisis para el negocio. Para ser más concreto, de este tipo de perfiles me espero que trabajen muy bien el dato que se les pase haga un EDA exhaustivo, identifiquen problemas en la calidad del dato y hagan una buena discusión acerca de los valores faltantes y atípicos. Por su parte los perfiles más técnicos deberán demostrar su capacidad para desarrollar librerías que puedan ser reutilizables por otros DS o en otros proyectos, aplicando buenas prácticas en el desarrollo del software y teniendo en cuenta temas como la complejidad computacional y la eficiencia del código.\n\n  \n\nCon este ejemplo de estrategia lo único que pretendo es indicar a los candidatos que es importante que [analicen sus condiciones, las soluciones que han intentado y no han funcionado y que replanteen sus objetivos](https://elpeoncoronado.com/problem-solving-estrategico/). Vamos, nada que no esté ya inventado. A lo largo de mi carrera he aplicado estrategias diferentes. Así cuando hice la transición del mundo académico a la industria mis primeros intentos consistían en tirar a todo lo que se movía. Mi estrategia buscaba aprender cómo eran los procesos de selección y qué solían buscar las empresas. En el camino coseché sonoros rechazos en empresas en las que me hubiera encantado trabajar, pero creo que en todos los procesos aprendí algo que me ayudó a mejorar en siguientes oportunidades. Según voy desenmascarando mis carencias en el propio puesto de trabajo busco nuevas posiciones que me permiten crecer en aquellos aspectos en los que tengo maś recorrido.\n\n  \n\n\u003e \"Goals are for Losers\" - Scott Adams.\n\n  \n\nAl final, como dice [Scott Adams](https://www.scottadamssays.com/goals-vs-systems/) es mejor tener sistemas a ponerse objetivos, y mi sistema consiste en exponerme a trabajos y funciones que no se hacer [todavía](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/the-power-of-yet/) y que me resultan estimulantes. Si todavía no has logrado conseguir tu primer empleo de DS espero que estas reflexiones te sirvan para no desesperar y para darle una pensada a tu proceso de búsqueda.\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T22:54:09.510471192Z","tags":null},"/01.-Slip-box/202205171305-Toma-de-decisiones-con-y-sin-vuelta-atr%C3%A1s":{"title":"202205171305 - Toma de decisiones con y sin vuelta atrás","content":"\n# Toma de decisiones con y sin vuelta atrás\n\nAntes de tomar una decisión deberíamos de analizar la misma y metadecidir si esa decisión es reversible o no irreversible.\n\nEs un modelo mental [propuesto por Bezos en Amazon]([[Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos This Is How Successful People Make Such Smart Decisions]]) para saber cuándo una decisión debe tomarse rápidamente o si hay que hacer un análisis en profundidad. \n\nMuchas decisiones irreversibles son tomadas de manera irracional impulsadas por la necesidad [tener la sensación de estar en control de tu vida]([[Dejar el trabajo es el nuevo divorciarte de tu pareja a los 40 y hacerte 'runner']]). \n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T22:54:09.510471192Z","tags":null},"/01.-Slip-box/202210140810-Data-Science-wishful-thinking":{"title":"202210140810 - Data Science wishful thinking","content":"\nMy favourite stage at the DS process is thinking about what data would be ideal to solve a particular problem.\n\nThis is an abstract and theoretical moment when you can be as creative as you want. Forget about data silos, infrastructure problems or data quality issues. It is a wishlist. You can order whatever you want.\n\nI like doing this process in isolation, just letting my mind wander and flow. In my opinion, this is probably one of the most creative and fun parts of the project because you have no constraints, except your own knowledge about your sector or the process at stake. And that's is also another reason that this is a fabulous moment as it allows you to test your own knowledge. \n\n\nBut at some point I will get stuck and that's when I go into the next step of this early stage of a project. Truth is that most of our work is optimization, in many cases we aim to make some processes more automatic so it is likely that there is someone who has been working in that task before you arrived to the organization. So at this point you go and talk to people, sometimes people you have never heard of if you are in a big company. And it is also a quite remarkable moment in the project, because you will be learning more about your domain and you start gazing the purpose of your work: make someone's life a bit better so that the business machine keeps oiled and running. \n\nDon't fool yourself, talking to people and trying to extract information of how they work usually takes way longer than you thought. If you are facing a complicated project you should be starting to think how to make  this new long term relationship as successful as possible. And probably is by keeping them informed about your advances and frustrations.\n\nBefore going deeper and start reading scientific papers and blog posts by companies who have faced similar challenges, I like chatting to my colleagues. At this point you are usually quite confident about what the ideal data looks like, as you have devoted some hours of your time to think about the problem. However, every time that I do this I find that my colleague points to an hole in my ideal dataset and proposes something new and smart. \n\nRead papers, blogs and so on. Try to read between the lines in that tech giant post that brag about how good they are solving the challenge you are facing. Rate the papers you have read in terms of potential and effort required. \n\nOnce you have this list of  features you have to think about the MVD minimum viable dataset. Let's get tactic. We all start by inspecting data lakes and warehouses in search of data. But keep in mind that in many occasions data creation is superior to data extraction. Data is not like oil in the sense that data can be explicitly created to solve a problem.\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T22:54:09.510471192Z","tags":null},"/01.-Slip-box/202210141110-Como-contratar-DS-y-no-desesperar":{"title":"202210141110 - Como contratar DS y no desesperar","content":"\nA raíz de la [anterior publicación](https://pelayoarbues.netlify.app/post/buscas-tu-primer-empleo/) sobre cómo conseguir un primer empleo de Data Scientist recibí bastantes preguntas de managers con dudas sobre cómo afrontar el proceso de contratación. En este artículo comparto unas notas rápidas que pueden servir para analizar si el proceso que lideras es todo lo racional que debería.\n\n  \n\nAntes de empezar un pequeño aviso: Desde que me incorporé al mundo del dato en el sector privado hace unos 7 años he participado de manera activa en la contratación de unos 15 perfiles de Data Scientist (DS), así que tampoco tengo un historial enorme de contrataciones.\n\n  \n\n## Fortalezas/debilidades del equipo y diversidad\n\n  \n\nLo habitual es que los equipos de DS tengan menos personal del necesario para afrontar los proyectos. En esta circunstancia es tentador pescar rápidamente a la primera persona que aparezca y que sea suficientemente buena, esté disponible y con ganas.\n\n  \n\nSi lo haces así, posiblemente estés obviando que esa persona no es exactamente lo que necesitas. Como dice [Julie Zhuo](https://twitter.com/joulee), autora de [The Making of a Manager](https://fellow.app/blog/management/julie-zhuo-the-making-of-a-manager/), es como cuando tienes hambre para cenar: cualquier cosa te puede valer, pero seguramente si hubieses planificado tu cena comerías algo mejor.\n\n  \n\n\u003e Analiza necesidades presentes y futuras\n\n  \n\nPara eso te tienes que tomar tu tiempo para identificar qué proyectos hay a la vista, qué líneas se abrirán en el futuro, en qué habilidades el equipo es fuerte/débil y qué personalidades y experiencias añaden diversidad a la hora de afrontar problemas.\n\n  \n\nSi haces este ejercicio es posible que te des cuenta de que no necesitas un DS, que lo que en realidad necesitas es un Data Engineer (o dos). O que quizás ya tienes suficientes economistas varones blancos. O que necesitas una DS que sea más ingeniera ([Tipo B](https://medium.com/@jamesdensmore/there-are-two-types-of-data-scientists-and-two-types-of-problems-to-solve-a149a0148e64)) que analista (Tipo A).\n\n  \n\n## Haz del proceso de selección algo memorable\n\n  \n\nIntenta hacer el proceso de selección que te gustaría hacer a tí. Si cuentas con alguien de RRHH, forma una alianza con la recruiter en la que ella aportará su experiencia sobre selección y cómo tratar de una forma efectiva a cada persona y tú aportarás conocimiento técnico de las necesidades a cubrir.\n\n  \n\nEscribe con cariño la descripción del puesto. Una vez identificado qué necesitas es hora de escribirlo para llamar la atención de candidatos. No hay que confundir este llamar la atención con venderles humo, sino que se identifiquen con el rol. Además una buena descripción del puesto por escrito le permitirá a tu recruitir tener suficiente información para que consiga hacer un filtrado más efectivo. [Me repito mucho](https://twitter.com/pelayoarbues/status/1273864002473517056?s=20\u0026t=Ed2hTBGHS9I0IVefG0XExg) pero el rol de DS no está bien definido así que al menos trata que en tu descripción de la posición quede claro qué funciones esperas que cubran.\n\n  \n\n**Pasa un cuestionario para que lo envíen junto al CV**. Pregunta por conocimiento en tecnologías, formas de trabajo y experiencia con ellas. Insiste en qué partes del pipeline de un proyecto de DS ha tenido experiencia: obteniendo información, limpiando, modelizando y MLOps.\n\n  \n\nAdemás es importante saber cómo se ha relacionado con otros grupos de interés: traduciendo necesidades de negocio a características del análisis, integración con otros sistemas y relación con otros equipos de ingeniería. En la mayoría de las ocasiones los proyectos de DS fracasan por malos enganches entre equipos y funciones, así que tener experiencia en estas situaciones puede ser muy valioso para tu equipo.\n\n  \n\nEntrevista. En la entrevista insiste una y otra vez en describir el puesto y pregunta mucho al candidato sobre cómo ve la posición y cómo encajaría según su formación y experiencia para ver si realmente entiende qué está buscando la empresa.\n\n  \n\nPor ejemplo puedes contar que el equipo está haciendo la transición de trabajar de modo artesano (cada persona lleva un pipeline completo de un proyecto) a un modo factoría en el que cada perfil se especializa en aquellas funciones en las que estamos más preparados. Si el equipo está atravesando un proceso así o estás en uno u otro lado los candidatos tienen que saberlo.\n\n  \n\n\u003e Da contexto sobre cómo la empresa usa el dato\n\n  \n\nEn la entrevista es importante hablar de cómo es la organización de la empresa y qué papel creemos que nuestro equipo juega en ella y el recorrido que tiene por delante. Es importante describir si el equipo está [centralizado o descentralizado](https://mikkeldengsoe.substack.com/p/data-team-structure-embedded-or-centralised?), comentar el grado de madurez de la empresa a la hora de tomar decisiones basadas en datos, el papel que juegan los científicos de datos en los procesos de desarrollo de producto o si el CDO tiene capacidad de influir en las decisiones del Consejo de Dirección.\n\n  \n\n\u003e Esperamos que la candidata nos haga muchas preguntas.\n\n  \n\nEso para nosotros es muy buena señal. Parte del trabajo de DS es ayudar a otros equipos a hacerse las preguntas correctas, así que es un buen indicador de cómo se va a desenvolver en la resolución de problemas poco definidos.\n\n  \n\n**Prueba técnica** Diseñamos una prueba para cada posición. Si entre tus funciones principales no va a estar la modelización no tiene sentido que te pidamos hacer un modelo en la prueba. En algunos puestos preferimos ver cómo tratas unos datos (cómo manejas outliers y missings), flujo de trabajo, si sacas conclusiones en base a la evidencia o la intuición, si sigues un proceso formal de inferencia, si usas buenas prácticas de desarrollo de software…\n\n  \n\nPara la prueba técnica siempre he trabajado poniendo deadlines no estrictos, siendo flexibles en la fecha de entrega. Bastante es que los candidatos que están trabajando dediquen sus horas de tiempo libre a hacer una prueba como para ser muy rígido con los plazos.\n\n  \n\n**Selección** Para afrontar la decisión de contratar, partimos de haber estructurado toda la información de los candidatos de la forma más eficiente posible y valorado cada uno de los aspectos que habíamos identificado como claves para el puesto. Para ellos es importante definir qué indicadores se van a valorar y tratar de guiar la puntuación de la manera más estándar posible.\n\n  \n\nSobre la selección propiamente dicha: Habitualmente suele haber una convergencia de opiniones en los rankings de candidatos, pero aquí siempre hay una cuestión que me ronda: Se tiene que ir a consenso o se tiene que apostar por la persona con la que alguien del equipo realmente desea trabajar?\n\n  \n\n**Da feedback a los candidatos**. Notifica a todos los candidatos la decisión sobre su candidatura. Además a aquellos que han avanzado hasta las entrevistas técnicas envíales feedback sobre cómo han realizado el proceso. Lo lógico sería que si vuelves a abrir posiciones en los meses siguientes tires de aquellas personas que han quedado top en el ranking pero no has contratado. Siempre y cuando sigan encajando en las necesidades que has identificado en los primeros pasos del proceso. El mundo del dato es muy pequeño, no quemes puentes innecesariamente.\n\n  \n\nUn último apunte sobre el proceso, involucra a otros miembros del equipo. Tanto en el perfilado explícito de lo que necesitamos como en el propio proceso de selección. Te servirá para ganar perspectiva, el equipo ganará en diversidad y a ell@s para ganar experiencia en algo que algún día será su responsabilidad.\n\n  \n\n## Optimiza la búsqueda\n\n  \n\nEn el pasado siempre me ha funcionado bastante bien hacer una búsqueda segmentada a través del mailing que algunas organizaciones ponen a disposición de las empresas para anunciar sus posiciones: [Spain AI](https://www.spain-ai.com/), [Comunidad de R Hispano](http://r-es.org/quenes-somos/) o [Pyladies](http://madrid.pyladies.com/) son algunos ejemplos.\n\n  \n\n\u003e Segmenta la búsqueda y usa tu red de contactos\n\n  \n\nUsa tu red de contactos. Tira mucho de amigos y excompañeros en cuyo criterio confias plenamente para obtener recomendaciones. Si buscamos un perfil muy junior puedes pedir recomendaciones a colegas profesores de escuelas de formación.\n\n  \n\nUna última nota. Que la gente quiera venir a trabajar a tu empresa pasa porque tengas buenas condiciones laborales, proyectos atractivos, acceso razonable a datos y espacio para crecer laboralmente. Para señalizar que tu equipo/departamento cumple estas condiciones funciona muy bien difundir tu trabajo de forma honrada en eventos y escribiendo posts en el blog corporativo.\n\n  \n\nEl mercado de perfiles de datos está muy loco, así que espero que tanto si estás en un lado o en otro estas notas te sirvan.\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T22:54:09.510471192Z","tags":null},"/01.-Slip-box/202210141310-Data-is-not-objective":{"title":"202210141310 - Data is not objective","content":"\nData has always been obtained with instruments and techniques that impose a particular structure to the information we aim to study.

Although most of these companies focus on the technology and tools used, we could assume that what they are trying to do is to improve their decision making processes. We could say that they try to become rational.\n\nRationality is about more than just forming true beliefs – it's also about making decisions that help you achieve your goals. Decision making is the ability to make sound, rational decisions based on the available information. This process begins with understanding what it is that the company wants to achieve – its north star goal. Once this is clear, the company can start collecting relevant data and expertise to inform its decisions. Finally, creating a culture of lifelong learning will ensure that the company continues to get better at making decisions over time.\n\nBetter decision making might require open minded profesionals, eager to adopt a bayesian-style culture where prior beliefs are constantly updated by new facts and evidence. Being willing to change our minds when new evidence arises is important for making smart decisions – after all, if we’re always sticking to our original ideas, chances are we won’t be taking advantage of all the potential options out there. All of these qualities together – being open-minded and thinking critically about information, as well as being willing to alter our beliefs in light of new data – make for better decision making overall.\n\nIn the absence of enough data, beliefs based on experience and expert knowledge can provide a competitive advantage.  important it is for companies to have experts on their team who can rely on intuition and experience when making decisions based on insufficient information. \n\n**Strategies purely based on mathematical rationality without a qualitative understanding of decision-making and human behaviour tend to underperform.** [[What is Decision Intelligence#The trouble with your brain]]\n\nBlindly trusting data and statistics without verifying their validity is also a risk, as it could lead to incorrect decisions being made. By using Bayesian reasoning techniques, businesses can mitigate these risks and optimise their operations accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T22:54:09.510471192Z","tags":null},"/01.-Slip-box/202210201510-Uplift-Modeling":{"title":"202210201510 - Uplift Modeling","content":"\nUplift modeling tries to capture the difference in the propensity of a subject to performa an action if they have received an intervention vs not receiving the intervention.\n\n\"As an example, consider a marketing campaign where customers are sent offers in order to persuade them to purchase a product. In this example, there is a binary treatment (i.e. the customer can either receive the offer or not) and a binary objective (i.e. the customer can either purchase or not). The uplift is the probability of purchasing (if they receive the offer) **minus** the probability of purchasing (if they _do not_ receive the offer). This difference in probabilities is important, because the goal of uplift modeling in such a campaign is to avoid sending offers to customers who would have purchased it anyway.\" [[How uplift modeling works  Blogs]]\n\n![[Pasted image 20221020114342.png]]\n\nUplift modeling for a particular individual cannot be measured directly, only estimated based on groups o similar customers.

While this base-level version of search is sometimes still utilized in simpler applications, for the most part, the results from queries that users perform are personalized to them, in order to surface documents that are more likely to be relevant to the user’s interests. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr7cmdy4k6dpj27gwt3e45kq))\n- Search engines have typically relied on a reverse index-based information retrieval system, which maps individual words or terms in the documents or records, and helps drastically reduce the candidate sets by several orders of magnitude. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr7f85n2q72jjtpvkn0w62qs))\n- Elasticsearch stores data in an index and searches the inverted indices for query terms when a query is submitted. When a match for the query term is found, the corresponding document is returned. Breaking down the documents and identifying them by their key terms allows for faster retrieval of results. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr7f8m2p7yytwzctc25xq2ax))\n- Semantic Retrieval\n  While there are many ways to perform semantic retrieval, TTSN with BERT is frequently used in combination with KNN indices when working with personalized search. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr7ck3qah9qmzhb659nm4d0n))\n- For personalized search, a KNN index is used to model the user's interests and preferences, based on the user's past search queries and the search results that the user has clicked on (which are modeled by the TTSN).

This platform product manager role was not in fact managing one product, but instead the 4-5 separate products that comprised the platform. It was only once I dug into that level of detail that I felt I could fully describe the role. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqd68y4kx0ewrxjgr3768dxs))\n- My point in writing this is to elevate the importance of discussing *if* something should become a data product. It is really tempting to automate everything, to democratize a capability, so to speak. It is much harder to say “I don’t think that’s the right investment for us, let’s keep doing it more manually.” But for many companies and organizations, that might be the right answer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkjqbzgqystsdg1pfpvda1))\n- Let’s put aside the idea of persona, user needs, understanding the business problem and getting stakeholder buy-in. While those are hugely important for creating a useful data product, I’ve previously written about the pitfalls of not accounting for these components in a careful, methodical way. Instead, here are a few situations where the design of the product itself (more backend than frontend for now) is the bottleneck for growth and adoption of the product. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkmdk03sy2xehh7qh39s75))\n- In these newsletters, I typically try to include 5 points or things to think about. But today, I’ve just got one: look at the product you are responsible for. Look at the list of things you wish could be better about it. Then cut that list down to 1 thing. Yes, just one. It might not have anything to do with improving the data and everything to do with the product experience itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkrj1qqvb7nazgsy5x45kp))\n- Why am I taking the time to say all of this? Because the key to being a data product manager is knowing when it isn’t all about the data. At some point, you may get no improvement from technical enhancements. In the coming 12-24 months, we’ll only get to do fewer things, not more. It won’t be all about the data, even if your job is to own a data product. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkrvyhf5h8jt09kjs7715y))\n- *Personas* are general representations of a user or customer. We build personas to represent different user types and characteristics of those users that use the product we build in a consistent or similar way. People are *not* personas. An individual person is full of nuances and unique background, intentions and training. We need to actively create personas, we do not just “find them”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkt8bcdj79sfjbakw6mawx))\n- This desire to help without thinking about personas is exactly where data products go off the rails. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdktv31fy6vr2hcvch6j3d2))\n- The builders of the data products are well intentioned. They are trying to do their best. They are listening to customers. It just happens to be the customers they are listening to are the loudest in the room and often those they are most familiar or comfortable with in the organization. We need to work actively against this tendency. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkv8s5j0rkpb812yda0mhe))\n- Spend time defining the key personas in your organization that use or are impacted by data products. It is much easier to define these personas upfront that do it in an intense moment of planning or prioritization where time and patience are often much lower in availability. If you have these personas and socialize them in your company, you’ll be much better off when it comes to hard decisions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkvdfm67ktvrn8hgvd27n2))\n- Push actively against the “Person X wants us to build Product Y” mentality. Many organizations I have been a part of justify product decisions with a name of someone who wants it, rather than the personas that they product actually serves. Specific people and decision makers are temporary at companies, but personas are long lasting. Ask about the persona. This is where having the personas laid out already pays off. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkw6zsve17exmjywwf48er))\n- It sounds simple to say focus on the persona. But power structures in an organization are a very real thing. It is hard for a data scientist or product manager to tell a VP that the product doesn’t clearly address a persona. This is where leadership matters a great deal. If you want to see change in this space, it cannot just be put on individual contributors. Leadership needs to sponsor these ideas and these processes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdkwnmtrst7s3vzbx5x7zd4))\n- If your company deprioritizes an area of investment, think about how your product investment should reflect that (or not). It is really common for a company to pivot investment in an “area” (which might be a key persona for your product) but the rest of the company does not quickly update to reflect that pivot. Specifically, you might have close relationships with key stakeholders who tell you “yeah, that isn’t important to the company, but I need it to do my job.” Be very wary of this type of situation. By focusing on people, it is easy to get confused about “what matters”. By focusing on where the company is headed and how different personas are part of that, it is easier to think less through the lens of working relationships and more through where the company needs to go.

This leaves you with a choice between shifting right to hard and high-impact or shifting down to easy and low-impact. The latter choice--easy and low-impact--is what Walk refers to as *snacking*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gryntktdj6bnf6wzyhw42acv))\n- When you're busy, these snacks give a sense of accomplishment that makes them psychologically rewarding. Still, you're unlikely to learn much from doing them, others are likely equally capable of completing them (*and* for some of them, it might be a good development opportunity), and there's a tremendous opportunity cost versus doing something higher impact. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grynvgdsndf2q85kc66qvf1q))\n- It's ok to spend some of your time on snacks to keep yourself motivated between bigger accomplishments, but you have to keep yourself honest about how much time you're spending on high-impact work versus low-impact work. In senior roles, you're more likely to self-determine your work, and if you're not deliberately tracking your work, it's easy to catch yourself doing little to no high-impact work.

For example, where perform code quality analysis and how to carry out rudimentary code quality analysis in that environment, where to manage modeling activities, and how to carry out common model management tasks in that environment? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs3nphjm8n4b8yanscgr3tvk))\n- The intrinsic cognitive relates to fundamental skills in a stream-aligned ML team and should be handled through hiring, training, pair/mob programming, hackathon, etc. The reduction efforts of such loads should be driven by engineering/data science/analyst managers. The germane cognitive load relates to advanced tasks in a stream-aligned team and can be reduced through sufficient opportunity to work on such problems and review support by experts. However, extraneous cognitive load relates to routine superfluous MLOps tasks that add little value in retaining working memory. Most of these relate to platform management.

Many data teams aren’t doing this as well as they could and are missing out on a huge opportunity, both for the organization and the team. This gap is due to teams not being set up for success, which undermines trust in the data and the insights the team generates ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcqp282z1gj2jb4nbn69vxd))\n- Service-oriented data teams aren’t effective\n  Most data teams aren’t set up for success. For many years, data teams have been buried in the IT function. Like IT functions, those data teams handled getting data out of their systems and presenting them to the stakeholder as CSVs from which the stakeholders could work their magic and come up with conclusions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcqps1727gmvdb2ma0d0czt))\n- submit a ticket with a question, get a very specific answer” mindset.

It is the collection of every piece of data, and the tools used to generate, access, and analyze that data, within an organization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcqvtp6neas9fmjns3r14wp))\n- Every internal tool or app that gives people the ability to generate, access, and analyze data is also a part of the Data Product. These can be thought of as “features” of the Data Product. A simple heuristic is this: if people are using it to make decisions, then it’s a feature of the Data Product ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcqwgyj0m82an06bbxf0sd0))\n- The data and associated features have limited meaning and value within their own silo, but [when integrated together within the Data Product](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/11/04/three-levels-data-analysis/), then superlinear value can be revealed. With this mindset, the data team’s role grows to include building and guiding the strategy and features of the Data Product. And because you’re building a product, you can take all of the best practices of product-led organizations to dramatically increase the value of the Data Team to the organization ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcsh46ajze5btzeq2w5js1n))\n- When moving your Data Team to the product model, you should expect some pushback from other people in the organization. As a leader you must have strong 2-way communication. This will require a great deal of empathy as you’ll have to constantly balance the need to share your vision and goals with the need to integrate the feedback from your users (colleagues). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcsq5yzjg6zd5jtp6q4df3w))\n- continually communicate what you’re working on, what you’re *not* working on, and why you’ve made these decisions in order to bring your stakeholders along on the journey.

If you have a strong foundation of 2-way communication, it is worthwhile to align with your stakeholders on what that measurement looks like to them; for example, what KPIs is your team supporting and how are your initiatives supporting them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqctsvj8mmb0x8549bxnxymz))\n- Write this definition in a team handbook and visit it frequently. Build a culture of continuous documentation so you’re regularly aligning with your business stakeholders. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqctt4nwk88f3763vb8y9xr2))\n- With a strong user focus, 2-way communication, and a solid definition of success, you can start to drive business impact through better decisions by using many of the tactics of product management. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcttmg25rzysns1gsh7txq6))\n- user stories and other tactics should be deployed in such a way that you and your Data Team are focused on deeply understanding what your colleagues are trying to do.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpz5q4m5c15tbwd0pqzt55w))\n- It’s much more work to maintain values than to create them, and adding to the company values will allow you to share the maintenance across the executive team. If it’s not widely applicable, then you have the choice between adding either engineering organizational values or engineering leadership values.

(If you want to change company behavior, change the behavior first, and document it second.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grq0da0fwjwcpwd7t32ft3x7))\n- While you should try to avoid useless values, as long as they’re honest, they tend to be inert rather than harmful, so I wouldn’t spend too much time fighting against, particularly them if you’re working on values as a participant (e.g. for the company) rather than as the final decider (e.g. for engineering). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grq0nqajnkwxx6hd92g55hqb))\n- The best way to think of the relationship between values and a strategy (business, technology, or otherwise) is that useful values generally can serve as a strategy’s guiding principle. Not all guiding principles are values (e.g. how you respond to a current market opportunity is unlikely to be a value), but most values are viable guiding principles. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grq0pev7118dw6a0k183bhme))\n- Establishing values should follow [the general patterns of good process rollout](https://lethain.com/good-process-is-evolved/): identify the opportunity, document potential options, involve stakeholders early to build buy-in, test before finalizing to avoid folks feeling trapped, and iterate until it’s useful. It’s easy to announce values, but much harder to introduce values that get used. Reduce that risk by including the wider team, listening, and iterating a few times to make them feel like a shared creation rather than a top-down one.

Engineers have dealt with analogous problems for decades. In World War II, the US designed Sherman tank used highly interchangeable parts. If one tank was knocked out, parts could be taken from another [1]. The Sherman was a relatively simple machine, if it was damaged in battle it could be quickly repaired in the field [2].\n  On the other hand, Germany designed the Tiger. The Tiger was powerful, precise and complicated [2]. It was a tank as finely tuned as a Swiss watch. Allied forces deeply feared a fully operational Tiger. The problem was, how do you keep a Tiger running? Precision engineering means customization, of parts and knowledge. If you want to fix a Tiger, you need Tiger specific parts. If you want to fix a Tiger, you need Tiger specific expertise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs3nkqekderq68cn0k20kynb))\n- The Sherman is the data science model built with little customization. Its developer continually monitoring the costs of complexity. Its parts are recognizable, interpretable and fixable for our colleagues. It is built efficiently and gets the job done with the appropriate level of accuracy.

The decoding component is a stack of decoders of the same number.

Each one is broken down into two sub-layers: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qrd7fxt1ac4aax6454rbd))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/Transformer_encoder.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43fbszx7j24ha1e5p8zg9d))\n- The encoder’s inputs first flow through a self-attention layer – a layer that helps the encoder look at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qw4a7944kyzwreqytcgxa))\n- The outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qz3249x4007d6d1x8xfw7))\n- The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence (similar what attention does in [seq2seq models](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3qzm559wjvn64wt6dy58h6))\n- As is the case in NLP applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector using an [embedding algorithm](https://medium.com/deeper-learning/glossary-of-deep-learning-word-embedding-f90c3cec34ca). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43bvwwr560weacv3m72s65))\n- The embedding only happens in the bottom-most encoder. The abstraction that is common to all the encoders is that they receive a list of vectors each of the size 512 – In the bottom encoder that would be the word embeddings, but in other encoders, it would be the output of the encoder that’s directly below ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43d82ec8nqmyx1ekqz4vsy))\n- After embedding the words in our input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder.

There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, however, and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while flowing through the feed-forward layer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43e1e3sr81vmzed7k31t8c))\n- an encoder receives a list of vectors as input. It processes this list by passing these vectors into a ‘self-attention’ layer, then into a feed-forward neural network, then sends out the output upwards to the next encoder.

I had personally never came across the concept until reading the Attention is All You Need paper. Let us distill how it works.\n  Say the following sentence is an input sentence we want to translate:\n  ”`The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired`”\n  What does “it” in this sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or to the animal? It’s a simple question to a human, but not as simple to an algorithm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43g439emrv0ppc47107xe6))\n- When the model is processing the word “it”, self-attention allows it to associate “it” with “animal”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gfpbp5215vsfmma0fs0e))\n- As the model processes each word (each position in the input sequence), self attention allows it to look at other positions in the input sequence for clues that can help lead to a better encoding for this word. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43gpw4bc4n7f112ta03hft))\n- If you’re familiar with RNNs, think of how maintaining a hidden state allows an RNN to incorporate its representation of previous words/vectors it has processed with the current one it’s processing. Self-attention is the method the Transformer uses to bake the “understanding” of other relevant words into the one we’re currently processing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43h3k8ahj564hz5njbse37))\n- The **first step** in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoder’s input vectors (in this case, the embedding of each word). So for each word, we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. These vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43j1j705y3zjy6nrp5ns5v))\n- Notice that these new vectors are smaller in dimension than the embedding vector. Their dimensionality is 64, while the embedding and encoder input/output vectors have dimensionality of 512. They don’t HAVE to be smaller, this is an architecture choice to make the computation of multiheaded attention (mostly) constant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43jkm0z72sfsdp5262dmsw))\n- What are the “query”, “key”, and “value” vectors? \n  They’re abstractions that are useful for calculating and thinking about attention. Once you proceed with reading how attention is calculated below, you’ll know pretty much all you need to know about the role each of these vectors plays.\n  The **second step** in calculating self-attention is to calculate a score. Say we’re calculating the self-attention for the first word in this example, “Thinking”. We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word. The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kds63qrdqsk5tw2dhknp))\n- The score is calculated by taking the dot product of the query vector with the key vector of the respective word we’re scoring. So if we’re processing the self-attention for the word in position #1, the first score would be the dot product of q1 and k1. The second score would be the dot product of q1 and k2. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ksg4fqem6rse31ga8gav))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self_attention_score.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43kvr3434ae2v73chyhv9e))\n- The **third and fourth steps** are to divide the scores by 8 (the square root of the dimension of the key vectors used in the paper – 64. This leads to having more stable gradients. There could be other possible values here, but this is the default), then pass the result through a softmax operation. Softmax normalizes the scores so they’re all positive and add up to 1. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43mggpdphmyfpht1a6s0cy))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention_softmax.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43rg7bw2v9aw5a2hr2f2f8))\n- his softmax score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position. Clearly the word at this position will have the highest softmax score, but sometimes it’s useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the current word. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43n1q3mav0cybysjmsbkt9))\n- The **fifth step** is to multiply each value vector by the softmax score (in preparation to sum them up). The intuition here is to keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on, and drown-out irrelevant words (by multiplying them by tiny numbers like 0.001, for example) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43natm8kn4nej6xgepqh08))\n- The **sixth step** is to sum up the weighted value vectors. This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this position (for the first word). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43r0r605atfm28k8d0qxwc))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-output.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43rjb5qjeebyfdqcaftnz2))\n- That concludes the self-attention calculation. The resulting vector is one we can send along to the feed-forward neural network. In the actual implementation, however, this calculation is done in matrix form for faster processing. So let’s look at that now that we’ve seen the intuition of the calculation on the word level. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43r88wb5xxryx9qmqenvgz))\n- Matrix Calculation of Self-Attention\n  **The first step** is to calculate the Query, Key, and Value matrices. We do that by packing our embeddings into a matrix X, and multiplying it by the weight matrices we’ve trained (WQ, WK, WV). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43s12mtkh4d0g4pvc8m0w5))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ry83pv2qkve5h59a8yw7))\n- **Finally**, since we’re dealing with matrices, we can condense steps two through six in one formula to calculate the outputs of the self-attention layer.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation-2.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43ssjaecxkvwnz37dejpyy))\n- The paper further refined the self-attention layer by adding a mechanism called “multi-headed” attention. This improves the performance of the attention layer in two ways:\n  1. It expands the model’s ability to focus on different positions. Yes, in the example above, z1 contains a little bit of every other encoding, but it could be dominated by the actual word itself. If we’re translating a sentence like “The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired”, it would be useful to know which word “it” refers to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43tgjwvw3dkd7fjx70q6by))\n- It gives the attention layer multiple “representation subspaces”. As we’ll see next, with multi-headed attention we have not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/Value weight matrices (the Transformer uses eight attention heads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder). Each of these sets is randomly initialized. Then, after training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a different representation subspace. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43tvg1gt8wkthajz0f75w2))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_qkv.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43v18wvm97ydchy62d2fg7))\n- f we do the same self-attention calculation we outlined above, just eight different times with different weight matrices, we end up with eight different Z matrices\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_z.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43v47h8vhrd36nkabghtxk))\n- This leaves us with a bit of a challenge. The feed-forward layer is not expecting eight matrices – it’s expecting a single matrix (a vector for each word). So we need a way to condense these eight down into a single matrix.\n  How do we do that? We concat the matrices then multiply them by an additional weights matrix WO.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_attention_heads_weight_matrix_o.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43vh72mghvq1ez0345p7tn))\n- That’s pretty much all there is to multi-headed self-attention. It’s quite a handful of matrices, I realize. Let me try to put them all in one visual so we can look at them in one place ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43vw9h0v6s4ys2pk44e428))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_multi-headed_self-attention-recap.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43wyr08hq72r7ntkn6jya2))\n- Now that we have touched upon attention heads, let’s revisit our example from before to see where the different attention heads are focusing as we encode the word “it” in our example sentence:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_2.png) \n  As we encode the word \"it\", one attention head is focusing most on \"the animal\", while another is focusing on \"tired\" -- in a sense, the model's representation of the word \"it\" bakes in some of the representation of both \"animal\" and \"tired\".\n  If we add all the attention heads to the picture, however, things can be harder to interpret:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization_3.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43yat77cam7ysnc577vh70))\n- One thing that’s missing from the model as we have described it so far is a way to account for the order of the words in the input sequence.\n  To address this, the transformer adds a vector to each input embedding. These vectors follow a specific pattern that the model learns, which helps it determine the position of each word, or the distance between different words in the sequence. The intuition here is that adding these values to the embeddings provides meaningful distances between the embedding vectors once they’re projected into Q/K/V vectors and during dot-product attention. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43yyj61gv31j0syr73xyga))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_vectors.png) \n  To give the model a sense of the order of the words, we add positional encoding vectors -- the values of which follow a specific pattern.\n  If we assumed the embedding has a dimensionality of 4, the actual positional encodings would look like this:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_example.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr43znch1bsfjnb2b928qek7))\n- One detail in the architecture of the encoder that we need to mention before moving on, is that each sub-layer (self-attention, ffnn) in each encoder has a residual connection around it, and is followed by a [layer-normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450) step.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr440f4v2m98ewn3esstkrv8))\n- If we’re to visualize the vectors and the layer-norm operation associated with self attention, it would look like this:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_2.png) \n  This goes for the sub-layers of the decoder as well. If we’re to think of a Transformer of 2 stacked encoders and decoders, it would look something like this:\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_3.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4413g6rgtjkqb5vw6brsbw))\n- Now that we’ve covered most of the concepts on the encoder side, we basically know how the components of decoders work as well. But let’s take a look at how they work together.\n  The encoder start by processing the input sequence. The output of the top encoder is then transformed into a set of attention vectors K and V. These are to be used by each decoder in its “encoder-decoder attention” layer which helps the decoder focus on appropriate places in the input sequence: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr441fp3bt80av1s3zq5df63))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_1.gif) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr441tgtwqrtp61jmjh4gr26))\n- The following steps repeat the process until a special symbol is reached indicating the transformer decoder has completed its output. The output of each step is fed to the bottom decoder in the next time step, and the decoders bubble up their decoding results just like the encoders did. And just like we did with the encoder inputs, we embed and add positional encoding to those decoder inputs to indicate the position of each word.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_decoding_2.gif) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4422r1a9ggxktc1bjvk6qf))\n- The self attention layers in the decoder operate in a slightly different way than the one in the encoder:\n  In the decoder, the self-attention layer is only allowed to attend to earlier positions in the output sequence. This is done by masking future positions (setting them to `-inf`) before the softmax step in the self-attention calculation.\n  The “Encoder-Decoder Attention” layer works just like multiheaded self-attention, except it creates its Queries matrix from the layer below it, and takes the Keys and Values matrix from the output of the encoder stack. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr442gq9g1s6t401zvnszsbg))\n- The decoder stack outputs a vector of floats. How do we turn that into a word? That’s the job of the final Linear layer which is followed by a Softmax Layer.\n  The Linear layer is a simple fully connected neural network that projects the vector produced by the stack of decoders, into a much, much larger vector called a logits vector.\n  Let’s assume that our model knows 10,000 unique English words (our model’s “output vocabulary”) that it’s learned from its training dataset. This would make the logits vector 10,000 cells wide – each cell corresponding to the score of a unique word. That is how we interpret the output of the model followed by the Linear layer.\n  The softmax layer then turns those scores into probabilities (all positive, all add up to 1.0). The cell with the highest probability is chosen, and the word associated with it is produced as the output for this time step. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr4436kday4y5drby2w9f7tc))\n- Now that we’ve covered the entire forward-pass process through a trained Transformer, it would be useful to glance at the intuition of training the model.\n  During training, an untrained model would go through the exact same forward pass. But since we are training it on a labeled training dataset, we can compare its output with the actual correct output.\n  To visualize this, let’s assume our output vocabulary only contains six words(“a”, “am”, “i”, “thanks”, “student”, and “\u003ceos\u003e” (short for ‘end of sentence’)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr443x9f8v1vp5wr32c61w5n))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/vocabulary.png) \n  The output vocabulary of our model is created in the preprocessing phase before we even begin training. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444rwtqjn4t79nrm00egbd))\n- Once we define our output vocabulary, we can use a vector of the same width to indicate each word in our vocabulary. This also known as one-hot encoding. So for example, we can indicate the word “am” using the following vector: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444akq9ps9fbk8fbx68zxy))\n- ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/one-hot-vocabulary-example.png) \n  Example: one-hot encoding of our output vocabulary ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr444ptpa7ancdtj89zmjjd6))\n- The Loss Function\n  Say we are training our model. Say it’s our first step in the training phase, and we’re training it on a simple example – translating “merci” into “thanks”.\n  What this means, is that we want the output to be a probability distribution indicating the word “thanks”. But since this model is not yet trained, that’s unlikely to happen just yet.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_logits_output_and_label.png) \n  Since the model's parameters (weights) are all initialized randomly, the (untrained) model produces a probability distribution with arbitrary values for each cell/word. We can compare it with the actual output, then tweak all the model's weights using backpropagation to make the output closer to the desired output. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr445m67n0aw8x514vrk2xb3))\n- But note that this is an oversimplified example. More realistically, we’ll use a sentence longer than one word. For example – input: “je suis étudiant” and expected output: “i am a student”. What this really means, is that we want our model to successively output probability distributions where:\n  • Each probability distribution is represented by a vector of width vocab_size (6 in our toy example, but more realistically a number like 30,000 or 50,000)\n  • The first probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “i”\n  • The second probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “am”\n  • And so on, until the fifth output distribution indicates ‘`\u003cend of sentence\u003e`’ symbol, which also has a cell associated with it from the 10,000 element vocabulary.\n  ![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/output_target_probability_distributions.png) \n  The targeted probability distributions we'll train our model against in the training example for one sample sentence.

They were first introduced in the now famous [Attention is All you Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper by Google researchers in 2017 (the paper has accumulated a whooping 38k citations in only 5 years) and associated [blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3n6ernt5z0vternwwjdav3))\n- The Transformer architecture is a specific instance of the [encoder-decoder models](https://machinelearningmastery.com/encoder-decoder-long-short-term-memory-networks/) that had become popular just over the 2–3 years prior. Up until that point however, attention was just one of the mechanisms used by these models, which were mostly based on LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) and other RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) variations. The key insight of the Transformers paper was that, as the title implies, attention could be used as the only mechanism to derive dependencies between input and output.

The encoder takes the input and encodes it into a fixed-length vector. The decoder takes that vector and decodes it into the output sequence. The encoder and decoder are jointly trained to minimize the conditional log-likelihood. Once trained the encoder/decoder can generate an output given an input sequence or can score a pair of input/output sequences. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3n8nw20y7ajxcesdrghgcx))\n- n the case of the original Transformer architecture, both encoder and decoder had 6 identical layers. In each of those 6 layers the Encoder has two sub layers: a multi-head attention layer, and a simple feed forward network. Each sublayer has a residual connection and a layer normalization. The output size of the Encoder is 512. The Decoder adds a third sublayer, which is another multi-head attention layer over the output of the Encoder. Besides, the other multi-head layer in the decoder is masked to prevent attention to subsequent positions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3n9m9h1r1hft2s4e6qjns5))\n- t is clear from the description above that the only “exotic” elements of the model architecture are the multi-headed attention, but, as described above, that is where the whole power of the model lies ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3nap0873cpqq76ag1wrpky))\n- An attention function is a mapping between a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3njgkdgd6y9frntw9jxhf1))\n- Under the hood, the model is composed of an encoder and a decoder.\n  The encoder processes each item in the input sequence, it compiles the information it captures into a vector (called the context). After processing the entire input sequence, the encoder sends the context over to the decoder, which begins producing the output sequence item by item. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3nm5vg4dnv831j7dqytxrw))\n- The context is a vector (an array of numbers, basically) in the case of machine translation. The encoder and decoder tend to both be recurrent neural networks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3nmy39nha0ggw7mnkf0pa5))\n- You can set the size of the context vector when you set up your model. It is basically the number of hidden units in the encoder RNN. These visualizations show a vector of size 4, but in real world applications the context vector would be of a size like 256, 512, or 1024. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3nnhctxxw7npj11y72x88w))\n- RNN takes two inputs at each time step: an input (in the case of the encoder, one word from the input sentence), and a hidden state. The word, however, needs to be represented by a vector. To transform a word into a vector, we turn to the class of methods called “[word embedding](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-word-embeddings/)” algorithms. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3nphycgsrkr71be5r59p9a))\n- The next RNN step takes the second input vector and hidden state #1 to create the output of that time step. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3pdrygrfvtjz0eh0ysd8q7))\n- each pulse for the encoder or decoder is that RNN processing its inputs and generating an output for that time step. Since the encoder and decoder are both RNNs, each time step one of the RNNs does some processing, it updates its hidden state based on its inputs and previous inputs it has seen ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3pgaqdtpdzq394war17qy2))\n- Notice how the last hidden state is actually the context we pass along to the decoder.

It made it challenging for the models to deal with long sentences. A solution was proposed in [Bahdanau et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) and [Luong et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025). These papers introduced and refined a technique called “Attention”, which highly improved the quality of machine translation systems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3pjqrvpfw11cff1zanafyg))\n- Attention allows the model to focus on the relevant parts of the input sequence as needed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3pmn7ntadgvqb3hwjnzf9g))\n- At time step 7, the attention mechanism enables the decoder to focus on the word \"étudiant\" (\"student\" in french) before it generates the English translation. This ability to amplify the signal from the relevant part of the input sequence makes attention models produce better results than models without attention. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr3pq25bkrqfpk9rb9pszx6p))\n- An attention model differs from a classic sequence-to-sequence model in two main ways:\n  First, the encoder passes a lot more data to the decoder.

Simply the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the location of the word ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqw7306pcef7dadk7jwa10v))\n- properties that a nice word embedding should have:\n  1. Words that are similar should correspond to points that are close by (or equivalently, to scores that are similar).\n  2. Words that are different should correspond to points that are far away (or equivalently, to scores that are significantly different). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqw7p89nvv67b5nsv09ttz7))\n- There is something more to these word embeddings, and it is that they don’t only capture word similarity, but they also capture other properties of the language. In language, words can be combined to get more complicated concepts. In mathematics, numbers can be added or subtracted to get other numbers. Could we build a word embedding that captures relations between words, as relations between numbers? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqw8b9k95jxtv87nhs89219))\n- ![](https://txt.cohere.ai/content/images/size/w2400/2023/01/Vis-2.1.jpg) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqwj9xnp6wam8m6fe3pewgr))\n- ![](https://txt.cohere.ai/content/images/size/w2400/2023/01/Vis-2.1.jpg) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqwj9ye9va8mc185vxyh44b))\n- The analogy “A puppy is to a dog like a calf is to a cow” can be translated into “The path from the word puppy to the word dog is the same as the path from the word calf to the word cow”. The analogy “A dog is to a cow like a puppy is to a calf” is also captured in this rectangle ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqwj85kpr6s0maystb7j6tg))\n- The main property of word embeddings that is in effect here is that the two axes (vertical and horizontal) represent different things. If you look carefully, moving towards the right turns the puppy into a dog, and the calf into a cow, which is an increase in *age*. Likewise, moving upwards turns a puppy into a calf and a dog into a cow, which is an increase in the *size* of the animal. It seems that this embedding is understanding that the words in it have two main properties, or features: age and size. Furthermore, it seems that the embedding is locating age in the horizontal axis and size in the vertical axis. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqwqne86n0epfjcz2srzky4))\n- good word embedding would be able to capture not only age and size, but also many more features of the words. Since each feature is one new axis, or coordinate, then a good embedding must have many more than two coordinates assigned to every word. The cohere embedding, for example, has 4096 coordinates associated with each word. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqwrbbk8mfpbqsxmtyhghtb))\n- . A sentence embedding is just like a word embedding, except it associates every sentence with a vector full of numbers, in a coherent way. By coherent, I mean that it satisfies similar properties as a word embedding. For instance, similar sentences are assigned to similar vectors, different sentences are assigned to different vectors, and most importantly, each of the coordinates of the vector identifies some (whether clear or obscure) property of the sentence.

The intent and desired outcome determine the time-box, and the time-box determines the solution design. This is how Basecamp does it too—they have different [appetite](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.5-chapter-06#ingredient-2-appetite) for various problems, and scope the solutions accordingly.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqqvq07vrkf3f5gbdgy0bcs0))\n- We’ll want to time-box this too. An overly generous timeline can lead to non-essential features being squeezed in and never-ending development—without actually deploying it, no one benefits from it.

But now—thanks to the success of ChatGPT—as well as all the work we’ve done in making Wolfram|Alpha understand natural language—there’s finally the opportunity to combine these to make something much stronger than either could ever achieve on their own.

It’s a fever swamp of urges, desires, and judgments. It’s fixated on the past and the future, to the detriment of the here and now. ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=68))\n- Our entire lives, he argued, are governed by a voice in our heads. This voice is engaged in a ceaseless stream of thinking—most of it negative, repetitive, and self-referential. It squawks away at us from the minute we open our eyes in the morning until the minute we fall asleep at night, if it allows us to sleep at all. Talk, talk, talk: the voice is constantly judging and labeling everything in its field of vision. Its targets aren’t just external; it often viciously taunts us, too. ([Location 979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=979))\n- The ego is never satisfied. No matter how much stuff we buy, no matter how many arguments we win or delicious meals we consume, the ego never feels complete. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=998))\n- The ego is constantly comparing itself to others. It has us measuring our self-worth against the looks, wealth, and social status of everyone else. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1000))\n- The ego thrives on drama. It keeps our old resentments and grievances alive through compulsive thought. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1002))\n- Perhaps the most powerful Tollean insight into the ego was that it is obsessed with the past and the future, at the expense of the present. We “live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation,” ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1003))\n- “When you have one foot in the future and the other in the past, you piss on the present.” ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1009))\n- in the deadline-dominated world of news, I was always hurtling headlong through the day, checking things off my to-do list, constantly picturing completion instead of calmly and carefully enjoying the process. The unspoken assumption behind most of my forward momentum was that whatever was coming next would definitely be better. Only when I reached that ineffable … whatever … would I be totally satisfied. ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1010))\n- “Make the present moment your friend rather than your enemy. Because many people live habitually as if the present moment were an obstacle that they need to overcome in order to get to the next moment. And imagine living your whole life like that, where always this moment is never quite right, not good enough because you need to get to the next one. That is continuous stress.” ([Location 1171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1171))\n- The route to true happiness, he argued, was to achieve a visceral understanding of impermanence, which would take you off the emotional roller coaster and allow you to see your dramas and desires through a wider lens. ([Location 1503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1503))\n- In a nutshell, mindfulness is the ability to recognize what is happening in your mind right now—anger, jealousy, sadness, the pain of a stubbed toe, whatever—without getting carried away by it. ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1719))\n- According to the Buddha, we have three habitual responses to everything we experience. We want it, reject it, or we zone out. Cookies: I want. Mosquitoes: I reject. The safety instructions the flight attendants read aloud on an airplane: I zone out. Mindfulness is a fourth option, a way to view the contents of our mind with nonjudgmental remove. I found this theory elegant, but utterly unfeasible. ([Location 1721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1721))\n- Our minds have this other capability—a bonus level, to put it in gamerspeak—that no one ever tells us about in school. (Not here in the West, at least.) We can do more than just think; we also have the power simply to be aware of things—without judgment, without the ego. This is not to denigrate thinking, just to say that thinking without awareness can be a harsh master. ([Location 1743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1743))\n- “People come to me a lot feeling like they ought to be loving themselves, and I actually counsel against it,” he said. His delivery was off-the-cuff and shtick-free. In stark contrast to Brach, he argued that we needed to actively get in touch with our ugly side. “Mindfulness gives us a way to examine our self-hatred without trying to make it go away, without trying to love it particularly.” Just being mindful of it, he said, could be “tremendously liberating.” ([Location 1851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1851))\n- Seeing a problem clearly does not prevent you from taking action, he explained. Acceptance is not passivity. Sometimes we are justifiably displeased. What mindfulness does is create some space in your head so you can, as the Buddhists say, “respond” rather than simply “react.” In the Buddhist view, you can’t control what comes up in your head; it all arises out of a mysterious void. We spend a lot of time judging ourselves harshly for feelings that we had no role in summoning. The only thing you can control is how you handle it. ([Location 1909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=1909))\n- He’s talking about a verse where the Buddha calls everything we experience—sights, sounds, smells, etc.—the “terrible bait of the world.” “It’s … an amazing statement,” he says. “Moment after moment, experiences are arising, and it’s as if each one has a hook … and we’re the fish. Do we bite? Or do we not bite, and just swim freely in the ocean?” ([Location 2173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=2173))\n- After an initial period of “how dare he” indignation over Jim Murphy telling me I was never going to be a big-time anchorman, I decided to approach the problem in a Buddhist style: to lean into it, to take his views seriously, no matter how inconvenient they may have been—to respond, rather than react. ([Location 2607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=2607))\n- This, as Joseph had pointed out on retreat, is the lie we tell ourselves our whole lives: as soon as we get the next meal, party, vacation, sexual encounter, as soon as we get married, get a promotion, get to the airport check-in, get through security and consume a bouquet of Auntie Anne’s Cinnamon Sugar Stix, we’ll feel really good. But as soon as we find ourselves in the airport gate area, having ingested 470 calories’ worth of sugar and fat before dinner, we ([Location 2726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=2726))\n- “It’s not me telling you,” she said. “It’s neuroscience that would say that our capacity to multitask is virtually nonexistent.

Scientists had even come up with a term for this condition: “continuous partial attention.” It was a syndrome with which I was intimately familiar, even after all my meditating. ([Location 2833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=2833))\n- Another tip: take short mindfulness breaks throughout the day.

When you lurch from one thing to the next, constantly scheming, or reacting to incoming fire, the mind gets exhausted. You get sloppy and make bad decisions. I could see how the counterintuitive act of stopping, even for a few seconds, could be a source of strength, not weakness. This was a practical complement to Joseph’s “is this useful?” mantra.

([Location 3262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=3262))\n- Another pitfall was detachment. I thought I was being mindful of my distress when I was left out of the big stories, but really I was just building a wall to keep out the things that made me angry or fearful. The final pitfall to which I’d succumbed was nihilism: an occasional sense of, “Whatever, man, everything’s impermanent.” ([Location 3266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=3266))\n- “Praise Allah, but also tie your camel to the post.” In other words, it’s good to take a transcendent view of the world, but don’t be a chump.

In my defense, the term was deceptively bland. “It’s nonattachment to the results. I think for an ambitious person who cares about their career—who wants to create things and be successful—it’s natural to be trying really hard.

I had come up through a system that venerated bootstrapping and a fierce refusal to fail. Doing this without attachment didn’t seem to fit the paradigm. ([Location 3351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=3351))\n- again. I said, “When we last spoke, you said it’s okay to be ambitious, but don’t be attached to the results. I cut you off, as I usually do—but what does that mean?” “It’s like, you write a book, you want it to be well received, you want it to be at the top of the bestsellers list, but you have limited control over what happens. You can hire a publicist, you can do every interview, you can be prepared, but you have very little control over the marketplace. So you put it out there without attachment, so it has its own life. Everything is like that.” ([Location 3354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=3354))\n- Striving is fine, as long as it’s tempered by the realization that, in an entropic universe, the final outcome is out of your control. If you don’t waste your energy on variables you cannot influence, you can focus much more effectively on those you can. When you are wisely ambitious, you do everything you can to succeed, but you are not attached to the outcome—so that if you fail, you will be maximally resilient, able to get up, dust yourself off, and get back in the fray. That, to use a loaded term, is enlightened self-interest.

([Location 3401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00KFHBNA4\u0026location=3401))\n- Meditation is the superpower that makes all the other precepts possible. The practice has countless benefits—from better health to increased focus to a deeper sense of calm—but the biggie is the ability to respond instead of react to your impulses and urges. We live our life propelled by desire and aversion. In meditation, instead of succumbing to these deeply rooted habits of mind, you are simply watching what comes up in your head nonjudgmentally.

The author presents thought-provoking ideas on how individuals can be empowered to monetize their data and provides a vision for a future where data is managed in a fair and equitable manner.\n\nThe book is aimed at the general population and focuses on the topic of digital data, which has become an integral part of our lives. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the consequences of our actions related to data, including its potential misuse and abuse, and the responsibility of each individual to take control of their data. \n\nJohn argues that the data industry has devalued personal data and relegated it to a meaningless commodity, leading to a situation where companies act as if they own the data created by individuals. Thompson predicts that this situation will change in the near future and highlights the importance of individuals having control over their data.\n\nThe author also argues that individuals should be paid for the data they create and that there should be legislation and regulation to address data privacy concerns and promote a fairer distribution of the value of data. Thompson proposes a framework for data stewardship that takes public interest into consideration and suggests a public data commons model as one of the solutions.\n\n\n\n\n## Highlights\n- Data for All is written to be an accessible book that is easy to read for the general population. (Location 14)\n- digital data is a ubiquitous element in our lives. (Location 51)\n- The best we can do is be armed with knowledge, understand the possible ramifications of our actions, the implications of the length of the life of the data we are creating each and every minute of every day, the potential for misuse and abuse of the information and data once it is beyond our grasp and control. (Location 91)\n- Each of us is responsible for our data and for the lifecycle of our data. Whether we have ever thought about it or not, it is up to us to take control of our data and to actively make conscious choices (Location 101)\n- today. The data ecosystem was never intended to become what it is today. That is because the data ecosystem has organically and rapidly evolved over the past 30 years in a globally distributed manner due to the independent actions of corporations, (Location 112)\n- These millions of entities are acting on their own best, narrowly defined, interests. No one is driving the bus, and that needs to change. (Location 114)\n- the company HAD met the legal burden, but in the end, it is DNA data. DNA data, at least a complete genome, is the ultimate personal identifier, isn’t it? It is impossible to truly deidentify your complete genome. (Location 134)\n- So when you sign up for a service and provide your swab with your DNA sample, the control of your resulting data is not with the DNA firm you signed up with. The policies they originally posted mean little to nothing and can be changed at any time sometimes without notice to you. In (Location 154)\n- “[The] first rule of data: once you hand it over, you lose control of it. You have no idea how the terms of service will change for your ‘recreational’ DNA sample,”[5] (Location 162)\n- The work of Arthur and his company sounds interesting and innovative for the early 1920s and it was, but the important item for us to consider is that over time, the ACNielsen company convinced the grocery store operators to provide, at no cost, or at very low cost, to his company all of the sales records of each and every one of their stores. (Location 181)\n- The next evolution of the industry included the first generation of data brokers like InfoUSA and other firms that worked predominantly in the direct mail industry. The second generation of data brokers included Experian, Acxiom, and Epsilon. These three firms are mostly known in the arena of credit scores and understanding credit worthiness of individuals. And today we have the third generation of data brokers that are focused on collecting information from on-line activities. Activities that include location data, browsing behavior, and purchasing. (Location 187)\n- The precedence set in this instance is that as data ownership has almost no value it can be transferred from individuals to companies without the consent of the individuals that created the data. This precedence of devaluing data and relegating data to a status of a meaningless commodity is at the core of the situation we find ourselves in today as it relates to data. (Location 194)\n- In 2006, Humby coined the phrase “Data is the new oil”. Michael Palmer expanded on Humby's quote by saying, like oil, data is “valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used. Oil has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc. to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so, data must be broken down and analyzed for it to have value.”[10] (Location 212)\n- In 1998, Google was founded. This was one of the first instances of consumers obtaining a free online service in exchange for unfettered use of the data that the users themselves created. The (Location 218)\n- Shortly after the creation and release of the Google service, the founders reacted in a spectacularly unimaginative manner by deciding that their business model would be advertising based. Technologically, Google is an interesting company, but from a business model perspective, they are about as dull as dishwater because venture capitalists and financial analysts prefer stability and predictability in business operations. (Location 230)\n- ACNielsen founded his firm 70 years ago by gaining free access to sales data to analyze how to sell more groceries to people through more targeted, and refined pricing, better store assortments, and improved shelf space optimization. That ultimately led to targeting of radio and television advertising/ Today we are offered virtually the same thing on our computers over the internet with very little to no change in the underlying premise. (Location 233)\n- To them, we remain THE commodity to be sold, through our data. (Location 237)\n- The rights of individuals to own, protect, manage, and monetize their data has been usurped by a past that has little to no relevance to the data ecosystem we have today. (Location 246)\n- Companies around the world have acted like they own our data. That is not true and is only a temporary situation that will change in the near future. (Location 247)\n- Haugen leaked one Facebook study that found that 13.5% of U.K. teen girls in one survey say their suicidal thoughts became more frequent after starting on Instagram. Another leaked study found 17% of teen girls say their eating disorders got worse after using Instagram.”[19]About 32% of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse, Facebook's researchers found, which was first reported by the Journal. (Location 274)\n- The early founders of the data and analytics industry like Arthur Nielsen, Danny Moore, Wayne Levy, moved slowly at first, seeking to make money by selling insights on how to sell more household consumable goods. In the 90’s, analytics professionals were very careful to work on analytics that would help understand buyer behavior, assiduously avoiding unethical use cases. (Location 284)\n- our individual data is not that valuable and that it is like sand, ubiquitous and requiring much processing to make it valuable to firms and ultimately to us in the form of targeted messaging and advertising. (Location 313)\n- “Data is the New Sun is a more relevant analogy... as the sun can power an infinite number of uses at zero marginal cost, never wears out (or depreciates) and never depletes! At its heart, digital transformation is about economics: transitioning from yesterday’s “economics of oil” mentality (expensive to find, expensive to extract, expensive to transport, environmentally hazardous, depletes, messy, dirty, and environmental costly) to embracing the modern “economics of the sun” (clean, never depletes, never depreciates and is readily available to fuel an infinite number of uses).”[23] (Location 326)\n- “The most valuable asset of Uber, the ride-hailing service... is the data of the people who use it. The prime asset of Google, the largest library, which owns no physical library, is the index that takes customers to their desired websites. Therefore, the new valuable asset is not gold, but it is data. Data has become the new gold!”[24] The professor’s logic and arguments are solid and based in reality, but I do think they are limited in past historical thinking and are too limiting to the prospects of data. (Location 334)\n- Data exchanges, like stock exchanges, are where people and companies will congregate, virtually, to offer, buy and sell data in an open market. (Location 349)\n- data as “the new plastic”, because “we create a lot, we struggle to know what to do with it and it tends to turn up in the wrong places. And, for all the talk about the democratization of data, business is not yet culturally geared up to handle this. There’s a lot to do.”[27] (Location 356)\n- The characteristics of the sun and data are closely aligned in a physical and metaphorical sense. (Location 371)\n- People should be allowed to take an active part in the management/control, use, and monetization of their data. Today, individuals can engage in this process but it is disjointed, complicated, time consuming, and most people do not see the value in engaging the current process to limit and control their data. (Location 381)\n- Forward thinking governments have started to discuss the creation and regulation of data exchanges and data commons.[31] Companies will follow with offerings and capabilities where it will be simple for every person to make choices about the use of their data. These companies will make money from enabling individuals in the process of proactively managing, controlling, sharing, monetizing their data. (Location 386)\n- An informed population can and will make better decisions that can affect social change with this book and these ideas. (Location 393)\n- In western democracies, the idea of some all-knowing Big Brother is a fiction, no matter what some politicians tell you. The real problem is commercial companies, specifically the younger, more intelligent companies, (Location 566)\n- If we take the location data and we add the browsing data, now we have where you went, the routes you took, the time you spent at each location, and we have the products you viewed, the content you read, the various options you considered. Did (Location 633)\n- “Companies target me with offers and stories that I am not interested in. Therefore, they can’t be doing much with my data given how bad they are at understanding me and my true interests.” What individuals are missing is that companies are not good at understanding the difference between tangential and core interests today, but they are getting better and will get much better in the future. (Location 653)\n- It is important that we are clear that collecting data of all types and analyzing with ever increasing accuracy and speed is the goal of nearly all companies and will remain so for the foreseeable future. We cannot be complacent about the current lack of abilities (Location 658)\n- The most impressive firms and data science teams know and understand that the goal in all data collection efforts is to collect enough multi-faceted data about any person, behavior, or situation to be able to analyze, model, predict, prescribe, simulate, and optimize that situation to the interests of the parties executing the collecting and modeling activities. (Location 717)\n- The point is that the “free” services are not free. You are paying for them with your data and your agreement to allow these firms to observe, examine, aggregate, analyze, target, and sell you as a commodity. (Location 812)\n- “This new digital economy is described in a variety of ways: as a cognitive capitalism, where a systematic process of privatization of information in different forms allows for maximization of profits (Bauwens et al., 2019; Fumagalli et al., 2019), as a data colonialism, in which data is used to subjugate and transform social relations (Couldry \u0026 Mejias, 2019), or as a form of surveillance capitalism, in which various technological apparatuses monitor humans and try to predict and control human behavior for the sake of profit (Zuboff, 2019). (Location 841)\n- Those who do not have the luxury of considering the implications of sharing their data; those who live in poverty or make just enough to get by; those that are rarely in a position to worry about what is being done with their data. (Location 1023)\n- The goal here is moving people on the margin toward being aware, interested, caring, and actively engaged in understanding and acting on topics related to their data. (Location 1082)\n- Since you own your data, you have the full rights and abilities to grant or revoke a limited use license for your data. (Location 1115)\n- You can, in the future, revoke their right to use your data. That is the first step that GDPR has taken in relation to data owned by EU citizens. (Location 1117)\n- What if you don’t like how airline companies are contributing to climate change? You set the price of the use of your data for any airline to access and use your data in their operations, marketing and analytics efforts at 100 times, or a 1,000 times, or a million times the price that you would charge to a company that is involved in organic and sustainable farming, (Location 1129)\n- Children are being given electronic devices to distract them at younger and younger ages. These children are creating data and that data is being used to create new interfaces, new games, new modes of engagement; all of which are highly addictive. (Location 1157)\n- We asked how much the game cost. They responded that it was free. We explained that it did not cost them money to play the game, but that the game was not free. They asked what we meant. We went on to explain that they gave their name, age, e-mail address, location, and player activity to the company in order to play the game. (Location 1169)\n- We taught our children to think about their choices critically and proactively. That is all a parent can do. We should all be doing this with every child that we are responsible and accountable for. (Location 1194)\n- Personally, managing and monetizing your data is not possible today, but it will be in the coming years. (Location 1214)\n- Most people in the world do not have a stream or streams of passive income. “Passive income includes regular earnings from a source other than an employer or contractor. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says passive income can come from two sources: rental property or a business in which one does not actively participate, such as being paid book royalties or stock dividends,”[25] or a data dividend. Think about how nice that will be. Money for doing the things that you were going to do anyway and a stream of money that keeps coming each new week, month, or year. (Location 1217)\n- Data monetization stems from the concept of ownership of data held by the individuals that have created and are creating the data. (Location 1224)\n- The laws that are being drafted now envision that each person will be able to access the entire universe of their data and be able to set usage conditions and rules, monetary terms for each data element, date ranges of where data can used and where it cannot be used, exclusion lists of companies that cannot use your data, inclusion lists of preferred companies that can use your data as you have designated on preferred terms. (Location 1227)\n- You should be getting paid for the data you create on a regular and on-going basis, not the management teams of some random companies. (Location 1235)\n- What they do care about is corporate performance and growth, typically denominated in monetary terms. Yes, they all talk about products and services and helping the world, but it really comes down to the performance metrics around revenue. (Location 1242)\n- The data you create is yours and the revenue stream from that data should be yours. (Location 1243)\n- data or information has the following unique characteristics: · Is nonrivalrous · Is nondepleting · Is regenerative and nearly unlimited · Has relatively low inventory costs and transportation/transmission costs · Is more difficult to control and own · Is ecofriendly · If you spill it, you can’t clean it up[28] Data is truly and radically different than other commodities that the world has known in the past and should be treated in new and substantially different ways. (Location 1277)\n- “Typically, in the UK people trust the government and don’t trust [the tech] industry, and in the US people trust industry and don’t trust the government,” he says. More should be done to assuage fears about how tech giants handle user data, he adds. “To an extent, it’s how people are brought up and therefore cultural. But for people in the UK to trust these large American companies then you need to have serious legislation and regulation.”[32] (Location 1302)\n- The economic, social, monetary, and societal value of data will be more evenly distributed across societies, groups, and individuals. Understand, know and become a part of this movement. Talk about it at social gatherings. Post on social media. Talk with your professional colleagues who are involved in the lifecycle of any and all data. Reach out to your elected government officials and tell them that legislation related to data and your rights needs to be a priority, because (Location 1311)\n- Social media does a significant amount of damage to the world by algorithmically targeting people in the developing world with messages of division. Those people would benefit the most from a data dividend. (Location 1316)\n- One of the goals of these programs is slow or stop change that enables individuals to access, manage, and monetize their data. These lobbying efforts and associated proposals are very well designed, funded, planned, and are being executed in an orchestrated manner that is designed counter to improving access to data. (Location 1466)\n- There is opposition to change in the world of data from entities that profit from today's data ecosystem. (Location 1480)\n- When I was an adolescent it seemed the majority of people trusted our system of government or democracy; the US government, the media, our schools, and most of the institutions that make up American society to do what is in the best interest of we as individuals, the country, and the world. This was one aspect of what was referred to as American Exceptionalism.[4] (Location 1540)\n- By the end of the 1970s, only about a quarter of Americans felt that they could trust the government at least most of the time.”[5] (Location 1546)\n- Figure (Location 1548)\n- Autocratic leaders tend to be interested in shielding the public from data, making government operations more opaque and generally trend toward secrecy rather than openness. (Location 1562)\n- Contrary to how we treat, talk about, and perceive CEOs, they are simply people that find themselves in positions of influence and power, often more based on opportunity over ability. (Location 1600)\n- Like many Americans, Veselka’s daily life is saturated with the products and services pushed by big technology companies, paid and free. (Location 1629)\n- One of the major problems in the technology market is that there are not enough compelling options for the population to choose from. (Location 1665)\n- Internet companies, by contrast, got an exemption in the now-notorious Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which says content created by users is not the responsibility of web platforms. (Location 1677)\n- I believe that our data has the same type of intrinsic value and that we should be paid each and every time a data element that we have created is used. Perhaps we are paid a millionth of a penny, or perhaps we set the rate for what we are paid by the type of organization that wants to use our data. We will delve into this topic more deeply later in the book, but I wanted to make the comparison to music royalties (Location 1779)\n- our data has value, we should be paid when our data is used in a manner that delivers revenue and profit to any commercial organization. (Location 1782)\n- The concept is being discussed today and one name that is used to refer to the idea in practice is a data dividend. How would you like to get a check each month or every year for the use of your data? (Location 1784)\n- I believe individuals should be empowered to and should be able to easily set the price of our data used in each industry, company, and application. (Location 1786)\n- “The public sphere needs an ‘ecosystem of trust’ which could set out objectives of re-usage of data for the common good while protecting individual rights... related to data, asserting that the systemic level of data assemblage must be re-conceptualized to reject the data-as-a-commodity view and take public interest into consideration. For data stewardship to achieve its goals, it is necessary to consider the inherent properties of data as commons... framework....[A] public data commons as the model that is best suited to secure European rights and values while increasing data sharing at the same time.”[27] (Location 1838)\n- The Data Governance Act is a single step toward creating data commons that will collect data with the express purpose of using that data for public good and the good of everyone involved and not in just some conceptual manner, but in a tangible monetary manner for each EU citizen. (Location 1857)\n- The Data Act will be a major new initiative to ensure fairness by providing better control for data sharing to citizens and businesses. [Through the Data] Act, users will have more control over the data they generate via their smart objects and EU businesses more possibilities to compete and innovate and easily transfer data between service providers. The Data Act will aim at clarifying for EU consumers and businesses who can use and access what data for which purposes. (Location 1861)\n- One portion of the Data Governance Act (DGA) that is noteworthy are the clauses which outline the creation of Data Intermediaries (DI) also known as data cooperatives or data unions.[30] These are the institutions, organizations and frameworks that will enable citizens, EU citizens in the beginning, to take control of their data to move, aggregate, share and monetize the data as they wish. (Location 1869)\n- The overall level of trust granted these organizations by the general public is at an all-time low. These organizations are actively perpetuating a system the source of significant and valuable raw material, the users. We do not tolerate companies that egregiously exploit natural resources for the gain of a few. We should not tolerate the same abuse of our data going forward. (Location 2024)\n- We skimmed the surface of legislative and regulatory efforts from the governments in Europe, Australia, and the United States relating to our data. (Location 2027)\n- Privacy relates to freedom of choice and control in the sphere of one’s personal information– choices regarding what information you wish to share and, perhaps more important, what you do not want shared with others. (Location 2255)\n- Some defend privacy as focusing on control over information about oneself (Parent, 1983), while others defend it as a broader concept required for human dignity (Bloustein, 1964), or crucial for intimacy (Gerstein, 1978; Inness, 1992). Other commentators defend privacy as necessary for the development of varied and meaningful interpersonal relationships (Location 2269)\n- Think about the activities where you seek privacy and the motivating factors for why you seek it. Now overlay those activities with your online activities. Where is the intersection of your desire for privacy and your online activities? Would you want more control to access, modify or delete data related to those activities? Would you want to charge companies more money to access your data related to those activities, or would you prefer to block all companies from accessing that data? (Location 2299)\n- appears that privacy exhibits many of the characteristics of sleep. (Location 2331)\n- Privacy and secrecy are often confused. (Location 2340)\n- Privacy is consensual where secrecy is not; that is, there is a “right to privacy” but no equivalent “right to secrecy.” Those stigmatized or disadvantaged social groups who have little or no access to privacy utilize secrecy to conceal their behavior.”[23] (Location 2342)\n- When people know they are deprived of the right of privacy they will feel anxious, nervous, and worried about concealing data and information that may disadvantage them or their loved ones, colleagues, or compatriots. (Location 2348)\n- Privacy enables people to withdraw information, and/or their physical self, from the public view. (Location 2363)\n- People talk about and profess that they want a high degree of privacy, but then they regularly act in ways that actively reduces or eliminates the degree of privacy that they actually have. It is a paradox, (Location 2387)\n- “Large, complex organizations use data-sharing platforms to facilitate collaboration on data-driven projects, both within and between organizations. (Location 2744)\n- “It was long unanimously held among economists that natural resources that were collectively used by their users would be over-exploited and destroyed in the long-term. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters, and forests. She showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.”[9] (Location 2830)\n- Her work created a new understanding of the actual delineation between common resources and private property. She and her colleagues clarified and codified how organically organized groups optimized the management of common resources for long term sustainability in opposition to the previously held theory that all common pool resources would be exploited, depleted, and most likely destroyed. (Location 2843)\n- From the work of Elinor Ostrom, and others, the advocates of Open Data and Open Software extended her research, findings and insights from forestry, irrigation, and policing systems to the new worlds of data and software. (Location 2849)\n- Knowledge is open if anyone is free to access, use, modify, and share it— subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness.”[14] (Location 2860)\n- Open Data evolved in conjunction and in parallel with the concept of Open-Source Software (Location 2874)\n- The OKF is a not-for-profit organization that works to communicate, train and bring about the use of open data on a global basis. The mission of the OKF is, “to create a more open world– a world where all non-personal information is open, free for everyone to use, build on and share; and creators and innovators are fairly recognized and rewarded.”[19] It is worthwhile to note that the OKF’s mission exempts personal information from their definition of open. (Location 2893)\n- Open Data is an economic imperative that can drive a level of value generation such that it can be a driving force in lifting sections of populations and younger generations out of poverty. Open Data needs to be ubiquitous across all governments and all relevant data, and it will be in the coming years. (Location 2948)\n- “Data exchanges are emerging as a key component of the data economy. By connecting data suppliers and consumers through a seamless experience, data exchanges have created a modern-day gold rush to help modern, digital organizations address their insatiable hunger for data. And, by eliminating the friction from finding, acquiring, and integrating data, these exchanges make it easy for any company to monetize its data assets and create new revenue streams.”[27] (Location 2971)\n- The Shanghai Data Exchange was established to address the major difficulties in data trading including identification of data ownership, pricing of data, reaching mutual trust between transaction parties, initiating transactions and overall supervision, said local authorities.[30] (Location 2982)\n- 3. Data Marketplace - A data marketplace is a public data exchange open to any company that wants to supply or consume data. Some marketplaces are global in scope, spanning every industry, function, and type of data.[31] (Location 2994)\n- “Data intermediation services would include... data pools established jointly by several legal or natural persons with the intention to license the use of such a pool to all interested parties in a manner that all participants contributing to the pool would receive a reward for their contribution to the pool.”[32] (Location 3008)\n- One company that is working toward creating data unions that can be managed in a unified and consistent manner is Pooldata.io.[34] (Location 3027)\n- Data lineage is the same as your genealogical lineage. When new data is created from existing data; or generated from raw, aggregated, or other natural source of data, the new data has a lineage— a connection to the source or original data. (Location 3258)\n- Tracking data lineage is not hard to do. It simply requires keeping records of how data was created and where that data has been used. The new data world will create a new market for existing and expanded data lineage products and services. (Location 3269)\n- I expect that the royalty payments for our part in derived data will be less than naturally occurring data, but we will be paid, nonetheless. (Location 3310)\n- Synthetic data is created from our view of the world. We do not use existing data in the creation of synthetic data, we simply generate the data that we believe we need. (Location 3313)\n- Much of the synthetic data created today is created by using algorithms. Originally, we would create the data by hand from copying and extending data that we knew was close to or approximates the raw data. (Location 3324)\n- When I am executing consulting work, I ask for the rights to the simulation data, and most people are happy to sign those rights over to my consulting firm. If I am employed at a full-time job and I oversee this type of work, I ensure that all the (Location 3348)\n- most data that is created soon will be created without any human intervention. The data will be created in machine-to-machine interfaces and the data will be created, stored, managed, used, and analyzed without any humans being in the loop. (Location 3377)\n- Earlier I remarked that I did not view the early stages of the analytics continuum as true analytics, I still hold this to be true, but I wanted to include these early stages for clarity as to where the analytics continuum begins. (Location 3399)\n- Prescriptive models prescribe the actions that business executives, managers and subject matter experts should take. (Location 3431)\n- Based on the data used in the prediction/prescription efforts, data science teams build simulation systems that enable business users to vary their assumptions and plans. The simulation system is run many times to see which of their plans, ideas and visions produce the best business outcomes. (Location 3437)\n- simulation environments enable business managers to gain confidence that they are seeing the projected performance of markets, companies, products, and customers in a safe environment. Business managers can try sets of plans and variables that they have seen before in real world markets. They can validate the models are producing accurate results and empower business users to create new and interesting scenarios delivering a competitive advantage. (Location 3444)\n- Digital Twins[5] are an area of simulation that is widely used and has provided significant benefits to organizations around the world. (Location 3450)\n- Optimization models and applications build on all the preceding levels of data and analytics sophistication that we have discussed. (Location 3453)\n- Optimization models and applications analyze the billions and trillions of simulations and recommend the best course of action that is aligned with the business outcomes and objectives stated as the best outcome by the business executives, managers and subject matter experts. (Location 3459)\n- Data scientists are innovators, creators of change, drivers of transformation. We do not want statisticians to be data scientists, and the reverse is true as well. There are roles for both and we need and want both, but let’s not confuse the two. (Location 3486)\n- Do not hire a data scientist to execute purely statistical work and do not hire a statistician to be a data scientist. (Location 3487)\n- As with most changes in the world, data won’t change in a big bang. Not all factors will change in an instant. The world at large; laws, regulations, enforcement, business operations, attitudes and compliance does not change in the blink of an eye. (Location 3561)\n- · The current trend in consumer sentiment against being tracked, targeted, and messaged to with irrelevant offers, messages, and divisive content will continue to be of concern to a significant portion of the population. (Location 3634)\n- DIs will have access to data from millions of people, the DIs will constantly analyze the data, to glean insights on sources of demand, price points, access frequency, industries, and companies. If the laws around the world follow the EU model, DIs will be prohibited from selling data. (Location 3827)\n- Since they can’t sell data, they will be committed to their goal of making your data accessible, usable, valuable, and easy to leverage by you and the companies that want to use our data in their commercial efforts. (Location 3830)\n- DIs will be able to tell you which groups and categories of data are in demand and the market price that is being paid for that data. (Location 3833)\n- Integrating your data into larger groups can be done within your data sets. Combining your purchase data category with your browsing data category, would be a common integration. Integrating your in-store grocery purchases with your online grocery purchases would provide a complete wallet share of your grocery spending. Integrating data can be done with data of other people who have similar and/or dissimilar habits, lifestyles or economic status and can be done in many ways using the following dimensions (Location 3849)\n- As we have been discussing, you will be managing your data through your relationship with a DI. You will have several objectives and goals that help you align the deployment and use of your data with your values. If you are concerned about global warming, you can make your data or any subset of your data available to firms that support improving the global climate on very advantageous terms, you might even be able to pay those firms for using your data. (Location 3872)\n- Data is very different from the traditional commodities that we are accustomed to, it doesn’t wear out, it gets more valuable as you accumulate it, it can be integrated in unlimited ways, it is easily transported around the world with almost no cost, and it has unique scarcity/abundance properties. For all these reasons, the view we need to take on monetizing data is different than if we were thinking about gold, oil, cash, or diamonds. (Location 3903)\n- Doug Laney[12] has written the definitive book on understanding the underlying economics of data. The book is called, Infonomics[13]. (Location 3906)\n- Your economic status will play a part in the value placed on your data in the open market. People who buy and spend more and in greater amounts will probably be paid more than those who buy and spend less in lesser amounts, but that is from a purely commercial perspective. (Location 3932)\n- Your health status will play a part in valuing your data. People who have rare diseases or highly unusual blood types or disorders may be able to demand a premium price for their diagnostic, prescription history, medical records and genetic material and sequencing. (Location 3934)\n- “What if Facebook was an equitable business partner that shared half of its profit with those of us who actually provide the data that makes its business model run? Using my math (which is, again, open to debate), the average Facebook user would earn $10.77 per quarter. But, what if you are a more active user than average? Twice as active? Five times as active? Out of curiosity, I broke the numbers down below. · Half as active: $5.38 · Twice as active: $21.53 · Five times as active: $53.83 (Location 3942)\n- I believe, and I could be way off in my estimate of the annual data dividend, but in my view, there could be people who make over $20,000 to $50,000 or more each year from licensing their personal data. (Location 3954)\n- Take note of the word licensing. You will not sell your data to companies; you will license it. You will retain ownership of the data and you will provide a limited use license to your data. (Location 3956)\n- First, don’t do business with companies that you know are hurting you, your families, your communities, your country, and the world. If you are involved with such a company, stop using their service, delete all your data, tell all your friends to stop using the platform. (Location 3991)\n- Second, sign up for every “do not mail” list that you can. It doesn’t take long, and it really works. Most of our discussions have been about online data and that is the most important category, but companies still mail a significant amount of material and the lists and data being held by those companies is significant, and those companies are the most aggressive resellers of your data. (Location 3993)\n- sign up for every “do not call” list that you can. The results are the same as above, but just on your mobile device. (Location 4001)\n- I wanted all of you to know that the world of data that we live in today did not come about by happenstance, it was designed and built on purpose. (Location 4012)\n- I am keen for everyone to know about the flawed data ownership model that has persisted since the beginning of the modern data industry. (Location 4022)\n- I felt and feel that it was and is important for you to know and understand how trust plays an important role in your relationship with your data and the organizations that want to use your data. As with all relationships, we need to have a baseline of trust. (Location 4031)\n- I feel that it is imperative for the people who will read this book to be aware of the massive, latent amount of economic value that will be created through the new world of data and that the economic value should be more evenly distributed, (Location 4037)\n---\nauthor: [[John Thompson]]\ntitle: \"Data for All\"\ntags: \n- books\n- literature-note\n---\n# Data for All\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/default-book-icon-8.18caceaece2b.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[John Thompson]]\n- Full Title: Data for All\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- Data for All is written to be an accessible book that is easy to read for the general population. (Location 14)\n- digital data is a ubiquitous element in our lives. (Location 51)\n- The best we can do is be armed with knowledge, understand the possible ramifications of our actions, the implications of the length of the life of the data we are creating each and every minute of every day, the potential for misuse and abuse of the information and data once it is beyond our grasp and control. (Location 91)\n- Each of us is responsible for our data and for the lifecycle of our data. Whether we have ever thought about it or not, it is up to us to take control of our data and to actively make conscious choices (Location 101)\n- today. The data ecosystem was never intended to become what it is today. That is because the data ecosystem has organically and rapidly evolved over the past 30 years in a globally distributed manner due to the independent actions of corporations, (Location 112)\n- These millions of entities are acting on their own best, narrowly defined, interests. No one is driving the bus, and that needs to change. (Location 114)\n- the company HAD met the legal burden, but in the end, it is DNA data. DNA data, at least a complete genome, is the ultimate personal identifier, isn’t it? It is impossible to truly deidentify your complete genome. (Location 134)\n- So when you sign up for a service and provide your swab with your DNA sample, the control of your resulting data is not with the DNA firm you signed up with. The policies they originally posted mean little to nothing and can be changed at any time sometimes without notice to you. In (Location 154)\n- “[The] first rule of data: once you hand it over, you lose control of it. You have no idea how the terms of service will change for your ‘recreational’ DNA sample,”[5] (Location 162)\n- The work of Arthur and his company sounds interesting and innovative for the early 1920s and it was, but the important item for us to consider is that over time, the ACNielsen company convinced the grocery store operators to provide, at no cost, or at very low cost, to his company all of the sales records of each and every one of their stores. (Location 181)\n- The next evolution of the industry included the first generation of data brokers like InfoUSA and other firms that worked predominantly in the direct mail industry. The second generation of data brokers included Experian, Acxiom, and Epsilon. These three firms are mostly known in the arena of credit scores and understanding credit worthiness of individuals. And today we have the third generation of data brokers that are focused on collecting information from on-line activities. Activities that include location data, browsing behavior, and purchasing. (Location 187)\n- The precedence set in this instance is that as data ownership has almost no value it can be transferred from individuals to companies without the consent of the individuals that created the data. This precedence of devaluing data and relegating data to a status of a meaningless commodity is at the core of the situation we find ourselves in today as it relates to data. (Location 194)\n- In 2006, Humby coined the phrase “Data is the new oil”. Michael Palmer expanded on Humby's quote by saying, like oil, data is “valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used. Oil has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc. to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so, data must be broken down and analyzed for it to have value.”[10] (Location 212)\n- In 1998, Google was founded. This was one of the first instances of consumers obtaining a free online service in exchange for unfettered use of the data that the users themselves created. The (Location 218)\n- Shortly after the creation and release of the Google service, the founders reacted in a spectacularly unimaginative manner by deciding that their business model would be advertising based. Technologically, Google is an interesting company, but from a business model perspective, they are about as dull as dishwater because venture capitalists and financial analysts prefer stability and predictability in business operations. (Location 230)\n- ACNielsen founded his firm 70 years ago by gaining free access to sales data to analyze how to sell more groceries to people through more targeted, and refined pricing, better store assortments, and improved shelf space optimization. That ultimately led to targeting of radio and television advertising/ Today we are offered virtually the same thing on our computers over the internet with very little to no change in the underlying premise. (Location 233)\n- To them, we remain THE commodity to be sold, through our data. (Location 237)\n- The rights of individuals to own, protect, manage, and monetize their data has been usurped by a past that has little to no relevance to the data ecosystem we have today. (Location 246)\n- Companies around the world have acted like they own our data. That is not true and is only a temporary situation that will change in the near future. (Location 247)\n- Haugen leaked one Facebook study that found that 13.5% of U.K. teen girls in one survey say their suicidal thoughts became more frequent after starting on Instagram. Another leaked study found 17% of teen girls say their eating disorders got worse after using Instagram.”[19]About 32% of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse, Facebook's researchers found, which was first reported by the Journal. (Location 274)\n- The early founders of the data and analytics industry like Arthur Nielsen, Danny Moore, Wayne Levy, moved slowly at first, seeking to make money by selling insights on how to sell more household consumable goods. In the 90’s, analytics professionals were very careful to work on analytics that would help understand buyer behavior, assiduously avoiding unethical use cases. (Location 284)\n- our individual data is not that valuable and that it is like sand, ubiquitous and requiring much processing to make it valuable to firms and ultimately to us in the form of targeted messaging and advertising. (Location 313)\n- “Data is the New Sun is a more relevant analogy... as the sun can power an infinite number of uses at zero marginal cost, never wears out (or depreciates) and never depletes! At its heart, digital transformation is about economics: transitioning from yesterday’s “economics of oil” mentality (expensive to find, expensive to extract, expensive to transport, environmentally hazardous, depletes, messy, dirty, and environmental costly) to embracing the modern “economics of the sun” (clean, never depletes, never depreciates and is readily available to fuel an infinite number of uses).”[23] (Location 326)\n- “The most valuable asset of Uber, the ride-hailing service... is the data of the people who use it. The prime asset of Google, the largest library, which owns no physical library, is the index that takes customers to their desired websites. Therefore, the new valuable asset is not gold, but it is data. Data has become the new gold!”[24] The professor’s logic and arguments are solid and based in reality, but I do think they are limited in past historical thinking and are too limiting to the prospects of data. (Location 334)\n- Data exchanges, like stock exchanges, are where people and companies will congregate, virtually, to offer, buy and sell data in an open market. (Location 349)\n- data as “the new plastic”, because “we create a lot, we struggle to know what to do with it and it tends to turn up in the wrong places. And, for all the talk about the democratization of data, business is not yet culturally geared up to handle this. There’s a lot to do.”[27] (Location 356)\n- The characteristics of the sun and data are closely aligned in a physical and metaphorical sense. (Location 371)\n- People should be allowed to take an active part in the management/control, use, and monetization of their data. Today, individuals can engage in this process but it is disjointed, complicated, time consuming, and most people do not see the value in engaging the current process to limit and control their data. (Location 381)\n- Forward thinking governments have started to discuss the creation and regulation of data exchanges and data commons.[31] Companies will follow with offerings and capabilities where it will be simple for every person to make choices about the use of their data. These companies will make money from enabling individuals in the process of proactively managing, controlling, sharing, monetizing their data. (Location 386)\n- An informed population can and will make better decisions that can affect social change with this book and these ideas. (Location 393)\n- In western democracies, the idea of some all-knowing Big Brother is a fiction, no matter what some politicians tell you. The real problem is commercial companies, specifically the younger, more intelligent companies, (Location 566)\n- If we take the location data and we add the browsing data, now we have where you went, the routes you took, the time you spent at each location, and we have the products you viewed, the content you read, the various options you considered. Did (Location 633)\n- “Companies target me with offers and stories that I am not interested in. Therefore, they can’t be doing much with my data given how bad they are at understanding me and my true interests.” What individuals are missing is that companies are not good at understanding the difference between tangential and core interests today, but they are getting better and will get much better in the future. (Location 653)\n- It is important that we are clear that collecting data of all types and analyzing with ever increasing accuracy and speed is the goal of nearly all companies and will remain so for the foreseeable future. We cannot be complacent about the current lack of abilities (Location 658)\n- The most impressive firms and data science teams know and understand that the goal in all data collection efforts is to collect enough multi-faceted data about any person, behavior, or situation to be able to analyze, model, predict, prescribe, simulate, and optimize that situation to the interests of the parties executing the collecting and modeling activities. (Location 717)\n- The point is that the “free” services are not free. You are paying for them with your data and your agreement to allow these firms to observe, examine, aggregate, analyze, target, and sell you as a commodity. (Location 812)\n- “This new digital economy is described in a variety of ways: as a cognitive capitalism, where a systematic process of privatization of information in different forms allows for maximization of profits (Bauwens et al., 2019; Fumagalli et al., 2019), as a data colonialism, in which data is used to subjugate and transform social relations (Couldry \u0026 Mejias, 2019), or as a form of surveillance capitalism, in which various technological apparatuses monitor humans and try to predict and control human behavior for the sake of profit (Zuboff, 2019). (Location 841)\n- Those who do not have the luxury of considering the implications of sharing their data; those who live in poverty or make just enough to get by; those that are rarely in a position to worry about what is being done with their data. (Location 1023)\n- The goal here is moving people on the margin toward being aware, interested, caring, and actively engaged in understanding and acting on topics related to their data. (Location 1082)\n- Since you own your data, you have the full rights and abilities to grant or revoke a limited use license for your data. (Location 1115)\n- You can, in the future, revoke their right to use your data. That is the first step that GDPR has taken in relation to data owned by EU citizens. (Location 1117)\n- What if you don’t like how airline companies are contributing to climate change? You set the price of the use of your data for any airline to access and use your data in their operations, marketing and analytics efforts at 100 times, or a 1,000 times, or a million times the price that you would charge to a company that is involved in organic and sustainable farming, (Location 1129)\n- Children are being given electronic devices to distract them at younger and younger ages. These children are creating data and that data is being used to create new interfaces, new games, new modes of engagement; all of which are highly addictive. (Location 1157)\n- We asked how much the game cost. They responded that it was free. We explained that it did not cost them money to play the game, but that the game was not free. They asked what we meant. We went on to explain that they gave their name, age, e-mail address, location, and player activity to the company in order to play the game. (Location 1169)\n- We taught our children to think about their choices critically and proactively. That is all a parent can do. We should all be doing this with every child that we are responsible and accountable for. (Location 1194)\n- Personally, managing and monetizing your data is not possible today, but it will be in the coming years. (Location 1214)\n- Most people in the world do not have a stream or streams of passive income. “Passive income includes regular earnings from a source other than an employer or contractor. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says passive income can come from two sources: rental property or a business in which one does not actively participate, such as being paid book royalties or stock dividends,”[25] or a data dividend. Think about how nice that will be. Money for doing the things that you were going to do anyway and a stream of money that keeps coming each new week, month, or year. (Location 1217)\n- Data monetization stems from the concept of ownership of data held by the individuals that have created and are creating the data. (Location 1224)\n- The laws that are being drafted now envision that each person will be able to access the entire universe of their data and be able to set usage conditions and rules, monetary terms for each data element, date ranges of where data can used and where it cannot be used, exclusion lists of companies that cannot use your data, inclusion lists of preferred companies that can use your data as you have designated on preferred terms. (Location 1227)\n- You should be getting paid for the data you create on a regular and on-going basis, not the management teams of some random companies. (Location 1235)\n- What they do care about is corporate performance and growth, typically denominated in monetary terms. Yes, they all talk about products and services and helping the world, but it really comes down to the performance metrics around revenue. (Location 1242)\n- The data you create is yours and the revenue stream from that data should be yours. (Location 1243)\n- data or information has the following unique characteristics: · Is nonrivalrous · Is nondepleting · Is regenerative and nearly unlimited · Has relatively low inventory costs and transportation/transmission costs · Is more difficult to control and own · Is ecofriendly · If you spill it, you can’t clean it up[28] Data is truly and radically different than other commodities that the world has known in the past and should be treated in new and substantially different ways. (Location 1277)\n- “Typically, in the UK people trust the government and don’t trust [the tech] industry, and in the US people trust industry and don’t trust the government,” he says. More should be done to assuage fears about how tech giants handle user data, he adds. “To an extent, it’s how people are brought up and therefore cultural. But for people in the UK to trust these large American companies then you need to have serious legislation and regulation.”[32] (Location 1302)\n- The economic, social, monetary, and societal value of data will be more evenly distributed across societies, groups, and individuals. Understand, know and become a part of this movement. Talk about it at social gatherings. Post on social media. Talk with your professional colleagues who are involved in the lifecycle of any and all data. Reach out to your elected government officials and tell them that legislation related to data and your rights needs to be a priority, because (Location 1311)\n- Social media does a significant amount of damage to the world by algorithmically targeting people in the developing world with messages of division. Those people would benefit the most from a data dividend. (Location 1316)\n- One of the goals of these programs is slow or stop change that enables individuals to access, manage, and monetize their data. These lobbying efforts and associated proposals are very well designed, funded, planned, and are being executed in an orchestrated manner that is designed counter to improving access to data. (Location 1466)\n- There is opposition to change in the world of data from entities that profit from today's data ecosystem. (Location 1480)\n- When I was an adolescent it seemed the majority of people trusted our system of government or democracy; the US government, the media, our schools, and most of the institutions that make up American society to do what is in the best interest of we as individuals, the country, and the world. This was one aspect of what was referred to as American Exceptionalism.[4] (Location 1540)\n- By the end of the 1970s, only about a quarter of Americans felt that they could trust the government at least most of the time.”[5] (Location 1546)\n- Figure (Location 1548)\n- Autocratic leaders tend to be interested in shielding the public from data, making government operations more opaque and generally trend toward secrecy rather than openness.

(Location 1600)\n- Like many Americans, Veselka’s daily life is saturated with the products and services pushed by big technology companies, paid and free. (Location 1629)\n- One of the major problems in the technology market is that there are not enough compelling options for the population to choose from. (Location 1665)\n- Internet companies, by contrast, got an exemption in the now-notorious Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which says content created by users is not the responsibility of web platforms. (Location 1677)\n- I believe that our data has the same type of intrinsic value and that we should be paid each and every time a data element that we have created is used. Perhaps we are paid a millionth of a penny, or perhaps we set the rate for what we are paid by the type of organization that wants to use our data. We will delve into this topic more deeply later in the book, but I wanted to make the comparison to music royalties (Location 1779)\n- our data has value, we should be paid when our data is used in a manner that delivers revenue and profit to any commercial organization. (Location 1782)\n- The concept is being discussed today and one name that is used to refer to the idea in practice is a data dividend. How would you like to get a check each month or every year for the use of your data? (Location 1784)\n- I believe individuals should be empowered to and should be able to easily set the price of our data used in each industry, company, and application. (Location 1786)\n- “The public sphere needs an ‘ecosystem of trust’ which could set out objectives of re-usage of data for the common good while protecting individual rights... related to data, asserting that the systemic level of data assemblage must be re-conceptualized to reject the data-as-a-commodity view and take public interest into consideration. For data stewardship to achieve its goals, it is necessary to consider the inherent properties of data as commons... framework....[A] public data commons as the model that is best suited to secure European rights and values while increasing data sharing at the same time.”[27] (Location 1838)\n- The Data Governance Act is a single step toward creating data commons that will collect data with the express purpose of using that data for public good and the good of everyone involved and not in just some conceptual manner, but in a tangible monetary manner for each EU citizen. (Location 1857)\n- The Data Act will be a major new initiative to ensure fairness by providing better control for data sharing to citizens and businesses. [Through the Data] Act, users will have more control over the data they generate via their smart objects and EU businesses more possibilities to compete and innovate and easily transfer data between service providers. The Data Act will aim at clarifying for EU consumers and businesses who can use and access what data for which purposes. (Location 1861)\n- One portion of the Data Governance Act (DGA) that is noteworthy are the clauses which outline the creation of Data Intermediaries (DI) also known as data cooperatives or data unions.[30] These are the institutions, organizations and frameworks that will enable citizens, EU citizens in the beginning, to take control of their data to move, aggregate, share and monetize the data as they wish. (Location 1869)\n- The overall level of trust granted these organizations by the general public is at an all-time low. These organizations are actively perpetuating a system the source of significant and valuable raw material, the users. We do not tolerate companies that egregiously exploit natural resources for the gain of a few. We should not tolerate the same abuse of our data going forward. (Location 2024)\n- Privacy relates to freedom of choice and control in the sphere of one’s personal information– choices regarding what information you wish to share and, perhaps more important, what you do not want shared with others. (Location 2255)\n- Some defend privacy as focusing on control over information about oneself (Parent, 1983), while others defend it as a broader concept required for human dignity (Bloustein, 1964), or crucial for intimacy (Gerstein, 1978; Inness, 1992). Other commentators defend privacy as necessary for the development of varied and meaningful interpersonal relationships (Location 2269)\n- Think about the activities where you seek privacy and the motivating factors for why you seek it. Now overlay those activities with your online activities. Where is the intersection of your desire for privacy and your online activities? Would you want more control to access, modify or delete data related to those activities? Would you want to charge companies more money to access your data related to those activities, or would you prefer to block all companies from accessing that data? (Location 2299)\n- appears that privacy exhibits many of the characteristics of sleep. (Location 2331)\n- Privacy and secrecy are often confused. (Location 2340)\n- Privacy is consensual where secrecy is not; that is, there is a “right to privacy” but no equivalent “right to secrecy.” Those stigmatized or disadvantaged social groups who have little or no access to privacy utilize secrecy to conceal their behavior.”[23] (Location 2342)\n- When people know they are deprived of the right of privacy they will feel anxious, nervous, and worried about concealing data and information that may disadvantage them or their loved ones, colleagues, or compatriots. (Location 2348)\n- Privacy enables people to withdraw information, and/or their physical self, from the public view. (Location 2363)\n- People talk about and profess that they want a high degree of privacy, but then they regularly act in ways that actively reduces or eliminates the degree of privacy that they actually have. It is a paradox, (Location 2387)\n- “Large, complex organizations use data-sharing platforms to facilitate collaboration on data-driven projects, both within and between organizations. (Location 2744)\n- “It was long unanimously held among economists that natural resources that were collectively used by their users would be over-exploited and destroyed in the long-term. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters, and forests. She showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.”[9] (Location 2830)\n- Her work created a new understanding of the actual delineation between common resources and private property. She and her colleagues clarified and codified how organically organized groups optimized the management of common resources for long term sustainability in opposition to the previously held theory that all common pool resources would be exploited, depleted, and most likely destroyed. (Location 2843)\n- From the work of Elinor Ostrom, and others, the advocates of Open Data and Open Software extended her research, findings and insights from forestry, irrigation, and policing systems to the new worlds of data and software. (Location 2849)\n- Knowledge is open if anyone is free to access, use, modify, and share it— subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness.”[14] (Location 2860)\n- Open Data evolved in conjunction and in parallel with the concept of Open-Source Software (Location 2874)\n- The OKF is a not-for-profit organization that works to communicate, train and bring about the use of open data on a global basis. The mission of the OKF is, “to create a more open world– a world where all non-personal information is open, free for everyone to use, build on and share; and creators and innovators are fairly recognized and rewarded.”[19] It is worthwhile to note that the OKF’s mission exempts personal information from their definition of open. (Location 2893)\n- Open Data is an economic imperative that can drive a level of value generation such that it can be a driving force in lifting sections of populations and younger generations out of poverty. Open Data needs to be ubiquitous across all governments and all relevant data, and it will be in the coming years.

By connecting data suppliers and consumers through a seamless experience, data exchanges have created a modern-day gold rush to help modern, digital organizations address their insatiable hunger for data.

The core of strategic work is discovering critical factors in a situation and designing a way to coordinate actions to deal with those factors.\n\nA good strategy identifies the greatest challenges and includes a set of coherent actions to overcome them.\n\nStrategy is usually used a synonym of ambition, success or innovation. \n\nLogical structure of strategy (the kernel):\n- Diagnosis: Identifies obstacles\n- Guiding policy: Approach to deal with obstacles\n- Coherent action: Coordinated policies, resource commitments, and actions to carry out the guiding policy.\n\nGood strategy is not goal setting, but problem solving.\n\nGood strategy involves applying strengths (resources) to obtain advantages in the most promising opportunities. \nNatural sources of strength:\n- Coherent strategy: creates strength through the coherence of is design, the coordination of policies and actions.\n- Subtle shifts of viewpoint. A reframing of competitive situation can create advantage and weaknesses.\n\n# Part I Good and bad strategy \n# 1. Good strategy is unexpected\n\nMost companies don't have good strategy so having one is a source of natural advantage. The don't expect you to have a coherent strategy that involves resources, coordinated actions, policies and resources to overcome an important obstacle.\n\n## Apple\nTwo months away from bankruptcy, Jobs rejoined Apple. He cut Apple to the core, from 15 Desktop models to 1, killed printers and peripherals, emulated Dells supply chain in Asia and brought operating system from Next.\n\nHis next strategy was to wait for the next big thing (window of opportunity). This is not a recipe for success\n\n## Desert storm\nLeft hook maneuver to attack Irak. It was military strategy 101, butgood strategy is unexpected.\n\n`` Coordinating and focusing resources is important instead of dedicating them to unconnected targets ``\n\n# 2. Discovering power\nViewing things from fresh perspective uncovers strengths advantages threats and weaknesses.\n\nDavid and Goliath story shows that apparent weaknesses and apparent strength can be overcome.\n\n## Walmart \n\nCase study that helps uncover hidden power in situations. Conventional wisdom said that \"A full line discount store nerds a population vase of at least 100k\".\n\nIn a strategy exercise you should consider the competition even when it is not at the core of the exercise.\n\nIn this case the tipping point is that the operating unit is not the store but a network of stores.\n\n## Cold war strategy \n\nUs advantage was technology but the strategy was to to engage in developments  that imposed exorbitant costs in USSR, by focusing in areas that were expensive to counter.\n\n\u003e Use your relative advantages to impose out of proportion costs on the opposition and complicate his problem of competing with you \n\nThis is the discovery of the Hidden power in the situation.\n\n# Bad strategy \nIt is not the absence of good strategy it is the result of dysfunctional leadership and specific misconceptions\n- Fluff: inflated words to create the illusion of high level thinking\n- Failure to face the challenge fails to recognise the challenge\n- Mistaking goals for strategy. Statements of desire instead of plans to face the obstacles \n- bad strategic objectives: when fail to address critical issues or impracticable \n\n\u003e bad strategy is long on goals and short on policy and action\n\n## Fluff \nBuzzwords combined with superficial and obvious statements.\n\n## Failure to face the problem \n\nA strategy must define a challenge problem or obstacle and state a response or approach to overcome it.\n\n## Mistaking goals for strategy \n\nFind the most promising opportunities for the business looking at who your buyers are, who you compete with and what opportunities exist. Then build a strategy that channels your energy to one or two of the most attractive opportunities.\n\nPerformance goals or rolling budgets are not strategies \n\n## bad strategic objectives \n\nA general manager or CEO decides the general strategic objectives and subgoals for each part of the organisation.\n\nA leader uses strategy to bridge the path between overall goals and actionable specific objectives.\n\nA long list of objectives is not a strategy. A good strategy focuses energy and resources on very few pivotal objectives.\n\nAnother form of bad strategic objectives is to pursue unattainable objectives no one knows how to tackle with current resources and skills.\n\n`When a leader characterizes the challenge as underperformance, it set the stage for bad strategy. Underperformance is a result. The true challenges are the reasons of underperformance.`\n\n# Why so much bad strategy?\nBad strategy is the result of:\n- Unwillingness to choose: avoidance of taking decisions facing opportunity costs. Strategy requires focus and setting aside some goals. Universal buy-in might indicate the absence of choice. In organisations the older the inertia the larger resistance to change. See Arrow decision theory and Condorcet's paradox\n- Template style strategy. Max Weber's charismatic Vs formal leaders. Peter Drucker did not agree on the need of charisma to be an effective leader. Charismatic, transformational leadership has led to Template style strategic planning which usually involves things like vision, mission, values. This frees people to think on the true challenges they are trying to csolve.\n- Positive thinking displaces critical thinking and good strategy\n\n# The kernel of good strategy \nElements\n- Diagnosis: Describes the challenge. Answers the question \"What is it going on here?\". So diagnosis is a judgement of facts, a simplified model that allows us to tackle complexity and advance in problem solving. This model focuses in factor that can be addressed with policy. **It is the why.\n- Guiding policy: Overall approach to face the challenge. Provides direction without explicitly defining what to do. Many people call strategy to guiding policy, but stating a diagnosis you can find alternative guiding policies. A good guiding policy tackles the challenge in the diagnosis by leveraging sources of advantage. It can be in itself an advantage, for instance by reducing the uncertainty of what to do, how to compete how to organise. It also helps focusing resources on specific set of challenge. **It is the what.\n- A set of coherent actions that carry out the guiding policy in a coordinated way. Strategy must decide priorities, and a great way to sharpen strategy is the necessity to act. We always hope that with a great design we can accomplish several conflicting objectives but the truth is that we need strategy to choose what to do and what to abandon. The coordination and coherence of action acts as a prominent source of advantage.  Coherence imposed by a system by design, not adhoc, the kind of unnatural coordination that would not exists if it weren't without strategy. Centralization has many caveats (coordination interrupts and de specialized people, among others) but some benefits only appear if decisions are properly coordinated.  **It is the how.\n\n\n## Part II Sources of power \n\n# Using leverage \nConcentrate force, focus, energy and minds in pivotal objectives.\n\n- Anticipation of market demand and competitors behaviour and reactions.\n- Pivotal objectives magnify the effects of focused energy and resources.\n- Concentration means that sometime focusing on a limited number of objectives you reach a threshold level (a critical level of effort necessary to affect the system). It is also wise to increase perceived effectiveness by concentrating on targets that catch attention.\n\n# Proximate objectives \nCreate feasible objectives with the skills and resources at hand. Sending man to the moon Vs the war on drugs.\n\n- Solving  ambiguity. Proximate objectives does wonders to organizational energy and focus. Challenges usually appear impossible because of complexity and uncertainty. A good leader can pass the organisation a simpler and solvable problem.\n- Taking a strong position and creating options. The more dynamic the situation the poorer your forecast. In uncertain scenarios make moves that improve your position and create opportunity. \n- Hierarchies of objectives. Your goal when you know how to crawl, must be to learn to walk. Once you learn to walk you can aim at running. \n\n# Chain-link systems \nChain link systems are those limited by its weakest link. Once there exists a weak link ain't no point in strengthening the rest of the system. \n\n- Getting stuck. Higher quality in a link that is not matched with higher quality in other links may cause worse results. \n- Getting unstuck. Quality matching in chain link systems requires working without inmediate returns. \n- Excellence. A well designed chain linked system is really difficult to replicate. For instance many IKEA policies are different from the norm (traditional furniture retailers does no carry large inventories, normal retailers don't do own designs or use catalogs instead of sales people) and work coherently in a chain like logic.\n![[IMG_20220705_232755.jpg]]\n\n# Using design \nWe can learn from military strategy the importance of design:\n- Premeditation. Prior guidance with design and planning in advance.\n- Anticipation. Of the thoughts and behaviours by others.\n- Design of coordinated action. Choreography of a designed plan. Strategists are designers working to solve a problem not decision makers that choose among different options that are presented to them. \n\nDesign must find sweet spots which must balance with coordination among activities to make the whole strategy effective. Each part of the system must be reconsidered to the needs of the rest of the system. This means that design has to optimise performance while keeping in mind tradeoffs between capabilities and tight integration. The greater the challenge the greater need of resources or the greater the need for coherent, integrated, design-type strategy. Resources and integration are partial substitutes of each other. Integration costs are related to the difficulty to create tight integrations, narrower focus, more fragile and less responsiveness to change..\n\nPotent resource position can eventually lead to produce profit without great effort.\n\n\u003e Easy life breed laxity: success leads to laxity that leads to decline \n\nCurrent profit is usually thought to be the result of current actions but it may be the harvest of planting seasons long past.\n\nThe challenger usually faces the incumbent by leveraging a tight design -type strategy. \n\n\u003e Most incumbent will loosen their tight integration and begin to rely more on accumulated resources and less on clever design. They will lose the discipline of tight integration, allowing independent fiefdoms to flourish and adding so many products and projects that integration becomes impossible. Faced with the natural slowing of growth over time, they will try to create the appearance of youthful vigor with bolt-on acquisitions. Then, when their resource base eventually becomes obsolete, they, too, will become prey to another generation of upstarts. It is the cycle of life.\n\n# Focus\nIn order to identify a company's strategy byou have to do your own analysis you cannot fully buy what HBR is telling. \n\nTo begin you usually start by examining the competitive environment.\n\nThen look at each policy of the company and notice those that are different from the norm in the industry. We then try to distinguish the target they are trying to accomplish.\n\n![[IMG_20220708_091247.jpg]]\n\nFocus is the coordination of policies that produces extra power by interacting and overlapping effects. It denotes the application of that extra power to the right target.\n\nReal world has an inner logic that is no secret but usually is under the radar. To spot the real strategy you must work hard analysing qualitative information.\nTruth is that not all companies have a strategy. Strategy requires focus and many large companies pursue multiple goals at once without taking the max out of them.\n\n# Growth \nGrowth by acquisition to ramp up KPIs without thoughtful strategy eventually leads to worse performance. Moreover when you buy a company, specially a public one you pay way too much. \n\nHealthy growth it is the outcome of growing demand for special capabilities. It is the outcome of better products and services. The correct innovation processes usually leads to higher market share and a superior rate of profit.\n\n# Using advantage \nAdvantage results from asymmetries from competition. No company or organisation can have advantages at everything. You must exploit where you have advantages and avoid situations you are weak.\n\nYou might be great at running 1500 meters, and you can do a good job running 10k, but probably you cannot wrestle a gorilla.\n\nPorter's competitive advantage is either lower costs than your competitors, or greater perceived value for your customers or a combination of the two. \n\nSustainable competitive advantage requires that competitors cannot duplicate it. Isolating mechanisms are patents, reputation, network effects, huge economies of scale...\n\nCompetitive advantage is interesting when it can be updated, engineered and improved.\n\nWealth increases when competitive advantage increases and for that you need:\n- Deepening advantages. This could be achieved by cutting costs via improving processes a la Taylor or by increasing value by improving products via product development. \n- Broadening the extent of advantages by applying them to new markets. Extending a competitive advantage requires building on your strengths. Extensions based on proprietary know how might even enhance knowledge. Extensions based on brand reputation are risky because they can damage the core. For instance, pirates of Caribbean extend Disney brand to adventure movies. \n- Creating higher demand for advantaged products or services. That higher demand might be because we add more users or because each buyer demands more. The process of engineering higher demand \n- Block easy replication by competitors. The value of your business can be increased by reducing the risk of imitative competition. Patents, copyrights and brand recognition are entry barriers. Also creating a moving target, a product that is constantly evolving (not saying improving, just moving) makes it more difficult to be imitated.\n\n\n# Using dynamics\n\nDramatical technical inventions and business model innovations create competitive advantages.\n\nAnother way is to exploit exogenous changes such as technology shifts, competition, politics and buyer perceptions. These changes might erode old advantages weakening existing leaders or enabling new ones.\n\nThe role of a leader is to ride waves of change and ensure the resources and innovation are channeled toward positions that will become advantages.\n\nThe importance is not in forecasting but in understanding past and present and to be able to take advantage of a wave of change. For instance, the basis of success lately is related to software written by small teams.\n\nIn order to really challenge the experts you need to deep dive into the details and understand the fundamentals. \n\nIn order to ride the waves of change you do not need to understand them completely right, just to do it better than your competitors.\n\nWays to understand industry transitions:\n- Rising fixed costs: Growing fixed costs forces the industry to consolidate. \n- Deregulation: Changes in the rules that govern a market cause heavy modifications in the competitive landscape. Deregulated players and former monopolists are myopic of their actual costs so they might chase for years unprofitable market segments once the subsidies are gone.\n- Predictable biases: People usually do not see that surges in demand peak and the decline to normal levels. \n- Incumbent response: incumbents resist change and transition.\n- Attractor states: Potential efficient equilibrium that might be reach by the market.\n\n# Inertia and entropy\n\nInertia is the inability to adapt to changing circumstances. Understanding the inertia of rival can create windows of opportunity to win a market.\n\n- Inertia of routine. Standard routines define how an organisation process information and deal with change. You can overcome obsolete routines by hiring managers with better methods, or redesigning processes.a\n- Cultural inertia. Simplification helps breaking organizational culture inertia. \n- Inertia by proxy. Inertia created by old streams of profit when customers are too slow to replace products despite relative price or quality differences. \n\n\nEntropy affects weekly managed organizations that tends to become less organised and focused.\n\nOrganizational renewal helps reducing risks associated to inertia and entropy.\n\n\n# The science of strategy\n\nA new strategy is a hypothesis and it's implementation, an experiment.\n\nFunctional knowledge is created by experimenting with different strategies.\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T22:54:09.686473094Z","tags":null},"/notes/literature-notes/Books/How-to-Fail-at-Almost-Everything-and-Still-Win-Big":{"title":"How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big","content":"\n```\nIn order to succeed manage your energy by eating and doing exercise, hack your brains by daydreaming and embrace failure. \n```\n\n***\n**Author**: [[ ]]  [Scott Adams]\n**Source**: [[ ]]  \n**Tags**:  #books \n***\n\n# Introduction\n\nSuccess might be a combination of talent, hard work and luck. One might think that having a conscious strategy will do, but the truth is that we cannot disentangle the outcome and understand if it was this strategy or pure luck\n\nCalling bullshit requires a system. It is based on consistency, for instance in at least two dimensions of the following:\n- Personal experience\n- Experience of people you know\n- Experts\n- Scientific studies\n- Common sense\n- Pattern recognition\n\n# The tine I was crazy\nHe could talk to his cat,being a song or read a poem but he could not talk to other humans. This lead to doctors, psychiatry and loneliness.\n\nHe had to speak at an event in front of 1000 people and he was wondering if he would be able to do it \n\n# The day of the talk\n`when you stand in front of an audience your sensation of time is distorted. That's why inexperienced presenters speak too rapidly.`\n\nHe puts himself in that situation because he embraces failure as a path to learn \n\n# Passion is bullshit\nPassionate people show high energy and are persuasive about their passion but they are also less risk averse.\n\nPassion is a signal that you are good at something or that it is easy for you. Success causes passion more than passion causes success. \n\n# Goals versus systems\n\nCareer advice by a CEO: Every time you land a new job you should start looking for a better one. Job seeking as an ongoing process as better deals has their own schedule. Instead of setting a goal such as his boss' job, his system was to continually look for better options.\n\nGoals makes you feel miserable once you achieve them. Systems makes you feel energetic as they succeed every time you apply the system.\n\nWe can think of goals as situations in which once you succeed you are done, while systems are those that you do periodically with an expectation that they will get you to a better place.\n\nA system beats passion everytime. \n\n# My system\n\nBuild something easy to reproduce in unlimited quantities. This general strategy was narrow down with a focus on creativity. \n\n# Deciding versus wanting\n\n\u003e if you want success, figure out the price then pay it \n\nPrices: sacrifice personal life for grades, putting off having kids, taking business risks...\n\nSystems make the price lower so it may worth a go.\n\n# The selfishness illusion\n\nIn terms of generosity, three kinds of people:\n- Selfish\n- Stupid\n- Burden on others\n\nAdvocates for selfishness understood as a long run view of the right choices for you and others. For instance invest time on fitness, eating right, pursuing your career and spending quality time with your family and friends.\n\n# The energy metric\n\nIn order to make choices among different alternatives we can choose those that maximize ones energy. That leads to eating, dreamin, resting and also by having something in life that excites you. \n\nEnergy is something that gives you a positive lift, mentally or physically. It might be blogging, writing a book, exercising or building your own thing.\n\nA positive externality of good energy is that it gives a boost to the people around you.\n\nYou should manage energy as budgets in a company, seeking to maximize lo#ng term growth.\n\n## Matching mental state to activity\nYou should match your mood and energy levels to the activity, for instance creative tasks at the beginning of the day or exercise at noon. \n\n## Simplifiers va optimizers\nSimplifiers look for the easy Pareto solution although knowing that extra effor would lead to better outcomes.\n\nOptimizers aim for the best solution although it may increase the odds of failure.\n\n``Simplification is usually the right answer when you need communication with others. Optimizing might be worth when you so things on your own or with a closed partner ``\n\nHumans are bad at good at following simple systems and these are also less subject to unexpected failures.\n\nSimple systems are probably the best way to achieve success. Once you have success, optimizing begins to have more value. \n\n\u003e  Simplification frees up energy and time.\n\n\n\n## Tidyness\nIf your work space is a mess it distracts you and steals your energy. Tidy up for an energy boost.\n\n## Knowledge and the lack thereof\nA big energy killer Is the fear that you do not know how to do something your job would require.\n\nTo avoid this:\n- Ask questions and you usually find simple solution or cheap professionals that do it \n- Flash research in Google to check out are the stuff that worries you so much\n\n## Don't be an asshole\n\nBeing an asshole causes energy drains all around and it might involve spending energy cleaning up the mess you made.\n\n## Priorities\n\n1. You. Health\n2. Economics\n3. Family, friends, lovers\n4. Local community, country, world\n\nKeep your priorities straight by judging how options affect your personal energy\n\n# Managing your attitude\n\nYou can manipulate your thoughts to manage your attitude.\nButtons: Exercise, food, sleep.

Once you become good at unimportant things such as hobbies or sports, you are more prepared to be successful in more important challenges.\n\nYou should manipulate your perceptions to whatever makes you happy, because you are probably wrong about the nature of reality anyway.\n\n\n# My speaking career\n\nAsked for a price for giving a speech that he did not want to give he asked for 5k. \n\nThe speaking requests flowed in as he entered the speaking circuit after overpricing himself.\n\n# Recognizing your talents and knowing when to quit\n\nYou can achieve something extraordinary by combining ordinary talents (vs gifted extraordinary innate world class talent)\n\nYou can recognise your talents by:\n- Checking what you did obsessively as a kid\n- Tolerance for risk. We accept high risk when we expect high returns.\n\nA system to achieve success involves trying lots of different things (sampling). This contradicts the general wisdom of sticking to it.\n\nHow you can tell when to quit? Things that work out started out well. \n\n\u003e small successes can grow into big ones, but failures rarely grow into successes\n\nSuccesses have X factor, meaning that you should focus if a segment of the audience is enthusiastic about it, instead of focusing in average responses. X factor can be detected by what users do with your product, instead of what they are saying.\n\n# Is practicing your thing?\n\nSome people enter in flow mode when they are practicing (endless repetition) while for others this is hell on earth. The latter usually prefer gaining experience on a variety of functions or knowledge.\n\n# Managing your odds for success\n\nSuccess formil: Every skill you acquire doubles your odds of success.\n\nGood + Good \u003e Excellent\n\nThe power of leveraging multiple mediocre skills and also because everytime you learn a new skill it makes learning new skills easier.\n\n\n`The more you know the more you can know.`\n\nReading newspapers to broaden you exposure to new topics which rewires your brains and provides with energy boosts. \n\n\n# The math of success\n\nYou can't control luck.

The audience only gets to listen, I get to speak, to feel, to be fully alive. I will absorb their energy and turn into something good. \n\nThe transformative power of praise versus the corrosive impact of criticism.\n\n### Psychology\nIt is important to understand how the brain perceives the world. \n\nSalespeople know that you can manipulate buyers by controlling what they compare.\n\n\u003e Quality is not an independent force of the universe, it depends on what you choose as your frame of reference.\n\nIt includes a large list of cognitive biases and mental models.\n\nIn order to succeed do more of what works and less of what doesn't.\n\nPeople do not usually use reason for their big decisions in life. Do not think of people as rational beings. \n\nHe suggests that we need to embrace psychology and try to be lifelong learners.\n\n### Business writing\nGet a course. Get rid of unnecessary words and passive voice.\n\n### Accounting\nCash flow projections, spreadsheet, time value of money.\n\n### Design\nYou can learn rules and tricks of design to be effective in designing PowerPoints, flyers or whatsoever.\n\n### Conversation\n\nReasons to have a conversation:\n- Exchange information\n- Plan\n- Complain\n- Entertain\n- Feel connected\n- Befriend\n- Seduce\n- Persuade\n- Be polite\n- Avoid awkward silence\n- Brag\n\nHow to make a conversation with strangers:\n\n- Ask questions till you find a mutual interest:\n\t- What's your name?\n\t- Where do you live?\n\t- Do you have a family?\n\t- What do you do for a living?\n\t- Do you have any hobbies/sports?\n\t- Do you have any travel plans?\n- Don't complain\n- Don't talk about boring experiences\n- Don't dominate the conversation\n- Don't get stuck on a topic. Keep moving\n- Planning is useful but it is not a conversation\n- Keep the sas stories short\n\nThe six questions might make you feel awkward but people love talking about themselves and it is very easy for everyone. You work as a conversationalist is to keep asking questions till you find what you have in common with the stranger. The point is to make the other person feel good.\n\n#### How to become a master of short but interesting stories?\nOr how to translate interesting experience into story form. Good storytelling needs preparation, and that means following a structure:\n- Setup: keep it brief, one sentence or two.\n- Pattern: establish a pattern your story will violate\n- Foreshadowing: you leave clues where the story is going\n- The characters: fill the story with personality traits\n- Relatability: pick story topics your listeners will relate to \n- The waist: no plot twist, no story. \n- Topics to avoid\n\t- Food\n\t- TV plots\n\t- Dreams\n\t- Medical stories\n\n### Overcoming shyness\nOne technique involves imagining you are acting instead of interacting. A shy person can act like someone else more easily than acting like himself. Fake it till you make it.\n\nAnother technique is acting interested in other people. \n\nAlso try to classify people in two classes: thing people (love talking about tech, politics, tools and possessions, processes and systems) and people people (love talking about people doing interesting things), they get easily bored about thing topics.\n\nLearn from outgoing people by observing them.\n\n### Second language\nLearn a second language.\n\n### Golf\nNot for business but for bonding with other males. It is also vacation for the mind.\n\n### Proper grammar\n\nYou don't want to sound like a moron/hillbilly.\n\n### Persuasion\nYou always have to try to convince people.\n\nReally enjoyed the take on this (p 135)\nUseful expressions:\n- Because\n- Would you mind...?\n- I'm not interested\n- I don't do that\n- I have a rule\nI just wanted to clarify\nIs there anything you can do for me?\nThank you\nThis is just between you and me\n\nWhen situations are uncertain and complicated they look for leadership and decisiveness sometimes looks like leadership. So if you deliver decisiveness some people will picture you as a leader.\n\nYou can also persuade others by sharing your enthusiasm.\n\n### Technology\nYou should have basic understanding of tech for working at startups, conversations and self preservation\n\n### Proper voice technique\nYou need breath control (from the belly button, not chest), tone (deep low tones) and mouth strategies. Posture is also important. \n\n# Pattern recognition\n\n### Successful people patterns\n\nThe seven habits of highly effective people by Stephen Covey:\n1. Be proactive\n2. Begin with the end in mind\n3. Put first things first\n4. Think win-win\n5. Seek first to understand then be understood\n6. Synergize \n7. Sharpen the saw\n\nAnd Adams add:\n- Lack of fear of embarrassment: Bravery\n- Education\n- Exercise: physical exercise brings energy, creativity, bravery...\n\n# Humor\nHumor makes you look more attractive and confident. It also helps you out life in perspective.\n\nIn-person humor requires effort but it does not demand too high quality.\n\nAvoid humor traps:\n- Overcomplaining\n- Don't overdo the selfdeprecaition\n- Don't mock people\n- Avoid puns and wordplay\n\n# Affirmations\nAffirmations consist of repeating what you want to achieve while you imagine it.\n\nI, Pelay Arbues, will become a...\n\nIt is not magical thinking, it is about increasing focus. \n\n# Timing is luck too\nTiming is the greatest form of luck. You have to synchronise with the universe. You can increase the odds by working hard, but it still works that way.\n\n# Experts\nThey are right 98% of the time on the easy stuff and 50% on complicated, rare or misterious stuff \n\n# Association programming\n\nKnew a guy that thought that he could became rich if he was surrounded by rich people. It might make sense because you learn by example, your energy might be boosted by seeing your goal live and direct.\n\nPeople surrounded by overweight people is more prone to gain weight.\n\n# Happiness\nGoal in life: maximize lifetime experience of happiness.\n\nScience of happiness: happiness isn't as dependent of your circumstances as you may think. \n\nYou can get 80% of happiness by manipulating your body chemistry. Tips:\n- Being able to do what you want, *when* you want. The timing can be more important than the things. A mediocre meal when you are starving \u003e delicious meal when you are not hungry. A flexible schedule might make you really happy, so work towards flexible schedule.\n- Happiness is more related to the direction of the vector than the position of the point. You feel happy when things move in the right direction and bad when they has a downward trend. Sports provide you a feeling of progress.\n- Imagining a brighter future also brings joy. Recall the daydreaming chapter.\n\nBad mood is usually the result of good food, sleeping, exercise, imagination , flexible schedule and routine.\n\n# Diet\nDiet that works: eat as much as you want, of anything you want, whenever you want.\n\nYour food preferences change thoroughout your life and you can deliberately change your preferences. Cravings can be manipulated. You can erase and gro cravings for unhealthy and healthy food. \n\n## Food is mood\nIn order to change perception of healthy food you need you need to look at things differently. \n\nThink of yourself as a programmable robot. Eating right makes you less vulnerable to the bumps of life. \n\n## look for the pattern\n\nTest the *food is mood* claim by testing it and observing your mood depending on your recent meals. Which meals make you feel energetic Vs sleepy? \n\n## The food-exercise connection\n\nFood is the fuel that makes exercise possible because it can turn your lazy mood to energetic.\n\n### Breaking the simple carb addiction\n\nIn order to reduce the willpower necessary to avoid simple carbs (white rice, bread, potatoes). The system is to break addiction to simple carbs and you can do it by eating as much as you want from other meals.\n\n### how to know what to eat\nNutrition science is full of bullshit and very incomplete. \n\n### know why you are eating\nWhen you don't get enough sleep you have a bold hunger sensation. This can be calmed with nuts and chease. \n\n### how to make healthy food taste good\nAvoid healthy but boring and awful food. Eating that requires too much willpower and it is unsustainable. \nExperiment with veggies and:\n- Butter\n- Salt\n- Cheese\n- Soy sauce\n\nProteins:\n- Edamame\n- Nuts\n- Pasta\n- Cheese\n- Veggies\n\n## Coffee\nCoffee makes you enjoy your daily routine. 2-4 cups a day can make you more eager to exercise.\n\n\n\n![[IMG_20220601_002744.jpg]]\n\n# Fitness\n\n## Be active everyday\n\nIf you are active everyday, all other physical exercise will require much less willpower. And no willpower requirements is essential for the system to work.\n\nThe system is being active everyday, and all forms of exercise will do: take a walk, play basketball, clean garage...\n\nPractical ways to schedule exercise:\n- Join an organised team\n- Always exercise at the same time everyday\n- Exercise with your partner\n\n## Motivation to exercise\nYou need a good diet for having the energy to work out. And you don't want to overexercise so much you don't want to be active the next day. Also soreness is a penalty for exercise.\n\nBe active everyday and avoid setting specific days for exercise. Rest days break the habit.\n\n## Rewards\nHealthy snack, read articles on the phone or a cup of coffee.\n\nCoffee can help you to get in the mood of exercise.\n\nPut on exercise clothes an sneakers and allow yourself to not exercise.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T22:54:09.686473094Z","tags":null},"/notes/literature-notes/Books/How-to-take-smart-notes":{"title":"How to take smart notes","content":"\n```\nIt presents a note taking workflow aimed to support effective writing\n```\n\n***\n**Author**: [Sönke Ahrens]  \n**Source**: [How to take smart notes]  \n**Tags**:  #productivity #writing #learning\n***\n\n\n# Everything you need to know\n\nNote taking is not just about collecting and aggregating thoughts but about making connections and sparkling new ideas.\n\nA well conceived working progress requires that used tools and techniques fit together.\n\n## The slip box\nIt is composed by:\n- Bibliographic notes: Sketchy notes on the reading\n- Permanent notes: A note describing just an idea and linking to other notes (bibliographic or permanent)\n- Index of entry point notes: Topics arise from entry point notes linking to other notes.\n\n\n# How to write a paper\n\nIn order to write a paper you need:\n1. Assemble notes putting arguments and put them into order\n2. Write a draft\n3. Review it and correct it\n\nThe main work here is not taking notes but thinking, reading and coming up with new ideas.\n\n## Step by step\n\n1. Fleeting notes. Sketch ideas, reminders of what is in your head. Put them in the inbox and process them later. If idea is already mature, go directly to write a permanent note in the slip box.\n2. Literature notes. When reading, watching videos or podcast write down what catches your attention and might be reusable. **Write it with your own words**. Keep the notes in the reference system.\n3. Permanent notes. Go to the slip-box and process notes taken in step 1 and 2. Write a new idea that comes into your mind. **One idea, one note ** write in a clear concise way but it must be self contained disclosing references and sources. Discard fleeting notes and move literature notes to reference system.\n4. Add permanent notes to slip box. Add links to related notes, link the notes in a MoC or index.\n5. Develop your topics by exploring the slip box, search for clusters of ideas, contradictions and find arguments that need further research and exploration.\n6. At this point there should be enough ideas to decide the topic to write about. Look through connections and collect relevant notes. Look for missing and redundant information. Go back to reading and develop new ideas.\n7. Write a rough draft. Translate the notes into a coherent text. Detect holes in the argument, fill them or change the argument.\n8. Edit and submit the paper.\n\nIn the process you will find many accidental ideas that you were not expecting to find when you started. Don't waste this ideas because they do not fit the topic you are currently working on. Instead save them, process them and generate new ideas.\n\n# The 4 underlying principles\n\n## Writing is the only thing that matters\n\n``` Working as if nothing else counts than writing```\n\nTaking notes involves more focused reading, as you cannot write everything down and you always rephrase the contents in your own words (pushing you to understand the core ideas).\n\nBy doing everything with the purpose of writing means that you do it deliberately. \n\n## Simplicity is paramount\nThe slip box is not arranged by topics, but it is simoky linked so that instead of forcing you to remember where you store them you focus on finding forgotten ideas and creating new ones \n\nIn order to work we need a critical mass of notes and distinguish between 3 kind of notes:\n- Fleeting notes: remainders of information, it can be thrown away once processed. Capture ideas while you are doing something else \n- Permanent notes: self-explanatory and fully understandable without more context. They are not reminders of thoughts or ideas, but the actual thought. \n- Project notes: relevant only for one project, might be archived once the project is done.\n\n\n\n\nA typical mistake in note taking workflow is considering all notes as permanent. Good ideas are diluted among irrelevant information. \n\nOther problem is to only take project related notes. You can't restrict your thinking to a narrow project, instead new information and ideas on other topics will emerge while researching. It is tempting to try to open new projects to dump these new ideas, but in that case you end up with a lot of unfinished projects.\n\nIn the case of treating all notes as fleeting ones, what follows is chaos and the need to clean up and start all over again.\n\n## Nobody ever starts from scratch\nUsually scientific workflows follow this structure:\n- Choose a topic\n- plan research\n- do research\n- write\n\nTruth is that writing is not that linear.\n\nIn order to do the first step, choose a topic, you should have already read and thought about a bunch of topics.\n\nMost how to guides rely heavily on brainstorming, because it is the only thing left when you have not been taken proper notes.\n\nFinding a topic it is just follow the threads in the slip box, while it is a frustrating experience when you have not been writing while studying.\n\n## Let the work carry you be forward\n\nWhen you are working in flow mode, the own work generates momentum to keep on working. For that to happen, the workflow must be rewarding so that the dynamics of work and reward yield a feedback loop that motivates you to keep on working.\n\n[[Growth mindset]]: seek and welcome feedback. Means finding pleasure out of changing for the better instead of receiving praise. Being praised for what you are, instead of what you do might lead you to have a fixed mindset.\n\nTaking notes is a form of increasing the frequency of feedback. Instead of waiting for a paper review we obtain feedback on our notes as writing them test our understanding and our hability to explain them concisely. Reviewing our notes to take permanent notes, means realizing that we do not fully understand an idea and hence we can work on it. This leads to better writing, faster note taking and deeper reading. \n\n# The six steps to successful writing\n\n## 1. Separate and interlocking tasks\n\nAttention deficit caused by multitasking and information overload lowers productivity. You can not get better at multitasking as no one is able to focus on more than one thing at a time. Instead what we do is to switch focus really fast what in the end drains our attention.\n\nHere we are talking about sustained attention, no Mt about focus attention or flow ( a state of highly focused and effortless attention)\n\nAn organised workflow might improve our sustained attention by separating tasks and pushing us to focus on one thing for longer.\n\nWriting also involves very different tasks such as proof reading, acting as a external reviewer and writing itself. Other tasks are developing thoughts, outlining. The same happens with reading, some texts need our full attention while others might be skimmed.\n\nSuccessful problem solving, as it is done by eminent scholars, involves deep focus spans of time and flexible playful moments.\n\nBesides attention, we must also take into account the importance of writing on order to free up our short term memory. It has been demonstrated that we can only hold 7+-2 things at a time in our head, that's why it is so important to dump our thoughts to a system that takes removes the need to keep in mind what we were thinking or doing.\n\nZeigarnik effect: open tasks are a burden for our short term memory till they are done. Done or written down. We can trick our brains so that they no longer worry about that task. \n\nBesides attention, and short term memory there is a third scarce recourse: motivation or willpower. Ego depletion refers to a drain of willpower caused by prior use of volition. \n\nStandardised working environment reduces cognitive load (see [[pelayoarbues/02.Reference-System/_Notes/Team Cognitive Load]]) which reduces willpower to a lesser extent .\n\n## 2. Read for understanding\n\nReading with pen and paper is the way to translate other people's ideas into our own coherent thought. This is quite different than copying and pastin, since even using the same expression as the author they will be less meaningful than our own words.\n\nAfter finishing the book, go through the notes and see if you can relate them with any note at the slip box.\n\nConfirmation bias is one of the major flaws of human reasoning. Slip box allows us to gather facts and ideas that connect with other thoughts independently if they are addition or contradictions. The only thing that matters is that if it's relevant or irrelevant.\n\nRe-reading, cramming and re-reviewring are not effective for learning, just for passing the test. A much more successful learning method is elaboration (thinking about the meaning of what we read, how it can inform different topics and and linking to other topics). \n\n## 3. Take Smart notes\n\nEffective reading means being able to read a text linkinh it to other topics and find missing arguments. A common problem of inexperienced readers is that the stick to the frame where the tamezt lives.\n\nWriting can be thought as an external arena where the true process of thinking occurs. It allows us to see our thoughts in perspective which is exactly what we need to keep them as rational as possible and far from the reach of brains shortcuts. \n\nWe can measure memory capabilities in terms of:\n- Storage strength: ability to store memories\n- retrieval strength: ability to build connections between memories\n\n\n## 4.Develop ideas\n\nThe slip box is where our thinking occurs. It is then impossible to keep it constrained inside artificial boundaries. That is why there are no categories for the permanent notes, but connections with other thoughts.\n\nIn order to develop topics we might use an index that links to notes via tags, but what it is more important is the links between notes so that we enter into the realm of surprise and concrete thoughts.\n\nAnother way is to create a note that overviews a topic.\n\nIn order to choose a keyword we should think as writers instead of archivists, and look for in which circumstances we want to come across with this thought. Keywords should be chosen while keeping an eye on the topics we are interested to develop, not in isolation. \n\nTypes of cross references:\n- links in notes reviewing a topic. \n- note-to-note links\n\nThe process of linking notes is a core point of thinking. And leaning on the slip box, as an external source of ideas, we are less prone to imagine connections where there aren't any.\n\nWorking with the slip box is sometimes disillusioning as weay think that one idea we are excited about is ours and novel and when we check the slip box might be already there (we have forgot about it) and it may not be ours. This is not only bad news as we may usually confront ideas or find subtle but interesting differences between them, sparking new discussion.\n\n\n\u003e Build a lattice of mental models to get a grip on reality. Charlie Munger\n\n\nCreativity and generation of new ideas depends more on breaking old habits of thinking.\n\nStructure and restrictions, although it sounds counterintuitive, are a source of scientific progress and creativity.\n\n## Share your insight\n\nThe slip box allows us to easily find a topic to write about. This is because our own motivations are already there: in each note we take, in every literature note we write, we are saving those thoughts that are more important to us. ==It is evolution applied to ideas and thoughts.==\n\nTruly understanding something means that we can spot it's limitations. That is the reason why are more open to new ideas the more familiar we are with certain thoughts. You may just fall in love with a particular idea that you are somewhat familiar with. But once you go deeper, find new perspectives on the topic and think on its drawbacks you might be able to find something that becomes a breakthrough innovation.\n\nWork on different manuscripts at the same time. That prevents you from blockages and also takes advantage of by-products generated by each project which might generate new projects which generate more by-products and so on.\n\nZeigarnik effect. Our brains are occupied with a task till it is accomplished or written down. Every long work fills the time we set aside for it while short tasks are often speed up. It is important to get started and do it with feasible tasks (take a note is much better than working on vague and I'll defined task such as keep working an overdue paper)\n\nOne of the hardest parts of reviewing a draft is to get rid (cut) some parts. For this purpose it is a good practice to cut the sentences and paragraphs that don't fit in the manuscript to other document in order to reuse them. Although you may never use them, it helps you psychologically to \"kill your darlings\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T22:54:09.686473094Z","tags":null},"/notes/literature-notes/Books/Leonardo-Da-Vinci":{"title":"Leonardo Da Vinci","content":"# Leonardo Da Vinci\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gFt86kFAL._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Walter Isaacson ]]\n- Full Title: Leonardo Da Vinci\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- Leonardo was following a practice that had become popular in Renaissance Italy of keeping a commonplace and sketch book, known as a zibaldone ([Location 1755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071Y385Q1\u0026location=1755))\n- Francesco di Giorgio from Siena.8 Thirteen years older than Leonardo, he was another exemplar of an artisan who combined art, engineering, and architecture. He had begun as a painter, moved as a young man to Urbino to work as an architect, returned to Siena to run the underground aqueduct system, and was a sculptor in his spare time. He was also interested in military weaponry and fortifications. In other words, he was the Leonardo of Siena. ([Location 2325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071Y385Q1\u0026location=2325))\n- Ideas are often generated in physical gathering places where people with diverse interests encounter one another serendipitously. That is why Steve Jobs liked his buildings to have a central atrium and why the young Benjamin Franklin founded a club where the most interesting people of Philadelphia would gather every Friday. At the court of Ludovico Sforza, Leonardo found friends who could spark new ideas by rubbing together their diverse passions. ([Location 2517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071Y385Q1\u0026location=2517))\n- “Before you make a general rule of this case, test it two or three times and observe whether the tests produce the same effects.”7 ([Location 2718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071Y385Q1\u0026location=2718))\n- The empirical method used by Bacon emphasized a cycle: observations should lead to a hypothesis, which should then be tested by precise experiments, which would then be used to refine the original hypothesis. Bacon also recorded and reported his experiments in precise detail so that others could independently replicate and verify them. ([Location 2751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071Y385Q1\u0026location=2751))\n- In his notebook, he described his method—almost like a trick—for closely observing a scene or object: look carefully and separately at each detail. He compared it to looking at the page of a book, which is meaningless when taken in as a whole and instead needs to be looked at word by word. Deep observation must be done in steps: “If you wish to have a sound knowledge of the forms of objects, begin with the details of them, and do not go on to the second step until you have the first well fixed in memory.”23 ([Location 2813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071Y385Q1\u0026location=2813))\n- There is a paradox, which goes back to Zeno in the fifth century BC, involving the apparent contradiction of an object being in motion yet also being at a precise place at a given instant. Leonardo wrestled with the concept of depicting an arrested instant that contains both the past and the future of that moment. He compared an arrested instant of motion to the concept of a single geometrical point. The point has no length or width. Yet if it moves, it creates a line. “The point has no dimensions; the line is the transit of a point.” Using his method of theorizing by analogy, he wrote, “The instant does not have time; and time is made from the movement of the instant.” ([Location 2826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071Y385Q1\u0026location=2826))\n- Guided by this analogy, Leonardo in his art sought to freeze-frame an event while also showing it in motion. “In rivers, the water that you touch is the last of what has passed, and the first of that which comes,” he observed. “So with time present.” He came back to this theme repeatedly in his notebooks. “Observe the light,” he instructed. “Blink your eye and look at it again. That which you see was not there at first, and that which was there is no more.”27 ([Location 2832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071Y385Q1\u0026location=2832))\n- Known as a paragone, from the Italian word for “comparison,” such a discourse was a way for artists and scholars to attract patrons and elevate their social status during the Italian Renaissance. This was another field in which Leonardo, with his love of both stagecraft and intellectual discussion, could excel as an ornament of the court. ([Location 3968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071Y385Q1\u0026location=3968))\n- I think not. Look longer at the picture. It vibrates with Leonardo’s understanding that no moment is discrete, self-contained, frozen, delineated, just as no boundary in nature is sharply delineated. As with the river that Leonardo described, each moment is part of what just passed and what is about to come. ([Location 4284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071Y385Q1\u0026location=4284))\n- Each moment incorporates what came right before and what is coming right after.

You try to establish what is making you unhappy and then find a solution. In the process, you can easily dredge up past regrets and conjure up future worries. This further lowers your mood. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=247))\n- The mind is constantly trawling through memories to find those that echo our current emotional state. For example, if you feel threatened, the mind instantly digs up memories of when you felt endangered in the past, so that you can spot similarities and find a way of escaping. It happens in an instant, before you’re even aware of it. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=254))\n- The same is true with unhappiness, anxiety and stress. It is normal to feel a little unhappy from time to time, but sometimes a few sad thoughts can end up triggering a cascade of unhappy memories, negative emotions and harsh judgments. Before long, hours or even days can be coloured by negative self-critical thoughts such as, What’s wrong with me? My life is a mess. What will happen when they discover how useless I really am? Such self-attacking thoughts are incredibly powerful, and once they gather momentum they are almost impossible to stop. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=258))\n    - Tags: [[favorite]] \n- Similarly, our mood can act as an internal context that is every bit as powerful as a visit to an old holiday destination or the sound of a favourite tune. A flicker of sadness, frustration or anxiety can bring back unsettling memories, whether you want them or not. Soon you can be lost in gloomy thoughts and negative emotions. And often you don’t know where they came from – they just appeared, seemingly from thin air. You can become bad tempered, irritable or sad without really knowing why. You’re left wondering, Why am I in a bad mood? Or, Why do I feel so sad and tired today? ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=273))\n- The spirit in which you do something is often as important as the act itself. Think about the significance of this for a moment. If you do something in a negative or critical way, if you over-think or worry or carry out a task through gritted teeth, then you will activate your mind’s aversion system. This will narrow the focus of your life. You will become like a mouse with an owl complex: more anxious, less flexible, less creative. If, however, you do exactly the same thing in an open-hearted, welcoming manner, you thereby activate the mind’s ‘approach’ system: ([Location 1647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=1647))\n- And nothing activates the mind’s avoidance system (and depresses the approach system) quite like the feeling of being trapped. This sense of being trapped is also central to extreme feelings of exhaustion and helplessness. Many people who work too hard, or for too long, end up being trapped by their own perfectionism and sense of responsibility – they feel, deep down, that there is ‘no escape’. It might be that, some time in the past, they had to prove something to themselves or to others because they felt bullied into it at home or at school, but over the years this has turned into a script that keeps them locked into old habits. This bullying script may once have helped them get what they wanted in life, but now it simply exhausts them. In this way, it’s all too easy to cede all the power to the ‘self-attacking’ aspect of yourself, and over time, you can come to feel, deep down, that the only possible response is to submit to the pressure. Trapped, your world seems to present fewer and fewer alternatives for action, whatever the reality. The result is long-term ‘demobilisation’. Your playfulness becomes paved over with concrete. ([Location 1653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=1653))\n- Although these negative spirals are incredibly powerful, you can begin to dissipate them just by becoming aware of them. The simple act of turning towards and observing them, helps to dissolve such patterns because they are maintained by the mind’s Doing mode (which has volunteered to help, even though it’s precisely the wrong tool for the job). The Doing mode entangles you even more in your own ideas of freedom, adding a sense of deep aversion and the demand that things should be different from how they are. So you become caught in a fantasy of freedom and miss the actuality of freedom available to you.

He was not sure he could control the class again today. It was not part of a janitor’s duty.1 ([Location 1938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=1938))\n- The way we interpret the world makes a huge difference to how we react. This is sometimes called the ABC model of emotions. The ‘A’ represents the situation itself – what a video camera would record. The ‘B’ is the interpretation given to the scene; the running story we create out of the situation, which often flows just beneath the surface of awareness but is taken as fact. The ‘C’ is our reactions: our emotions, body sensations and our impulses to act in various ways. Often, we see the ‘A’ and ‘C’ quite clearly, but we are not aware of the ‘B’. We think that the situation itself aroused our feelings and emotions when, in fact, it was our interpretation of the scene that did this. It’s as if the world were a silent film on which we write our own commentary. But the commentary, with its explanations of what is going on, happens so fast that we take it to be part of the film. It can become progressively more difficult to separate the ‘real’ facts of a situation from its interpretation. ([Location 1954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004TTHD9O\u0026location=1954))\n- Take self-criticism as an example: when we are feeling stressed or vulnerable, we only hear the inner critic and not the quieter voice of compassion. If we do hear an alternative to the unsettling thoughts, we probably won’t believe the answers because the emotional punch behind the thoughts is so powerful that it overwhelms all of our logic. If we dismiss our thoughts as ‘nonsense’ or tell ourselves to ‘get a grip’ or to ‘pull yourself together’ then this further lowers our morale, leaving us wide open to further feelings of weakness and inadequacy. To make matters even worse, every time the tape of self-criticism begins to roll, we immediately start embellishing the story. We begin trawling our minds for supporting evidence and ignore everything to the contrary. Is it any wonder then, that the rumour mill in our minds can cause us so much unnecessary suffering? Is it so surprising that all of the ways in which we try and quench those rumours only end up making things far, far worse? Instead of confronting the mind’s rumour mill with logic and ‘positive thinking’, it makes far more sense to step outside the endless cycle and just watch the thoughts unfold in all their fevered beauty. But this can be difficult. If you look closely at the ‘rumours’ that start washing around the mind when you feel stressed, you’ll see how much a part of you they really appear to be.

If we keep breathing in and out this way for a few minutes, we become quite refreshed.

The buzzer that goes off when you forget to fasten the seat belt in your car is a bell of mindfulness. Even non-sounds, such as the rays of sunlight coming through the window, are bells of mindfulness that can remind us to return to ourselves, breathe, smile, and live fully in the present moment.

I always went to the front yard and took my time eating it, sometimes half an hour or forty-five minutes for one cookie. I would take a small bite and look up at the sky. Then I would touch the dog with my feet and take another small bite. I just enjoyed being there, with the sky, the earth, the bamboo thickets, the cat, the dog, the flowers. I was able to do that because I did not have much to worry about. I did not think of the future, I did not regret the past. I was entirely in the present moment, with my cookie, the dog, the bamboo thickets, the cat, and everything.

They saw not only their tangerine, but also its mother, the tangerine tree. With some guidance, they began to visualize the blossoms in the sunshine and in the rain. Then they saw petals falling down and the tiny green fruit appear. The sunshine and the rain continued, and the tiny tangerine grew. Now someone has picked it, and the tangerine is here. After seeing this, each child was invited to peel the tangerine slowly, noticing the mist and the fragrance of the tangerine, and then bring it up to his or her mouth and have a mindful bite, in full awareness of the texture and taste of the fruit and the juice coming out. We ate slowly like that. Each time you look at a tangerine, you can see deeply into it. You can see everything in the universe in one tangerine. When you peel it and smell it, it’s wonderful. You can take your time eating a tangerine and be very happy.

Practicing mindfulness enables us to become a real person. When we are a real person, we see real people around us, and life is present in all its richness. The practice of eating bread, a tangerine, or a cookie is the same.

We turn off the TV, put down our newspaper, and work together for five or ten minutes, setting the table and finishing whatever needs to be done. During these few minutes, we can be very happy. When the food is on the table and everyone is seated, we practice breathing: “Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile,” three times.

Sitting at the table with other people, we have a chance to offer an authentic smile of friendship and understanding. It is very easy, but not many people do it. To me, this is the most important practice. We look at each person and smile at him or her. Breathing and smiling together is a very important practice. If the people in a household cannot smile at each other, the situation is very dangerous.

This food reveals our connection with the earth. Each bite contains the life of the sun and the earth. The extent to which our food reveals itself depends on us. We can see and taste the whole universe in a piece of bread! Contemplating our food for a few seconds before eating, and eating in mindfulness, can bring us much happiness.

Once you are standing in front of the sink with your sleeves rolled up and your hands in the warm water, it is really quite pleasant. I enjoy taking my time with each dish, being fully aware of the dish, the water, and each movement of my hands. I know that if I hurry in order to eat dessert sooner, the time of washing dishes will be unpleasant and not worth living. That would be a pity, for each minute, each second of life is a miracle.

We don’t like being so busy, but every time we have a spare moment, we are afraid of being alone with ourselves. We want to escape.

We need to discuss among ourselves how to do it. Do you practice breathing between phone calls? Do you practice smiling while cutting carrots? Do you practice relaxation after hours of hard work? These are practical questions. If you know how to apply meditation to dinner time, leisure time, sleeping time, it will penetrate your daily life, and it will also have a tremendous effect on social concerns. Mindfulness can penetrate the activities of everyday life, each minute, each hour of our daily life, and not just be a description of something far away.

But it is more effective to return to our conscious breathing and just observe it, identifying it silently to ourselves: “Breathing in, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me. Breathing out, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me.” Calling a feeling by its name, such as “anger,” “sorrow,” “joy,” or “happiness,” helps us identify it clearly and recognize it more deeply.

To suppress or chase it away is to suppress or chase away our self. When we are joyful, we are the joy. When we are angry, we are the anger. When anger is born in us, we can be aware that anger is an energy in us, and we can accept that energy in order to transform it into another kind of energy. When we have a compost bin filled with organic material which is decomposing and smelly, we know that we can transform the waste into beautiful flowers. At first, we may see the compost and the flowers as opposite, but when we look deeply, we see that the flowers already exist in the compost, and the compost already exists in the flowers.

Our conscious, reasoning mind knows that negative feelings such as anger, fear, and regret are not wholly acceptable to ourselves or society, so it finds ways to repress them, to push them into remote areas of our consciousness in order to forget them. Because we want to avoid suffering, we create defense mechanisms that deny the existence of these negative feelings and give us the impression we have peace within ourselves. But our internal formations are always looking for ways to manifest as destructive images, feelings, thoughts, words, or behavior.

If the other person is not happy, we will not be happy either. To transform the other person’s knots will help bring about our own happiness as well. A wife can create internal formations in her husband, and a husband can do so in his wife, and if they continue to create knots in each other, one day there will be no happiness left. Therefore, as soon as a knot is created, the wife, for example, should know that a knot has just been tied in her. She should not overlook it.

We know that gas is dangerous—it can kill us if we are not mindful. But we also know that we need the gas in order to cook, so we do not hesitate to bring it into our homes. The same is true of electricity. We could get electrocuted by it, but when we are mindful, it can help us, and there is no problem, because we know something about the suchness of electricity. A person is the same. If we do not know enough about the suchness of that person, we may get ourselves into trouble. But if we know, then we can enjoy each other very much and benefit a lot from one another. The key is knowing a person’s suchness. We do not expect a person always to be a flower. We have to understand his or her garbage as well.

Most of us are victims of a kind of living that is not mindful, and the practice of mindful living, of meditation, can stop these kinds of suffering and end the transmission of such sorrow to our children and grandchildren. We can break the cycle by not allowing these kinds of seeds of suffering to be transmitted to our children, our friends, or anyone else. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=871))\n- When we look at our parents with compassion, often we see that our parents are only victims who never had the chance to practice mindfulness. They could not transform the suffering in themselves. But if we see them with compassionate eyes, we can offer them joy, peace, and forgiveness. In fact, when we look deeply, we discover that it is impossible to drop all identity with our parents. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=889))\n- Every time a seed has an occasion to manifest itself, it produces new seeds of the same kind. If we are angry for five minutes, new seeds of anger are produced and deposited in the soil of our unconscious mind during those five minutes. That is why we have to be careful in selecting the kind of life we lead and the emotions we express. When I smile, the seeds of smiling and joy have come up. ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=903))\n- We often ask, “What’s wrong?” Doing so, we invite painful seeds of sorrow to come up and manifest. We feel suffering, anger, and depression, and produce more such seeds. We would be much happier if we tried to stay in touch with the healthy, joyful seeds inside of us and around us. We should learn to ask, “What’s not wrong?” and be in touch with that. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=943))\n- Life is filled with many wonders, like the blue sky, the sunshine, the eyes of a baby. Our breathing, for example, can be very enjoyable. I enjoy breathing every day. But many people appreciate the joy of breathing only when they have asthma or a stuffed-up nose. We don’t need to wait until we have asthma to enjoy our breathing. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=947))\n- Awareness of the precious elements of happiness is itself the practice of right mindfulness. Elements like these are within us and all around us. In each second of our lives we can enjoy them. If we do so, seeds of peace, joy, and happiness will be planted in us, and they will become strong. The secret to happiness is happiness itself.

You look into the reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or our family, we blame the other person. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=955))\n- Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and arguments. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change. ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=958))\n- When you understand, you cannot help but love. You cannot get angry. To develop understanding, you have to practice looking at all living beings with the eyes of compassion. When you understand, you cannot help but love. And when you love, you naturally act in a way that can relieve the suffering of people. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=971))\n- When we are in contact with another’s suffering, a feeling of compassion is born in us. Compassion means, literally, “to suffer with.” ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=992))\n- We can also meditate on the suffering of those who cause us to suffer. Anyone who has made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need to follow our breathing and look deeply, and naturally we will see his suffering. A part of his difficulties and sorrows may have been brought about by his parents’ lack of skill when he was still young. But his parents themselves may have been victims of their parents; the suffering has been transmitted from generation to generation and been reborn in him. If we see that, we will no longer blame him for making us suffer, because we know that he is also a victim.

Then, while you hold him or her in your arms, breathe three times consciously, and you will enjoy your hugging more than ever before.

Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot be here either.

Doing so will help us maintain mindfulness of our good fortune, and perhaps one day we will find ways to do something to help change the system of injustice that exists in the world.

To transform our situation is also to transform our minds. To transform our minds is also to transform our situation, because the situation is mind, and mind is situation.

For example, if a number of people in South Africa could go to each side and understand their suffering, and communicate that to the other sides, that would be very helpful. We need links. We need communication. Practicing nonviolence is first of all to become nonviolence. Then when a difficult situation presents itself, we will react in a way that will help the situation. This applies to problems of the family as well as to problems of society. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=1322))\n- “I am sorry, I hurt you out of my ignorance, out of my lack of mindfulness, out of my lack of skillfulness. I will try my best to change myself. I don’t dare to say anything more to you.” Sometimes, we do not have the intention to hurt, but because we are not mindful or skillful enough, we hurt someone. ([Location 1368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=1368))\n- The second thing to do is to try to bring out the best part in ourselves, the part of the flower, to transform ourselves. That is the only way to demonstrate what you have just said. When you have become fresh and pleasant, the other person will notice very soon. Then when there is a chance to approach that person, you can come to her as a flower and she will notice immediately that you are quite different. You may not have to say anything. Just seeing you like that, she will accept you and forgive you. That is called “speaking with your life and not just with words.” ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0038AUYSW\u0026location=1371))\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T22:54:09.686473094Z","tags":null},"/notes/literature-notes/Books/Problem-Solving-Estrategico":{"title":"Problem Solving Estrategico","content":"\n```\nPropone afrontar la resolución de problemas de manera sistemática siguiendo un proceso estructurado\n```\n\n***\n**Author**: [Giorgio Nardone]\n**Source**: [[ ]]  \n**Tags**:  #books\n***\n\n# 1. Si hay un problema también hay una solución\n\nEl libro comienza con la historia de Alejandro Magno enfrentándose a cómo tomar una fortaleza enclavada entre dos altos picos totalmente inexpugnable.\n\nLa historia cuenta que se reúne al equipo de sabios de distintos perfiles (team problem solving) y reformulan el problema. Lo reenfocan diciendo que el problema es cómo ganar una posición ventajosa en altura en los picos más elevados. Lo resuelven inventando la escalada en cordada y haciendo que suban arqueros que matan a los guardas y el gobernador rinde la fortaleza.\n\nPasos que toman:\n- Definen el contexto de la situación\n- Identificar soluciones fallidas\n- Imaginar escenario ideal de éxito \u003e Redefinen el problema. De conquistar la fortaleza a conquistar la cima\n- Definido el problema de llegar a la cima inventan solución\n- Para ello parten de la solución ideal y fraccionan el problema en subclases que van resolviendo hasta crear solución total.\n\nLa lógica estratégica desarrolla modelos de intervención basados en el objetivo a alcanzar de manera sistemática, no son destellos de un genio.\n\n# 2. Qué es el problem solving\n\nKarl Popper y el proceso de investigación científica:\n1. Surge un problema\n2. Se estudian intentos de solución que se han llevado a cabo\n3. Se buscan soluciones alternativas\n4. Se aplican\n5. Se evalúan efectos\n6. Se ajusta estrategia hasta hacerla eficaz\n\nEl problema solving es la tecnología para encontrar soluciones mientras que la ciencia busca dar explicaciones a los fenómenos que estudia. Es por tanto un saber operativo (como el conocimiento lógico o el tecnologíco) vs el saber especulativo (filosófico o el científico).\n\nEl problem solver debe usar el conocimiento lógico tecnología operativo para sus intervenciones aunque obviamente éstos se retroalimentan con el filosófico/científico.\n\n\u003e Ante un problema tendemos a buscar la explicación más que la solución.\n\nLa solución no tiene necesidad de la explicación previa del problema. Necesario orientarse a la solución problema presente en lugar de buscar la explicación en el pasado.\n\nEl estudio de las causas pasadas es contraproducente para la búsqueda de soluciones presentes. Se refiere a no perderse en los porqué y entender cómo funciona.\n\n# Cómo funciona el problem solving estratégico?\n\n## Definir el problema.\n\nMediante el uso de las 5 preguntas. En qué consiste, quién está implicado, dónde se produce, cuando y cómo funciona.\n\nBuscar distintas perspectivas para definirlo para evitar caer en los sesgos propios. \n\nPara descubrir la solución es necesaria la redefinición repetitiva de las carácteristicas del problema. Otra forma de entender esta fase es buscar un reductor de la complejidad, redefinir el problema como hizo Alejandro Magno.\n\n## Determinar y acordar el objetivo\n\nConcretar un objetivo con los clientes para que la intervención pueda evaluarse como exitosa.\n\nEn caso de hacerlo en equipo sirve para hacer copartícipes del proyecto y hacer team building.\n\n##  Evaluar las soluciones intentadas\n\nIdentificación y evaluación de los intentos fallidos nos libera de la tendencia de buscar soluciones sin haber investigado lo que no funciona. Este análisis nos puede mostrar que dinámicas perpetúan y mantienen el problema y cuáles lo pueden cambiar. Es decir permiten conocer el funcionamiento del problema.\n\nEvaluar las estrategias intentadas supone:\n- Identificar lo que no funciona\n- Identificar lo que funciona\n\n\nSi lo que funciona es reproducible ya tendremos una solución. Sin embargo es habitual que soluciones pasadas no funcionen en el presente. \n\n## La técnica del cómo empeorar\n\nResulta de responder: `si quisiera empeorar la situación cómo lo haría?` La mente al evaluar las soluciones fallidas busca, por contraste, soluciones alternativas. Es paradójico, pero esta estrategia desbloquea la creatividad al bloquear la atención racional en la generación de soluciones para fallar.\n\n## La técnica del escenario más allá del prroblema \nconsiste en identificar todas las características de cómo sería la situación si la estrategia de resolución hubiese funcionado. Nos permite ver cosas que desde el presente nos cuestan más.\n\n\n\n## La táctica de los pequeños pasos\n\nTodo gran viaje comienza por un primer paso. Empezar por un pequeño cambio inicia un movimiento que además evita la resistencia al cambio que existe en cualquier sistema que está en un equilibrio desde hace tiempo. \n\n## La técnica del escalador\nSe parte de la cima de la montaña y se establecen las rutas hasta la base. De esa forma te aseguras no desviarte del objetivo.\n\nSe parte del objetivo final y se pasa al estadio anterior y así hasta el punto de partida. Se fracciona el objetivo en microobjetivos. Se parte del cambio más pequeño y concreto posible.\n\n\n`la enseñanza como una forma velada de introducción al cambio, especialmente útil cuando se trabaja con un grupo de personas de una misma organización pero que tienen ideas diferentes.`\n\n## Corregir el tiro progresivamente\n\nHay problema complejos que requieren soluciones sucesivas. En estos casos hay que empezar por el problema más accesible, luego continuar por el siguiente, etc. \n\nEs importante mantener visión global y las interrelaciones. \n\n![[IMG_20220410_231549.jpg]]\n\n# Arte o tecnología\nTrata sobre la estratagema, ambivalencia o lógica no ordinaria.

Once we see clearly what’s going on in the moment, we can then choose whether and how to act on what we’re seeing. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=260))\n- whatever gets our attention flourishes, so if we lavish attention on the negative and inconsequential, they can overwhelm the positive and the meaningful. But if we do the opposite, refusing to deal with or acknowledge what’s difficult and painful, pretending it doesn’t exist, then our world is out of whack. Whatever doesn’t get our attention withers—or retreats below conscious awareness, where it may still affect our lives. In a perverse way, ignoring the painful and the difficult is just another way of feeding the wolf. Meditation teaches us to open our attention to all of human experience and all parts of ourselves. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=282))\n- the feeling of having your attention fractured by job and family, the enticement of electronic diversions, or the chatter of your mind—that morning’s spat with your mate replaying in your head, a litany of worries about the future or regrets about the past, a nervous endless-loop recitation of the day’s to-do list. Parts of that mental soundtrack may be old tapes that were instilled in childhood and have been playing so long we’ve nearly tuned them out of conscious awareness. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=287))\n- Meditation teaches us to focus and to pay clear attention to our experiences and responses as they arise, and to observe them without judging them. That allows us to detect harmful habits of mind that were previously invisible to us. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=300))\n- All forms of meditation strengthen and direct our attention through the cultivation of three key skills—concentration, mindfulness, and compassion or lovingkindness. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=306))\n- The practice entails paying attention to each in-and-out breath, and when your mind wanders (it will, that’s natural), noticing whatever has captured your attention, then letting go of the thought or feeling without berating yourself for it. You then return to focusing on your breathing. In this way meditation trains us to stay in the moment before us instead of reliving the past or worrying about the future. And it teaches us how to be gentle with ourselves and others, to forgive our lapses and move ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=310))\n- But if we apply mindfulness to the experience of anger, we can safely draw close to the emotion instead of fleeing, and investigate it instead of stonewalling. We notice it without judging it. We can gather more information about what happens when we get mad—what sets off the anger, where it lodges in the body, and what else it also contains, like sadness, fear, or regret. This pause for nonjudgmental acknowledgment creates a bit of peaceful space within which we can make new, different choices about how to respond to something like anger. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=324))\n- Mindfulness helps us get better at seeing the difference between what’s happening and the stories we tell ourselves about what’s happening, stories that get in the way of direct experience. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=331))\n- If you meditate regularly, you also get certain results. I’ve already mentioned some of them, including greater calm, and improved concentration and more connection to others.

These assumptions we make about who we are and the way the world works—what we deserve, how much we can handle, where happiness is to be found, whether or not positive change is possible—all greatly influence how and to what we pay attention. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=398))\n- Assumptions block direct experience and prevent us from gathering information that could bring us comfort and relief, or information that, though saddening and painful, will allow us to make better decisions. ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=406))\n- You’ll stop limiting yourself. When we practice meditation, we often begin to recognize a specific sort of conditioned response—previously undetected restrictions we’ve imposed on our lives. We spot the ways we sabotage our own growth and success because we’ve been conditioned to be content with meager results. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=414))\n- You’ll weather hard times better. Meditation teaches us safe ways to open ourselves to the full range of experience—painful, pleasurable, and neutral—so we can learn how to be a friend to ourselves in good times and bad. During meditation sessions we practice being with difficult emotions and thoughts, even frightening or intense ones, in an open and accepting way, without adding self-criticism to something that already hurts. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=421))\n- You’ll rediscover a deeper sense of what’s really important to you. Once you look beneath distractions and conditioned reactions, you’ll have a clearer view of your deepest, most enduring dreams, goals, and values. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=429))\n- You’ll have a portable emergency resource. Meditation is the ultimate mobile device; you can use it anywhere, anytime, unobtrusively. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=431))\n- You’ll be in closer touch with the best parts of yourself. Meditation practice cultivates qualities such as kindness, trust, and wisdom that you may think are missing from your makeup but are actually just undeveloped or obscured by stress and distractions. You’ll have the chance to access these qualities more easily and frequently. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=435))\n- You’ll recapture the energy you’ve been wasting trying to control the uncontrollable. ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=438))\n- Though we can affect our physical and emotional experiences, we can’t ultimately determine them; we can’t decree what emotions will arise within us. But we can learn through meditation to change our responses to them. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=447))\n- Recognizing what we can’t control (the feelings that arise within us; other people; the weather) helps us have healthier boundaries at work and at home—no more trying to reform everyone all the time. It helps us to stop beating up on ourselves for having perfectly human emotions. It frees energy we expend on trying to control the uncontrollable. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=449))\n- You’ll understand how to relate to change better—to accept that it’s inevitable and believe that it’s possible. Most of us have a mixed, often paradoxical attitude toward change. Some of us don’t think change is possible at all; we believe we’re stuck forever doing things the way we’ve always done them. Some of us simultaneously hope for change and fear it. We want to believe that change is possible, because that means that our lives can get better. But we also have trouble accepting change, because we want to hold on permanently to what’s pleasurable and positive. We’d like difficulties to be fleeting and comfort to stick around. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=452))\n- Everything is impermanent: happiness, sorrow, a great meal, a powerful empire, what we’re feeling, the people around us, ourselves. Meditation helps us comprehend this fact—perhaps the basic truth of human existence, and the one we humans are most likely to balk at or be oblivious to, especially when it comes to the biggest change of all: Mortality happens, whether we like it or not. We grow old and die. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=458))\n- Following our breath while observing how thoughts continually ebb and flow can help us realize that all elements of our experience are in constant flux. During a meditation session, you’ll find it’s natural to go through many ups and downs, to encounter both new delights and newly awakened conflicts that have bubbled up from the unconscious mind. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=464))\n- We can’t control what thoughts and emotions arise within us, nor can we control the universal truth that everything changes. But we can learn to step back and rest in the awareness of what’s happening. That awareness can be our refuge. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=475))\n- “I’ve been through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened,” Mark Twain once said. ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=601))\n- Meditation—training our attention—allows us to find an essential cohesiveness. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=637))\n- Thoughts and feelings will inevitably arise and claim your attention, but you’ll practice repeatedly noticing and letting go of these distractions, then returning your awareness to the in and out of your breath. Breathing, discovering you’ve been distracted, and starting over: simple and manageable. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=694))\n- Some of these thoughts and feelings may be fascinating and delightful; some may make you uncomfortable; some may be deadly dull. You’ll practice letting them all go, without taking the time to judge them. This is a crucial first step in learning how to be more centered and present. ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=696))\n- Everyone who meditates, beginners and longer-term practitioners alike, gets hijacked at times by thoughts and feelings; it’s impossible not to be. But once you see how doable it is to start over, you won’t judge your efforts so harshly. And you’ll learn that starting over and not fruitlessly berating yourself are skills you can bring into your everyday life when you’ve made a mistake or lost sight of your aspirations. You can begin again. ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=700))\n- This act of beginning again is the essential art of the meditation practice. ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=778))\n- If you have to let go of distractions and begin again thousands of times, fine. That’s not a roadblock to the practice—that is the practice. That’s life: starting over, one breath at a time. ([Location 790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=790))\n- Try to bring some of the qualities of concentration you just experienced—presence, calm observation, willingness to start over, and gentleness—to the next activity that you perform at home, at work, among friends, or among strangers. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=797))\n- success in meditation is measured not in terms of what is happening to us but by how we relate to what is happening. Do you calmly observe your sleepiness, anxiety, or distraction? Success. Do you try to stop punishing yourself for feeling these things? Success. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=899))\n- Not paying attention keeps us in an endless cycle of wanting. We move on to the next thing because we aren’t really taking in what we already have; inattention creates an escalating need for stimulation. When we’re keenly aware of what’s happening, we don’t need to grasp for the next great moment of sensation or taste or sound (all the while missing what’s actually here, right in front of us). Nor do we need to postpone our feeling of happiness until a more exciting or more pleasing object comes along, ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=907))\n- His life is a pursuit of a pursuit forever.

If you do so paying very little attention to the sight of it, the feel, the smell and the taste, then eating the apple isn’t likely to be a fulfilling experience. Becoming aware of a mild discontent, you’re likely to blame the apple for being boring and commonplace. It’s easy to miss the fact that the quality of your attention played a major role in your dissatisfaction.

We don’t need to reach out and grab ever more exotic or forbidden fruit. We develop calm and tranquility—and the calmer we get, the more at home we feel with our body and mind, with life as it is. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=938))\n- The point of meditation is not to annihilate thoughts; obviously there are plenty of times in life when thinking is called for—vital, in fact, to our survival. What we hope to learn is the difference between thinking and being lost in thought. We don’t want to stop our thoughts but to change our relationship with them—to be more present and aware when we’re thinking. If we’re aware of what we’re thinking, if we see clearly what’s going on in our minds, then we can choose whether and how to act on our thoughts. ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=973))\n- Thoughts moving through your mind are like clouds moving across the sky. They are not the sky, and the sky remains unchanged by them. The way to be with them is just to watch them go by. That’s not generally how we experience our thoughts, but that’s what you’re working toward. ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=981))\n- Meditation is a microcosm, a model, and a mirror. The skills we practice when we sit are transferable to the rest of our lives. In Week One we used the tool of concentration to steady and focus the mind. Following the breath, we became aware of thoughts, feelings, and sensations. We noted them and let them go without getting swept away by them, without dodging them or ignoring them (as we might normally have done in our busy daily lives), and without berating ourselves for having them. ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1076))\n- DEVELOPING OUR CONCENTRATION helps us steady our attention. The next skill we’ll develop, mindfulness, helps us to free our attention from burdens we may not even know we’re hauling around. ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1122))\n- How many times has an attempt to dodge pain made us miss the sweet parts of bittersweet—the chance to grow in response to a challenge, to help others or accept help from others? How many pleasures escape our notice because we think we need big, dramatic sensations to feel alive? Mindfulness can allow us to experience fully the moment in front of us—what Thoreau calls “the bloom of the present”—and to wake up from neutral so we don’t miss the small, rich moments that add up to a dimensional life. ([Location 1401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1401))\n- Mindfulness isn’t difficult; we just need to remember to do it. ([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1466))\n- Often people think, I don’t have the right kind of mindfulness, the right level of concentration. Progress is not about levels; it’s about frequency. If we can remember to be mindful, if we can add more moments of mindfulness, that makes all the difference. Countless times a day we lose mindfulness and become lost in reaction or disconnected from what is happening. But the moment we recognize that we’ve lost mindfulness, we have already regained it; that recognition is its essence. We can begin again. ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1472))\n- I’VE HEARD SOME WONDERFUL EXPLANATIONS of mindfulness. Sylvia Boorstein, a writer and teacher, calls it “awake attention to what is happening inside and outside so we can respond from a place of wisdom.” The Vietnamese Zen teacher and poet Thich Nhat Hanh says, “I like to define mindfulness as the energy that helps us to be there one hundred percent; the energy of our true presence.” ([Location 1479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1479))\n- core group of unhealthy human tendencies that are obstacles to happiness. They’re the states of mind that distract us in meditation practice, and trip us up in the rest of our lives. Broadly speaking, they are: desire, aversion, sloth, restlessness, and doubt. ([Location 1551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1551))\n- You may recognize that the thoughts and emotions that come up in this week’s meditations are part of recurring patterns—that you’re hearing a lot of what I call old tapes, the familiar, habitual mental soundtrack I mentioned in the introduction. It’s helpful to acknowledge these tapes of ours, perhaps even to good-naturedly name them: Oh, ([Location 1752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1752))\n- During the meditation about a difficult situation, as I pictured that day, I realized how familiar that ‘one false move and I’m doomed’ feeling is. I don’t know yet why I play that tape—but at least now I know it happens.” ([Location 1765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1765))\n- The fourth-century Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu told this story: There was a man so displeased by the sight of his own shadow and footsteps that he determined to get rid of both by running away from them. But every time he put down his foot, there was another step, and his shadow kept up with him without the slightest difficulty. He thought he must not be running fast enough. So he ran faster and faster and faster, without stopping, until he finally dropped dead of exhaustion. He failed to realize that if he merely stepped into the shade, his shadow would vanish, and if he sat down and stayed still, there would be no more footsteps. ([Location 1777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1777))\n- Practicing mindfulness meditation is making the choice to be still—to step into the quiet shade instead of running away from difficult thoughts and feelings. We sometimes call meditation non-doing. Instead of being swept away by our usual conditioned reactions, we’re quiet and watchful, fully present with what is, touching it deeply, being touched by it, and seeing what is happening in the simplest and most direct fashion possible. ([Location 1782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1782))\n- And being mindful of the moment doesn’t mean that we give up savoring memories or setting goals. I like to quote Thich Nhat Hanh: “To dwell in the here and now does not mean you never think about the past or responsibly plan for the future,” he says. “The idea is simply not to allow yourself to get lost in regrets about the past or worries about the future. If you are firmly grounded in the present moment, the past can be an object of inquiry, the object of your mindfulness and concentration. You can attain many insights by looking into the past. But you are still grounded in the present moment.” ([Location 1880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1880))\n- When we know our thoughts, we neither dodge them nor get lost in them. Instead, we can decide when and if we should act on them; we can better discern which actions will lead to happiness and which to suffering. Meditation allows us to see and accept ourselves as we are in the moment—sometimes hot-tempered and sometimes mellow, sometimes cowardly and sometimes strong, sometimes ashamed and sometimes proud, sometimes confused and sometimes clear. ([Location 1947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=1947))\n- The customary phrases are usually variations on May I Be Safe (or May I Be Free from Danger), May I Be Happy, May I Be Healthy, May I Live with Ease—may daily life not be a struggle. ([Location 2047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004IARYIY\u0026location=2047))\n- If we’re in the habit of seeing only the negative in ourselves and missing the positive, we can experiment with turning our attention to the goodness within us. If we’re in the habit of ignoring the humanity of strangers or people we don’t know well, we can experiment with being open and aware, taking an interest, connecting. If we’re in the habit of not really listening while conversing, we can experiment with being more fully present with the next person we speak to. If we’re in the habit of classifying and dismissing people based on what we think we know about them, we can experiment with listening with fresh ears, giving our full attention. If we’re wholehearted, open, interested, we may find that people surprise us.

An optimal response in terms of adaptability to this context involves shared consciousness and decentralised empowered execution.\n```\n\n***\n**Author**: [Stanley McChrystal]  \n**Source**: [[ ]]  \n**Tags**:  #triage\n***\n\nIn order to adapt its strategy and processes in a complex changing environment they embraced:\n\n- shared consciousness: transparent information sharing\n- empowered execution: decentralised decision making authority.\n\nThis yielded a team of teams. Agility of small teams applied to thousands across countries switching from hierarchies and silos that fostered efficiency in the XX century.\n\nMaps replaced by whiteboards used to draw mutable relations between things. They found tangled networks instead of traditional hierarchical structures.\n\nThey saw this pack of clear structure as a design that should lead to chaos. Learned that an organisation can only be assessed within the surrounding environment. \n\nZeitgeist: interconnectedness, ability to transmit information instantly allow small groups to have global influence.\n\nAdmiral Nelson greatest victory is explained by his innovative managerial approach in which he provided space for initiative and trusted his strategy to his well trained captains. (page 30)\n\n==Limiting factor (limfac)== is an element in a situation that holds you back. In their case was traditional military management.\n\n# Standardization and taylorism\n\nTaylor was a gifted privileged kid, probe to optimise things since childhood and that later stated that 6 months working at a factory at age of 17 was the best education experience he ever had.\n\nHe realised that every worker has its own way to do things and soon realised that there must be \"one best way\". This is the seed oh his theory, scientific management.  In order to find it out he setup experiments aimed at not working harder but more productively.\n\nFor Taylor managers were research scientists and architects of efficiency.\n\nViews of management by Taylor's disciples. Management is:\n- Plan\n- organize\n- command staff\n- coordinate\n- report\n- budget\n\nAlthough his view of workers as lazy People in need of incentives and planners on top of the in order to be motivated, Taylorism Is still much alive in our quest of how to do things better.\n\n\u003e Appreciating the magnitude of what one does not know is one of the main topics of this book\n\n# From complicated to complex\n Technological development has flavoured our abilities to track, measure and communicate but it has also increased complexity making world less predictable.\n\nComplex  systems are those densely interconnected and that interact so frequently that they are really hard to untangle. In addition, those dense interactions cause nonlinear change in the system. An event is unpredictable because it is the result of many causes linked by direct and indirect paths.\n\nComplex systems are fickle and volatile. \nComplex systems: Weather (the butterfly effect by Lorenz), national economies...\n\nComplicated problems have many parts but they can be broken down in a series of deterministic relationships.\n\nWarren Beaver seminal paper \"Science and complexity\"\n\nHayek comments on impossibility to reduce National economies to mechanical systems as markets are the result of decisions of millions of people.\n\nOne strategy to solve complicated problems is breaking the process down into components.\n\nA key difference between complicated and complex is the possibility of predicting the outcome within a time span (ex. Weather in a day, in a year)\n\nBig data provides great insights to gain knowledge on the drivers of complex systems but it does not really improve the long term forecasts. For instance we may know how a Covid outbreak started but it is really difficult to where the next one is occurring.\n\n\n==Decentralisation with coherence==\n\nIn complex environments resilience is key factor for succes. Command and control strategies are usually counterproductive. Instead the strategy should be focus on building resilience. Anti fragile systems benefit from shocks Vs fragile systems that suffer great damage.\n\nIn an uncontrolled quest for optimization we can confront the ugly truth of reducing the resilience of the system. For instance, Zillow instant buyer disregard the trope \" know that we don't know\".\n\nRobustness is about strengthening components of the system. Resilience is about linking them in a way that allows them to reconfigure in response to change.\n\n\n\u003e Efficiency is doing things right, effectiveness is doing the right things. Peter Drucker\n\nRules and limitations that prevents accidents, limit creativity. And sometimes attachment to procedure makes you lose track of what matters (purpose).\n\nBreaking vertical silos was the first step to create a true network of teams that shared information.\n\nGreat teams bonds are built on the trust between members. This trust creates dense connectivity in the team, allowing them to quickly adayto changing environments.\n\nIn simple work environment, workers only need to know what the of their position is. In complex environments, it is important that the team is contextual aware of the overall picture and company strategy.\n\n\nMECE (Mutually Exclusive and Collectively exhaustive) covers all the scope without redundancy. Overlapping functions are inefficient but provides context and flexibility to the team.\n\nBreaking silos between teams by increasing its connectivity, specially in the fault lines (spaces between teams). \n\n# Command of teams\nHow to scale the adaptability of teams across entire organization? How to ensure coordination within the superstructure by increasing trust and purpose without creating chaos?\n\nRobin Dunbar: number of people we can trust, from 100 to 230. Malcolm Gladwell \"Rule of 150\" in his book Outliers. These figures might indicate why the goal of a team might not overlap to the goal of the superstructure it serves. \n\nAs a team grows the number of links to be managed increases exponentially. Team dynamics are delicate and adding new members puts them to test. See the book Leading Teams by Richard Hackman\n\n# Team of teams\n\nCreating meaningful connections in a large organisation as those existing among team members is not easy task.the key is representation. ==You need everyone to know someone on every team.==\n\nLack of information sharing between teams causes breakdowns. These breakdowns are not of not of components but of the integration between them  (==\"interface failures\"==)\n\nNASA Apollo program managerial foundation by George Mueller. Joint cognition like a nervous system. Forced managers and engineers to communicate daily with their functional counterparts in other teams. Daily analysis and quick data exchange via a central control group. \n\nContractors in house along with the resident engineers embraced and understood the Apollo project in its integrity. Systems thinking proposes that one cannot understand part of a system without a rudimentary understanding of the whole.\n\nNASAS managerial system showed that in a domain with great intercependence and uncertainty, contextual understanding is key. Silos provide efficiency gains but interface failures increase costs. \n\n# Systems thinking\nEducation Vs training. Education requires understanding, which allows us to face almost any problem. Training is focused on singular topics that might only be useful for particular issues.\n\nPeople cooperate if they can see the interdependent nature of the environment. That requires having insights on how other teams work and how all pieces fit together by incorporating a knowledge pool.\n\nEach team needs to have an overall understanding of the environment while keeping its own set of capabilities. \"Generalized awareness and specialized expertise\"\n\nThe role of physical arrangement of teams at offices is undeniable. Open plans foster spontaneous interaction and knowledge sharing.\n\nIn the quest of shared consciousness they increased information sharing and changed the briefing processes between juniors and seniors showing newbies how a problem is tackled in real time.\n\nCultural barriers and each team's own narrow perspective posed the main challenges for shared consciousness. This meant creating relationships instead of just seeing other teams as separate forces that get and give.\n\nEmbedding program, a team member spend sometime inside other team to learn how to see war from the other team perspective. \n\nLiaisons, or interfaces, were intermediate roles that connected teams. Liaison members needed to be provided by deep support by the central team in order to be of value for their hosts.\n\nGM was a mess in terms of management, chaotic and lacking coordination and transversal organizer. Alfred Sloan changed the situation by introducing \"decentralised operations and coordinated control\". What we call today as silos, hierarchical command and control structure. This led to great market share gains from 1920 to 1960 but in the 70s it's lac of flexibility to adapt cars to customers chanfi go tasted caused serios troubles. \n\nFord approach, \"working together\" brought by ex responsible of Boeing 777,Mullaly. Ensured systematic transparency and forced interaction (live update 3D model of boeing that could be consulted by any engineer). Integrated designers and engineers as japanese used to do.\n\n\u003e Working together always works. It always works. They have to be interdependent with one another. - Mullalya\n\n# Breaking silos \n\nEmbracing intercependence. Horizontal collaboration foster enterprise effectiveness. Collective intelligence depends on the connection among individuals and the 2 major drivers of idea flow are:\n- Engagement within a team\n- Exploration, frequent contact with other units.\n\nIn order to replace the old silo based system by shared consciousness system two things are needed:\n- Participatory transparency: holistic awareness\n- Internal connectivity across teams: embedding and liason programs.\n\n# Hands off\n\nAlthough managers love to take final decisions, sometimes they trust their teams so much that most of the time they just follow recommendations by team leaders. In that case, manager's approval only adds delay to the process.\n\nAlthough communication flowed freely among teams and many people knew how to \"do the right thing\", decision taking was slow. Avoid the team to ask for permission for routine task. In that case the leader must state clearly thoughts and philosophy on those situations so the team can make the call independently. `cost of delay \u003c cost of errors caused by removing supervisor`\n\nEmpowerment generates intrinsic task motivation. On the other hand micromanagement costs are higher than ever as the interdependence of issues makes lots of situations unpredictable, thus causing heavy deviation from plans. In those situations, empowered teams are the more agile response. \n\nEmpowerment is achieved by delegating decisions on the team and publicly rewarding their initiative. Even when failing. A necessary condition for empowerment to work is contextual understanding.\n\n\u003e In the old model, subordinates provide information and leaders disseminated commands. We reversed it: we had our leaders provide information so that subordinates armed with context, understanding and connectivity, could take initiative and make decisions. \n\n\n# From chess master to gardener\n\nThe chess player commands the different pieces following a strategy. The pieces don't have a general overview of the chessboard, only the master has the necessary context.\n\nA gardener creates the necessary environment to vegetables to grow, but it cannot directly command the growing. Itgst context the main responsibility involves maintaining the teamwork conditions needed. \n\nNothing is heard until is said several times. Only when you hear your own words echoed by subordinates you can be certain the message has been delivered.\n\n\u003e perhaps an organisation sells widgets and the leader finds thar she loves everything about widgets  -designing, building and marketing then; that's still not where the leader is most needed. The leader first responsible is to the whole.\n\nEmpowered execution requires shared consciousness. Empowering people without context leads to havoc.\n\n![[IMG_20220308_233052.jpg]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T22:54:09.686473094Z","tags":null},"/notes/literature-notes/Books/The-Culture-Code":{"title":"The Culture Code","content":"\n```\n\n```\n\n***\n**Author**: [[ ]]  [Daniel Coyle]\n**Source**: [[ ]]  https://danielcoyle.com/the-culture-code/\n**Tags**:  #triage\n***\n\n# Build safety \n\nSuccessful groups feel like family, not like friends, team or tribe.\n\nPatterns of interaction with chemistry:\n- Close physical proximity\n- Eye contac\n- Physical touch\n- Short energetic exchanges (no long speech)\n- Everybody talks to everyone\n- Few interruption\n- Lots of questions\n- Intensive active listening \n- Humor\n- Attentive courtesies\n\nBelonging cues: behaviours that create safe connection in groups.

We call this the constraint—or bottleneck. Either term works. Whatever you call it, until you create a trusted system to manage the flow of work to the constraint, the constraint is constantly wasted, which means that the constraint is likely being drastically underutilized.

In the Theory of Constraints, this is typically implemented by something called Drum-Buffer-Rope.

Alex moved Herbie to the front of the line to prevent kids from going on too far ahead.

What business want to achieve in which data can help business suceed.\n\n5 strategic use case areas:\n1. How data can help everyone in an organisation make better and faster decisions\n2. Using data to gain customer and market insights. Understand your customers \u003e successful in markets\n3. Smarter products and services. Personalisation.\n4. Using data to improve and automate the way a business operates\n5. Data monetisation. Turning data into income. \n\nCreate a strong business case for using data. \n\n# 1. Data driven decision making\nTwo key elements:\n1. Self-service. A company gives more people access to more data so they can answer their business questions. \n2. Curated dashboards. Idenbtify and communicate the strategic data sets and metrics. Identify information needs. \n\t1. identify Key business questions\n\t\t1. Analyse strategy and goals\n\t\t2.

Build the right culture of delegated decision making\nEnsure an improved data literacy. Training and emphasis on developing data-related skills\n\nProvide the right tools to your employees. Once the tools are in place, additionatl training and support is required. Data café in Walmart or data translators between business and analytics teams. \n\nProvide access to the right quality data. Use single source of truth, invest in master data management, conduct data audits.\n\n### Asking key business questions first\n\n\u003e Good questions outrank easy answers. Paul Samuelson\n\nData driven decision making starts by defining the questions that need to be answered. Then we need to define how to use data to answer the questions in an informed way\n\n`Key Business Questions`  capture business information needs and are the biggest unaswered questions or what managers need to know about their organisation. Focus our attention on the questions that really matter and provide guidance for collecting meaningful and relevant data.\n\nThe power of clear Key Business Questions.\n- Telecom wanted to know most profitable customers and profitability over the long run. Rephrased as CLTV. How loyal are profitable customers. Churn rates. \n\nGood questions lead to good answers.\n\n#### How do you develop good business questions?\n\n1. Start with strategy. Clarify strategic objectives and start developing KBQs. The fewer KBQs the better.\n2. Engage people in the KBQ design. List \u003e subject matter experts \u003e \n3. Try to phrase your KBQs as open questions. Open up the dialogue. \n4. Focus your KBQs on the present and the future. \n5. Keep your KBQs short and clear. \n6. Refine your KBQs by using them. \n\n### Give people access to data\nYou democratise data driven decision making. Avoid analytics team bottleneck. \n\n### Curating the most important data insights\nFor the most strategic data needs we need curated dashboards. A well design dashboard helps monitoring the key business goals. \nRemember not everyone can read graphs. Include text based descriptions. \nIt allows companies to control narrative and data storytelling. \n\n\n# 2. Using data to understand your customers \n\nData allows companies to understand their customers and the market conditions they are operating in.\n\nIntuitions, past experiences, knowledge passed down through previous generations. Getting big catch depends more on luch than on facts. \n\nA butcher shop in London using beacons to track pedestrian inflow and testing different signs.\n\nNetflix everything they do is based on data and AI.

Identifying data use case\n\nYou have to link data use case to business strategy to ensure data delivers maximum value for your business. \nLooking what your business is trying to achieve, identify potential solutions through the use of data.\nDont limit yourself to a small number of use cases at this stage, we will be narrowing down options in the second step. Now we need to explore the many ways in which data could help your organization. \n\nCan come from any of the discussed areas:\n1. How data can help everyone in an organisation make better and faster decisions\n2. Using data to gain customer and market insights. Understand your customers \u003e successful in markets\n3. Smarter products and services. Personalisation.\n4. Using data to improve and automate the way a business operates\n5. Data monetisation. Turning data into income. \n\n##  Link to a strategic goal\n\nIt is vital to link each use case to a business strategic goal. If you cannot question yourself if it is really worth the expense. \n\n```\nHow would this use of data help the busienss achieve its objectives, grow and prosper?\n```\n\nTemplate for each use case:\n\n### Data objective\n\n### Measure of success or KPIs\nWhich business metrics we can track progress. \n\n### Business ownership\nWho in the business would be responsible and assume overall ownership of the project.\n\n### Users and data customers\nLearning from the insights\n\n### Required data\nStructured data, unstructured data. Internal and external data.\n\n### Data governance\nKeep data safe and who owns it. \n\n### Data analysis\nTurn data to insights\n\n### Technology\nIdentifying which software and hardware to use\n\n### Skills and capacity\nDo we need to train in house, use in house people or outsource?\n\n### Implimentation and change management\nAnticipate road blocks\n\n\n## 2. Prioritize use case\n\nDon-t be tempted to prioritize more than 2 or 3. \n\nLookg for quick wins, short-term smaller data projects. Demonstrate people the value of data, win people over and saw the seeds for bigger projects.\n\nIdentify and prioritizing data use cases should be done at least yearly but better each quarter.  \n\nLook for common themes, complementarities and overlaps in terms of data requirements, data govbernance, tech, skills and technology. Address them holistically.\n\n# Sourcing and collecting data\n\nHow to collect the right data? \n\nThe art is automated as much as possible. Find the right type of data that fits your needs. \n\nDifferent types of data:\n- Structured \n- Unstructured \n\n- Internal\n- External\n\nFind the best combination to get the most useful insights for your business\n\n## Structured vs unstructured\nStructured is organised data, can be put in tabular form easily. \nUnstructured, unorganised data, cannot be put in tabular form easily. 80-90%.\n\nSemi-structured have some elements of structure (metadata) for instance photo metadata. \n\n## Internal vs external\nInternal data: Owned or collected by the organization. Useful in the long run and it is useful advantage. Usually cheap or free to access. \nExternal data: A third party data. All information which exists outsiede. Publicly availabe or pivately owned by 3rd parties. Data brokers. Paid in most cases, less control of the quality, less reliable for strategically important and business critical insights. Ponder the risks and benefits from external data. \n\nUsually companies rely too much on internal data, can biased perspective. The sweet spot usually requires a mix of internal and external data.\n\n\n## Types of data\n\nDigial trace of what we do, how owte\n\n- Activity data\n- Conversation data\n- Photo data\n- Video data\n- Sensor data\n\n## Meta data\nData that describes other data. Metadata summarises data about p. Helps IT systems uncover what they are looking for. \nGives a competitive advantage\nNot prioritised right now\n\nMetadata management structure. Drives digital asset management. Allows analysts to unlock meaning in Big data. \n\n## The importance of real time\nStreaming data and analytics. Competitive edge on competitors. \n\nDynamic data that is generated continously from a variety of sources. It allows real time insights, better decision making and more personalized customer services.\n\nStreaming analytics analytics while the data is in the stream, not when it has been stored. It allows proactivity, proactivity and agility. \n\nUse cases examples:\n- Maintenance, identify issues in real time\n- Health care\n- Retail\n- Social media\n- Finance\n- Energy\n\n## Gathering internal data\n\nOnce we have identified the data you need already exists. If it is not available are we able to collect it internally?\n\nCollect conversation data. \nText-based conversations.\nSurveys\nPhoto and video data\nTransaction data, very easy to access and analyse.\nFinancial data\n\nSensors can be incorporated into almost anything. \n\n## Accessing external data\nData as a business commodity. Even very specific data is being collected and sold.\nCan be acquiered for free from government datasets, social media platforms, google trends, weather data. \n\n## Sources of external data\nWorld bank, IMF, ML archive...\n\n## When the data you want does not exist\nYou will have to find a away to generate and collect it. It might be the source of a competitive advantage. \nSprigg mobile test centers with IoT to measure soil conditions. \n\n# Data governance, ethics and trust\nInstead of becoming a valuable asset it can become a liability. Legal and result compliance\nRegulations are being introduced. \n\nORganizations need to be careful with:\nData ownership\n\tOwn data that is essential to your business. Own or not own? It it easy to own internal data, but with external data can create future problems for your business.\n\nHow do i ensure the correct rights are in place. \n\nInclude your legal team when dealing with data privacy. \n\nCase study Royal Bank. Personoly give some real value back to customers and deliver value back to them. Develop trust to give value to customers. A core element in the data strategy. Ensure customers that the data isnt used against them. \n\n# Building the dasta competencies in your organisation\n\n## Skills shortage\nSupply of capable DS is low\nMore data related programs in the market\nPoor definition of the job role\n\n## Building internal skills and competencies\nHire data professionals and help them grow.\nIdentify individuals inside organization.\n\n## Outsourcing your data analysis\nHire external services if\n- Unable to hire at decent price\n- No SMEs in house\nFocus on skills transfers from consultants to the team.\n\n## Leadership challenges\n\nA good leader is aware of the intelligence revolution and understandce its importance.\nA business leader appraches data analysis and AI strategically and not technically\nIdentifies how to bes use AI and data analysis in their business\nFInds a strategic sponsor for AI and data analysis initiatives. \n\nChief AI Officer. \n- Sets the vision for using AI\n- Educates about the importance of AI\n- Places the ethical frameworks for AI usage\n- Builds the right skills, capacity and tech infrastructure\n- Oversees execution and delivery\n- Manages stakeholders\n\n\n# Executing and revisiting your strategy\n\nThe execution of a firm's data strategy needs to start at the top. The senior leadership team needs to have buy-in and if that happens, everyone else will follow. It usually creates a top down ripple effect where the importance of data as a core asset is understood.\n\nAttitudes that kill the data strategy in its inception:\n- We are not a data company. Every business is a data business. \n- Working with data and implementing a data strategy in practice is too expensive.\n- We already have more data than we need. \n- Everyone else is already ahead of us. \n- Our customers aren't interested.\n\nEducation and concrete examples of the industry you are operating in usually works great to achieve sponsors.\n\n## Why data strategies fail\n\nData strategy needs to be in sync with the goal of the company. \n\n- Lack of communication\n- Staff engangement\n- Lack of communications between teams. ==End-to-end process owners==\n- Lack of specialized workforce\n\nWhat you need in general to prevent these issues is good communication and a high level of buy-in across the organization.\n\n\n## Creating a data culture\n\nBuilding a robust data culture means getting people on board with the firm's data strategy. \n\nThere is a culture shift for many organizations to go from relying exclusively on their intuition and insticts but on decisions that are justified with data and facts.\n\nOne proven way to establish a strong data culture is to involve some of the brightest employees during the process of forming a data strategy and implementing it. \n\nIf one of your primary aims is to use data to understand your customers better, then it makes sense to involve the head of marketing and key marketing personnel.\n\nIt is important that a firm's leadership team make an effort to engage people in their company's data strategy underlining how will improve the business.\n\nIt is a great idea to showcase examples and studies from other companies to demonstrate how data helped a company in practice, and examples that are from your own industry are even better.\n\nNegativity can be contagious. If people on your team or even worse, entire teams become skeptical and pessimistic, try to understand what problems they have in their work and explain how data can be helpful to make their job easier.\n\nBuild trust, be transparent. \n\n## Revisiting the data strategy\nReview it periodically.\n1. Do you have different business needs? The faster industry changes, the more often we should review our data strategy.\n2. Has technology evolved?\n\n\n# Using data for good\nOpportunity to tackle the greatest challenges.

In order to change culture you need to change people's minds. Make them curious, open to change and collaborative. To reach all of this you need to have purpose and intention, you need to make employees accountable by building trust (being transparent and vulnerable) and you must be appreciative when they make the right things.\n\n```\n\n***\n**Author**: [[ ]]  \n**Source**: [[ ]]  https://open.spotify.com/episode/6GsIPCSEZ3l6AVAf29EqVU?si=244c1ef2dea9432a\n**Tags**:  #triage\n***\n\n1st phd thesis on corporate culture (1969), first culture shaping consultancy firm (1978). \n\nCorporate culture and productivity. It is easier to decide a change than to make people change.\nOrganizations as dysfunctional families, trust issues, resistence to change... No matter how good is the idea, it is hard to implement.\n\nCompanies, like people, has a personality. \n\n[Tipping point](https://www.thoughtco.com/malcolm-gladwell-tipping-point-theory-3026765), the culture is the greatest determinant of survival of an organization. \n\nUnsconscious resistence to change. You have to change people minds to curious instead of judgemental. \n\nWhy don't you complain about gravity? You don't wake in the morning and say oh my, another day with gravity. Stop complaining about things you cannot do anything about. Stoicism powa.\n\nYou have to untrain the blame culture. As a manager you have the win/lose mindset (prefer not lose) and also this mindset in which you cannot make mistakes. So if a project is falling behind you look for someone else to blame. But what you have to ask is what can you do in this context to make it work?\n\nHow do change adults habits? You need an epiphany. Covid was an unfreezing moment. \n\nCulture is the way people behave and work together: accountable vs victims, collaborative vs territorial, resist change vs open to change, curious vs judgemental.  Culture is the same across the world, the difference is style. \n\nShadow of the leaders: How CEOs and senior leaders behave goes down in the organization. You need to start change at the top.\n\nThere is a huge void in people feeling appreciated and valued in organizations. Younger generation needs healthy organizacions with cultures that respect people, appreciative. \n\nEncouraging empowerment in teams: Training accountability + (inspiring, appreciating people for doing the right thing)\n\nThe rate of change pushes the need of agile companies. \n\nCulture is the enabler of all initiatives. The main enablers of culture: having purpose, performance value: accountability. Bedrock of honest and integrity. \n\nIncentives for performance.  Recognising culture. Appreciative feedback and constructive feedback. Got a recognised by your boss in front of your peers. \n\nCash rewards + jerk supervisors you won't get the grass cut. \n\nHow do you build trust? Openness builds trust. Transparency builds trust. Vulnerability builds trust.  Leaders must show vulnearable, be open, consistent, dependable, appreciating...\n\nDisconnected initiatives != transformative change. \n\nLeaders need to lead with the why, not the what. What it makes a difference, Why you are important to me. Values != leadership. Leaders need to model things in the organization. \n\nEgo factor in the culture for a balanced organization. If leaders are humble, vulnerable. Company with big ego = problems. Confidence and intention, not for ego. \n\nBe here now. Be present. Not wandering mind.

Perception of your work is really important to build trust. \n\t\t\t- Explain what's happening behind the scenes\n\t\t\t- Factor in unknowns when giving estimates: Explain there is data you never looked at. If you have never done, say it. \n\t\t\t- Be explicit about when someone will hear from you next. Be more predictable. Be clear of hidden costs and explain how your constraints impact delivery. RTB = run-the-business work you need to do to keep the lights on. Make this a visible part of your roadmap. Be clear that maintenance is needed. \n\t\t\t- DACI: Driver, Approver, Consulted, Informed. Use [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DGRlGq8nffTpLg5OB1fjnKNY4O4j6_yogq18q88HafE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\t\t\t- Don't act like a service team. You don't let them treat you like a service desk. No one likes to be treated like a service team, on the other hand people usually want requests to be well described. You don't want to build transactional relationship. Learn the domain because it is critical for interpretation and mapping to semantic concept that is valuable for the organization.  Domain knowledge helps not getting nontrivial knowledge. Put yourself in the stakeholder's shoes, they might have lots of pressure or they might have time constrains. You should commit to the same goals, you should feel responsible to make PMs get faster to a goal. This also creates tighter bonds. \n\t\t- Build engagement: If we want our organizations to use data in their decision making process we need to help them to do it \n\t\t\t- Make your work easy to consume:  \n\t\t\t\t- Focus on what your stakeholders can control, if you give them good choices backed up by your analysis they will demand more. \n\t\t\t\t- Make your work linkable, make it concrete somehow: documentation, a dashboard, a slide deck. It helps making decisions without you in the loop. Easy to reference, easy to build upon. \n\t\t\t\t- Know when to make a snack vs prepare a meal. : Modularise analysis in small chunks that people can consume. A meal can also be made up of small components that can be digest easily. \n\t\t\t- Be predictable:\n\t\t\t\t- Reliability and consistency earn more trust than speed\n\t\t\t\t- Decide how you will push value to stakeholders\n\t\t\t\t- Act like you have paying customers: [Semanting versioning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-semantic-versioning/) is a good mental model, to frame how significant your contributions are. \n\t\t\t- Find ways to surprise and delight:\n\t\t\t\t- Share unexpected findings and thoughtful innovations\n\t\t\t\t- Packages them well. If you do this it is really important to contextualise. Be a sumellier, build taste with easy wines, then move to more complex wines. Give people things that you know they like, show them gradually what it is possible. \n\t\t\t\t- Don't overindex on this. Use it judiciously.\n\t\t\t- Set a good example, then be willing to let go. Show them how it is to use well data, but don't try to be always the mediator. Let them work and explore the data, make mistakes and let it go.\n![[Pasted image 20220722093303.png]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T22:54:09.686473094Z","tags":null},"/notes/literature-notes/Talks/Talks":{"title":"","content":"%% Begin Waypoint %%\n- [[Ds Managers Guide.

It is a personal website where I can share my thoughts, ideas, and knowledge in an interconnected and non-linear way. Unlike a traditional blog or website, a digital garden is designed to be ever-evolving and growing, with the content being constantly updated and interconnected through hyperlinks, allowing for a more fluid and organic way of organizing and sharing information. You can find a great introduction to digital Gardens in this post by [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)\n\nYou can find the following notes in this garden:\n1.  Fleeting notes: These are notes that capture passing thoughts or ideas, often written quickly and informally. They may not be fully formed or well-developed, but can serve as a starting point for further exploration or reflection.\n\n2.  Seed notes: Similar to fleeting notes, seed notes are small ideas that can be expanded upon in the future. They may be a single word or phrase that captures an idea, concept, or inspiration.\n\n3.  Literature notes: These are notes that capture ideas or insights from books, articles, or other written works. They may summarize key points, highlight important quotes, or provide personal reflections on the content.\n\n4.  Project notes: These are notes that capture ideas, plans, or progress related to a particular project or endeavor. They may include brainstorming sessions, to-do lists, or progress updates.\n\n5.  Meta notes: These are notes that reflect on the process of note-taking and organizing within the digital garden itself. They may provide insights or tips on how to use the garden effectively, or reflect on the value of note-taking and reflection in general.\n\n6.  Evergreen notes: These are notes that focus on fundamental concepts or principles, and are designed to remain relevant and useful over time. They may include definitions of key concepts, explanations of fundamental principles or theories, summaries of important books or articles, guides or tutorials on how to do something, or lists of resources or tools that are useful for a particular purpose.","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T22:54:09.686473094Z","tags":null}}
