&lt;p>In data science, a similar concept can be applied to the use of by-products from one analysis or modeling process as inputs for another analysis or modeling process, leading to a more efficient and effective overall data science workflow. For example, the output of one machine learning model can be used as input for another model, or data generated as a by-product of one analysis can be repurposed for another analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This approach can help reduce data waste, increase efficiency, and improve overall data-driven decision-making. In this way you may create a network of intertwined processes. It reminds me of the way stitch fix presented the
